我都懒得问了
I-I won't even ask.

164
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,720
最好不过了
Probably best.

165
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,150
再说  我们还有更紧要的事情得讨论

这个

网络数据也删除了

你说的那个界
That line you're talking about,

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,890
我很早就越过了
I crossed it a long time ago.

现在我们得处理DNA样本

174
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,660
联调局把它放在纽约一家安全实验室里

你教本瑟姆女士班里的学生

187
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,140
那作业似乎没什么意义
Well, the assignment seemed a bit remedial.

188
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,260
-我希望能教  -教课是本瑟姆女士的工作
- I was hoping to teach-- - Teaching is Ms. Benthem's job.

189
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,510
你的工作是监督她的学生

190
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,620
完成她布置的作业

她觉得要能甩掉学生和老师
She thinks schools would run better

193
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,940
学校能运转得更加良好呢

205
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,110
我查看了他哥哥的死亡报告

207
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,210
他哥哥就死在他面前

208
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,460
没错  但事有蹊跷
Yeah, but something's not right.

209
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,660
我查阅了当晚所有的事故报告

站警向调度请求支援 
The transit cop called for a backup, to dispatch,

211

212
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,300
为什么站警会取消支援申请呢
Why would a policeman rescind a request for backup?

213
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,720
我也想知道
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

214
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,930
我正等着调度报告给我答案呢
I'm waiting on the transcripts to find out why.

215

也许我该去见见迦勒的母亲

216
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,120
看看他的家庭生活如何

217
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,600

迦勒知道每道题的答案
You see, Caleb knew the answer to every question.

223
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,750
但他刻意有选择的答题
But he chose only to fill in every other one.

224
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,240
我不明白  他故意的吗
I don't get it. He tanked on purpose?

225
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,200
为什么要隐藏自己是天才呢
Why would you want to hide the fact you're a genius?

226
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,320
{\an8}浪费时间

227
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
到底为什么呢
Why, indeed?

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,630
迦勒  聊两句
Caleb, a word?

229
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,050

无疑冒犯  斯威夫特先生
No offense, Mr. Swift,

231
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,740

有人知道是什么意思吗
Can any of you tell me what it means?

234
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,160
提出问题我也接受
I'll settle for an intelligent question here.

235
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,100
我朋友有个问题  斯威夫特先生

237
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,560
我们几时会用得上

238
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
我来告诉你
Let me show you.

239
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,500

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,390
后面一直有
It keeps on going.

243
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,650
无穷无尽
Forever.

244
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,730
永不重复
Without ever repeating.

245
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,900
就是说在这串数字中

都在其中某处
It's all in there somewhere.

251
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,190
如果把这些数字转换为字母

252
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,660
就能得到所有的单词
you would have every word that ever existed

253
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,570

它有什么用
what it's good for...

262
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,380
取决于你们
well, that would be up to you.

269
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,960
你自己住吗
So you, uh, you live alone?

270
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,650
还有我儿子迦勒
With my son Caleb.

271
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,630
我们没多余的房间  迦勒睡沙发
We don't have a lot of room, so Caleb takes the couch.

272
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,440
工作电话  稍等一下
That's work. Just give me a sec.

273
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,950
你和你儿子最近注意到什么可疑情况吗

引人注意的那种
Anyone who stands out?

276
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,090
我没什么印象
Nothing I can think of.

277

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,270
有些家庭日子不好过  你懂的吧
Some families have it rough, you know?

280
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,680

285
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,470
上班迟到  开门时摇摇晃晃
Late for work, rolling out the door with the shakes.

286
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,890
估计她酗酒
My guess is she's hitting the bottle.

287
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,360
难怪迦勒不在乎自己的成绩
No wonder Caleb doesn't care about his grades.

288
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,170
有那两个毒贩的消息吗
Anything new on our two dealers?

289
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,600
迭戈斯・奎兹和罗尼・山姆斯
Diego Velasquez and Ronnie Samms.

290
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,740
以前替一个叫洛伦佐的贩货
Used to deal for a guy by the name of Lorenzo.

291
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,110
那种人你肯定不想惹
Type of guy you don't wanna cross.

292
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,100
不过现在他们给一个新人卖命
But now they're working for some new up-and-comer

293
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,280
缉毒部门还没查出是谁
that narcotics hasn't been able to identify.

294
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,160
我跟你说  那学校绝对是雷区啊
I tell you, that school's a real minefield.

295
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,190
好的
Okay.

296
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,870
你不会说出去的对吧  头
Gonna keep your mouth shut, right, Chief?

297
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,540
当然
Yeah, sure.

298
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,550
就一点
Except to say this.

299
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,210
下次你们再想卖摇头丸
The next time you decide you want to deal E

300
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,660
给摆明了这辈子没买过的孩子时
to a kid who's clearly never bought in his entire life,

301
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,470
到楼下的储藏室去
do it in the locker room downstairs,

302
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,380
因为这二货一用
because this jumpy fool

303
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,910
就相当于脑门上直书大字"吸过毒啦"
is a neon sign shouting "Drugs Ahoy"...

304
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,320
头
Chief.

305
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,010
够了
That's enough!

306
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,660
除非你们想去校长办公室解决
Unless you want to settle this in the principal's office.

307
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,880
你还好吗
Are you okay?

308
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,490
我不需要你帮忙  行不
I don't need your help...okay?

309
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,360
"黑客"曾指那些勤劳的编码员
"Hacker" used to refer to industrious coders

310
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,210
他们推动了现代电脑的发展
who pushed the boundaries of modern computing.

311
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,190
这名词随后变了味道
Then that word became misappropriated

312
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,710
指那些行为过界违法乱纪
by those who pushed the boundaries so far

313
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,620
最后要去坐牢的人了
that they ended up with jail time.

314
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,150
例如八十年代的凯文・米特尼克
Like Kevin Mitnick, back in the 1980s.

315
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,850
他只不过想看看系统如何运作
He was just trying to see how stuff worked.

316
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,800
米特尼克当时是在寻找系统漏洞
Mitnick was looking for flaws in the system.

317
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,670
他的手段犯了法
And he did so by breaking the law.

318
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,090
但他证明了漏洞在人  而非编码
But he proved people were the flaw, not the code.

319
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,980
现在他们花大钱请他
Now they're paying him millions

320
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,440
做那些当初害他蹲监狱的事
for the same thing that got him locked up in the first place.

321
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,400
或许最为臭名昭著的黑客
Perhaps the most notorious hacker of them all

322
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,760
是成功溜走的那位
was the one that got away.

323
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,300
当美国政府正试图
Back when Uncle Sam was trying

324
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,120
用铁栅栏框住刚刚萌芽的互联网
to maintain its iron grip on the budding internet--

325
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,130
或者说"阿帕网"  当时是这么叫的
or Arpanet, as it was known then--

326
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,820
这位黑客  编码员  侵入了系统
this hacker, this coder, hacked into the system

327
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,520
使其曝光
and laid its secrets bare,

328
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,320
让互联网成为公共平台
ensuring that the internet would become an open forum.

329
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,220
这名黑客厉害之处在于从未被抓住
Plus that hacker made his mark without ever getting busted.

330
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,580
没错
True.

331
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,300
无论是谁  此人仍逍遥在外
Whoever it was, that person's still out there.

332
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,930
我来问问那天才男孩
Hey, I'm checking on the boy genius.

333
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,550
不是说你  另外那个
Not you, the other one.

334
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,440
看来他编码颇有两下子
Turns out he's quite the little coder.

335
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,290
他正着手编写一个硕大的程序
He's been coding a massive program.

336
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,020
而且是手写  因为他家里都没电脑
In longhand, as he doesn't have a computer at home.

337
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,200
然后再写进实验室的电脑里
Then he writes it into a computer in the lab.

338
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,450
如果我发现的这部分编码
If the partial code I've discovered

339
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,660
真的是他作品的一部分
is a snapshot of his work...

340
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,840
那他正在发明的东西
what he's creating...

341
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,030
会震惊世界
could be groundbreaking.

342
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,770
弗斯科警探  能帮我个忙吗
Detective Fusco, can you do something for me?

343
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,300
我要你去跟踪迭戈和罗尼
I need you to follow Diego and Ronnie.

344
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,770
今天迦勒和他们吵了一架
Caleb had a run-in with them today

345
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,090
可能会出麻烦
that might lead to trouble.

346
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,310
-他们有什么恩怨吗  -难说
- Is there a history there? - Hard to tell.

347
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,450
但迦勒看上去
But Caleb seemed

348
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,840
对他们的毒品交易有很大兴趣
to take an outsized interest in their drug dealing.

349
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,270
如果有人暗中操控
If someone's pulling their strings,

350
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,700
我想知道那个人是谁
I'd like to know who.

351
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,940
芬奇  这个毒贩子  非常谨慎
Finch, whoever this drug dealer is, he's careful.

352
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,050
警探  你计划的第一步进行得如何
Detective, how goes phase one of your plan?

353
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,800
我收到了你寄来的包裹
I got the package you sent over,

354
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,530
但要我这浑水
but if I'm gonna wade in this pool,

355
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,050
我需要确切的数据
I need the right specs.

356
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,220
好的
Yeah.

357
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,120
正在发给你
Sending them to you now.

358
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,690
关在里克岛的那位就指望你了
Our friend in Rikers is counting on you.

359
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,580
{\an1}{\pos(60,101)}血统:欧洲
身高:183-193厘米
瞳色:蓝色
发色:棕色
需排除的医疗情况:
囊性纤维化  遗传性血色沉着

360
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,930
-好的  -搞定他们  警探
- Okay. - Knock 'em dead, Detective.

361
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,740
他们根本不会知道自己怎么栽的
They won't know what hit 'em.

362
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,850
我想要
Hi, I'd like to have--

363
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,260
第一杯我请
the first one, on me.

364
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,120
你好吗
How are you doing?

365
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,870
谢了  不过  我想要的是
Thanks, but, I'm looking for something a little more...

366
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,510
特定的类型
specific.

367
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,630
弗斯科警探  那年轻人开始行动了
Detective Fusco, our young man is on the move.

368
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,130
载你回家吧
Give you a ride home?

369
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,430
我的车就停在那儿
Car is right down there.

370
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,600
好啊
I'd like that.

371
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,310
我得承认  你刚开始吓到我了
I have to admit, you kind of threw me at first.

372
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,840
一直不停地问我的生活背景
Asking all those questions about my background,

373
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,870
健康状况
my health.

374
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,370
我都弄不清是在调情呢
I couldn't tell whether we were flirtin'

375
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,980
还是在查病历
or fillin' out my medical history.

376
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,020
我很实际
I'm a practical girl.

377
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,840
喜欢先了解自己能进展到哪一步
I like to know what I'm getting into.

378
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,040
那我们
So are we...

379
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
今晚能有进展吗
getting into anything tonight?

380
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,840
我有
I am.

381
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,170
我不知道怎么回事  可是
I don't know what happened, but...

382
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,830
我都没喝很多酒
I didn't even have that much to drink.

383
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,640
张大嘴  好家伙
Open wide, big fella.

384
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,130
我一整晚都跟着这些毒资
I've been following this drug money all night.

385
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,340
迭戈和罗尼拿了一袋子
Diego and Ronnie handed a bagful of it

386
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,960
给了一个流浪汉  我跟着他
to a homeless guy, who I followed

387
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,180
钱被丢到一处转账的地方
till he dumped it off at a money transfer place.

388
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,100
那儿的工作人员把它
The worker there wired it

389
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,970
送到城另一头的钱行
to another money hub across town,

390
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,950
我赶到时刚巧看见
where I hoofed it over there just in time

391
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,670
另一个人来取现金
to see some other guy pick up the cash

392
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,560
然后扔进了皇冠高地这儿的一个邮箱
and drop it in a PO box right here in Crown Heights.

393
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,080
那位神秘的毒枭在洗钱
Our mysterious drug lord is laundering his money,

394
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,740
让它无源可溯
making it untraceable.

395
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,020
倒也并非无源可溯
Well, not untraceable enough.

396
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,070
来取这笔钱的人  就是我们要找的
Whoever comes in for this cash is our guy.

397
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,850
你在哪儿
Where are you anyway?

398
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,900
我正看着你呢
I'm looking at you.

399
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,900
你不是在跟着那孩子吗
Thought you were following the kid.

400
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,480
我是啊
I am.

401
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,900
-给你  先生  -谢谢
- Here you go, sir. - Thanks.

402
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,060
扯了大蛋了
Well, I'll be damned.

403
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,230
那位神秘毒枭就是迦勒
Our mystery drug lord is Caleb.

404
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,330
卷子批完了
Graded your quizzes.

405
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,410
有些同学挺认真的
Some of you have been paying attention.

406
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,730
迦勒  你可以考更好的
Caleb, I expected better.

407
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,560
-那孩子又怎么了  -迦勒刚收到信息
- What did the kid do now? - Caleb just got a message.

408
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,600
他要在两点去见供货人
He's supposed to meet his supplier at 2:00.

409
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,470
我们得跟着他
We have to follow him.

410
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,700
小鬼头  保密工作到家啊
Tricky little bastard, keeping his identity a secret.

411
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,300
年龄大他一倍的毒贩都没这么精明
He's better than most dealers twice his age.

412
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,870
我一定向他转告你对他
I'll be sure and tell him how impressed you are

413
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,470
犯罪手段的欣赏
with his criminal aptitude.

414
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,610
贝克纳刚刚侵入迦勒的账号  警探
Beckman just broke into Caleb's account, Detective.

415
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,110
他把一个名叫17-6-21的文件拷到了优盘上
He's copying a file named 17-6-21 onto a thumb drive.

416
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,080
无论迦勒做的是什么
Whatever Caleb's making...

417
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,840
他老师对此的兴趣  超出学术范围了
his teacher's interest in it... is far from academic.

418
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,490
菲普斯先生
Oh, Mr. Phipps!

419
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,540
我正赶着出去呢
Look, I'm kind of on my way somewhere.

420
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,120
我只是想把东西还给你
I just wanted to return something of yours.

421
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,570
你昨天落下了
You dropped this yesterday.

422
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,500
你别再翻垃圾桶了  斯威夫特先生
You really got to stop going through the trash, Mr. Swift.

423
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,620
我以前也做过编程
You know, I used to do a little coding myself.

424
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,620
你这段非常出色
That's an elegant string you have.

425
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,690
但我觉得如果你想要用
But it occurs to me that if you want

426
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,050
多线程编法
to implement multi-threading,

427
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,750
用原子变量更好
you'd do better to use atomic variables.

428
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,550
个人想法
Just a thought.

429
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,680
等等  这样  这样可以
Wait, that-- that works.

430
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,820
是的  所以我才如此建议
Yes, that's why I suggested it.

431
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,060
谢谢
Thanks.

432
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,510
希望你随身带了适用的武器  警探
I hope you have your service weapon with you, Detective.

433
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,590
带了  我还给你拿了台机关枪呢
Yeah, I got you a machine gun too.

434
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,000
真幽默  警探  别跟丢了他
Very funny, Detective. Let's try not to lose him.

435
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,970
罗马
Yo, Roman.

436
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,240
在吗
You here?

437
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,370
天啊
Oh, jeez.

438
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,290
你是为这而来的  是吧
That's what you came for, right?

439
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,210
说说看
So tell me...

440
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,200
你这么聪明的孩子为什么会蠢到
why would a kid like you do something so stupid

441
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,110
敢到我地盘上的学校里贩
like dealing at a school in my neighborhood?

442
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,680
那是洛伦佐  迭戈和罗尼以前的老大
That's Lorenzo, all right, Diego and Ronnie's old boss.

443
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,980
有啥计划
What's the plan?

444
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,780
我靠
Crap.

445
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,900
罗马遭受这小意外之前
You know, before he had his little accident here...

446
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,780
告诉我说你想
Roman was telling me how you're just trying

447
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,690
弄笔钱  准备出远门
to score some bank to take a big trip.

448
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,970
真的吗
That true?

449
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,700
是的
Yeah.

450
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,030
把卖给我客人的货款一分不少地还给我
You pay back every dime you made selling to my customers,

451
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,640
我就放你四肢俱全地出城
I'll let you leave town intact.

452
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,260
就在这里  明晚八点
Be back here tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m.,

453
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,290
否则我去找你算账
or I'll come find you.

454
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,060
你让我一天内怎么弄到那么多现金
How do you expect me to score that kind of cash in a day?

455
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,510
冷静
Relax.

456
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,030
好吧  我去  抢个银行好了
All right, I'll... rob a bank or something.

457
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,790
我欣赏你
I like you.

458
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,550
够
You got brass.

459
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,920
但如果明晚你没出现
But you don't show tomorrow night...

460
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,760
打碎的就远不止是你的腿了
break a lot more than your legs.

461
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,610
这孩子很坚强
Kid's got it tough.

462
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,130
但跟毒贩较劲儿
But picking a fight with a drug dealer?

463
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,300
天才办傻事啊
A dumb move for a genius.

464
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,840
为什么一个前途无量的年轻人
Why would a young man with such potential

465
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,720
甘为一点毒资孤注一掷呢
risk it all just to get some easy drug money?

466
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,980
我认为问题不是钱
I don't think it's about the money.

467
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,370
而是他的哥哥
I think it's about the brother.

468
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,890
瑞安・菲普斯死亡那晚的调度报告
Dispatch transcripts from the night Ryan Phipps died.

469
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,000
填报告的站警一开始申请支援
Now the transit cop who filed the report called for backup...

470
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,470
因为迦勒最初报告说
because Caleb initially reported

471
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,840
有两名年轻人挤瑞安
that two youths got into a shoving match with Ryan,

472
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,930
把他推下的轨道
pushed him onto the tracks.

473
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,210
但是警察随后取消了支援申请
But the officer cancelled the backup call

474
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,170
写成是意外事故
and filed an accident report instead.

475
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,660
为什么迦勒要改变说法呢
Why would Caleb change his story?

476
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,600
也许他认识凶手
Maybe he knew the killers.

477
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,230
也许他想要自己找他们复仇
Maybe he was thinking about taking care of them himself.

478
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,260
迭戈和罗尼吗
Diego and Ronnie?

479
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,130
他操纵那些二货
He's manipulating those morons.

480
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,820
让他们为他贩毒
Got 'em running drugs for him,

481
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,060
还傻傻地被蒙在鼓里
and they don't even know it.

482
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,550
贝克纳在专心研究什么呢
What's Beckner so absorbed in?

483
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,430
是迦勒的作品
That's Caleb's work.

484
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,110
霍华德  我是克里斯
Howard, it's Chris.

485
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,530
我们今晚见下面好吗
Can you still meet up tonight?

486
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,590
我带去的东西肯定会让你大吃一惊
I think you'll be impressed with what you see.

487
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,510
太好了  那边见
Great. I'll see you there.

488
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,930
-计划有变  警探  -我猜猜
- Change of plans, Detective. - Let me guess.

489
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,870
你要我一个人盯着这小爱因斯坦一整晚
You need me to keep an eye on little Einstein, myself, tonight.

490
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,530
随时向我报告
Keep me posted.

491
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,260
风投公司的合伙人先生
So, Mr. Venture Capital Firm Partner...

492
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,450
初级合伙人
Junior partner.

493
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,540
离豪华大办公室还远着呢
Long way from the corner office.

494
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,800
还是得步步小心
Still have to watch my step.

495
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,780
-谨慎选项目啊  -我明白
- Pick my projects carefully. - I get it.

496
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,790
你要是看了这个
When you see this...

497
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,330
那就让我看看吧  克里斯
Well, then, let's-- let's just see it, Chris,

498
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,370
看完我就能回去见老婆孩子了
so I can get back to my wife and kids.

499
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,460
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

500
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,540
国会图书馆
The library of congress.

501
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,200
什么
What?

502
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,810
235兆兆的内容
235 terabytes on--

503
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,450
存在这一个优盘中
on one thumb drive?

504
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,920
互联网正受困于流媒体
The internet's choking on streaming video.

505
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,540
需要新的压缩算法
They're gonna need a new compression algorithm

506
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,930
以保持增长
to continue growing.

507
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,100
我成功了
And I've got it.

508
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,630
我只需要一家像你们这样的公司注资
All I need is an investment from a firm like yours

509
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,160
帮我启动
to help me get it off the ground.

510
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,260
那个  是这样的  克里斯
So...here's the thing, Chris.

511
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,880
我还记得你大学的编码水平
I remember your code from back in college.

512
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,310
你也就是中上水平
You were a medium talent at best.

513
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,910
克里斯・贝克纳不可能
There is no way that that Chris Beckner

514
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,250
设计出如此非凡的东西
designed something this extraordinary.

515
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,380
跟我们的老朋友不同
Unlike our old friends,

516
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,170
大学并非我的巅峰
I didn't peak in college.

517
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,640
这么说没其他人知道这个项目
So no one else knows about this project?

518
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,670
程序员  开发员
Programmers? Developers?

519
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,830
或其他的牵扯
No other entanglements?

520
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,170
我肯定
I can guarantee it.

521
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,100
但愿如此吧
Well, let's hope so.

522
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,500
因为我也不想有人拦住你拿到一张
Because I would hate for anyone to come between you

523
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,810
我相信是天文数字的支票
and what I believe is going to be a very large check.

524
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,810
终于查到了那位站警  墨菲
Finally tracked down that transit cop, Murphy.

525
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,080
就是那位迦勒的哥哥死时第一个到现场的
The one who was first on the scene when Caleb's brother died.

526
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,050
已经给他留了信息
Left a message for him to come down

527
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,340
他换岗后就来八局
to the Eighth after his shift.

528
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,520
说到这个  那孩子呢
Speaking of which, where's the kid now?

529
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,560
在到处挪钱  数目巨大
He's moving money around, large amounts.

530
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
准备现金给洛伦佐吗
Getting the cash to pay off Lorenzo?

531
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,360
不  他在设信托基金
No, he set up some kind of a trust,

532
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,930
把所有的钱都存进去了
and he's pouring all his money into it.

533
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,320
也许他在考虑出那趟
Maybe he's thinking about taking that trip

534
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,340
他一直挂在嘴边的远门了
he's always talking about.

535
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,750
{\pos(152,87)}被复制的手机

536
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,750
{\pos(161,104)}克里斯・贝克纳

537
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,750
{\pos(204,163)}发短信给迦勒・菲普斯
今晚八点学校见面好吗

538
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,700
贝克纳刚给迦勒发了短信
Beckner just texted Caleb.

539
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,620
他想晚上八点见面
He wants to meet at 8:00 tonight.

540
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,830
那时他正好应该去见洛伦佐
The same time he's supposed to meet Lorenzo.

541
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,890
就算用量子力学算
And quantum physics notwithstanding,

542
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,620
他也没法分身两处
he can't be in two places at once.

543
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
除非我说对了  这孩子另有计划
Unless I'm right, and this kid's got a plan,

544
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,900
没时间应付两面来敌
time's running out on two fronts.

545
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,060
对他来说走为上策
Maybe skipping town's the best thing for him.

546
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,300
我们也正好可以专心救你家那位出去
Then we could focus some on getting your pal out of lockup.

547
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,180
里瑟先生能照顾好自己  警探
Mr. Reese can take care of himself, Detective.

548
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,420
现在  他有贵人相助
And right now, he's in very capable hands.

549
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,620
卡特警探
Detective Carter,

550
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,230
抓紧时间  那位还在里克岛监狱里呢
time is ticking away fast for our friend in Rikers.

551
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,520
别担心  我心里有数
Don't worry. I know what to do.

552
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,170
又来了
Here you go.

553
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,310
抱歉  宝贝
Sorry, honey.

554
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,230
明天我就会好起来的
I'll be better tomorrow.

555
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,610
我保证
I promise.

556
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,670
是啊
Yeah.

557
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,450
明天一切都会好起来的  妈
Everything's gonna be better tomorrow, ma.

558
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,560
我是弗斯科警探
Detective Fusco.

559
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,570
提醒一下今晚我需要你的帮助
I just want to remind you that I need your help tonight.

560
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,330
迦勒有两个约会
Caleb has two appointments,

561
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,850
我们不知道他要去哪个
and we have no idea which one he intends to keep.

562
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,330
我会去
I'll be there.

563
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,830
你有事找我
You wanted to speak with me?

564
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,720
是的  坐吧  墨菲警官
Yeah, have a seat, Officer Murphy.

565
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,040
之前也说了  我
Like I said, I'm, uh...

566
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,310
在跟个悬案
working on a cold case.

567
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,680
乘客被推
Commuter got pushed.

568
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,620
在找相关案件  发现了这个
Looking for related cases, this popped up.

569
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,780
瑞安・菲普斯
Ryan Phipps.

570
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,700
上边说你是第一个到现场的
Says here you were first on the scene?

571
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,760
对  没错
Yeah, that's right.

572
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,490
那孩子还有六个月就要满十八岁了
Kid was six months shy of his 18th birthday.

573
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,290
跟他弟弟迦勒一起回家
Coming home with his little brother Caleb.

574
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,570
瑞安有点哄闹  喝了点酒
Ryan was horsing around, drinking a little bit.

575
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,270
滑下轨道  被撞了
Slipped on the tracks and got clipped.

576
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,710
是是  我记得
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

577
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,730
那案子令人痛苦
It was a rough one.

578
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,030
因为死者是孩子
Because it was a kid?

579
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,880
还是因为你没有完整上报
Or because you didn't report the whole story?

580
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,190
我知道有孩子把瑞安推下轨道
I know about the kids who pushed Ryan on the tracks.

581
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,420
我不是警探  警探
I'm no detective, Detective.

582
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,200
我只是个小站警
I'm just a lowly transit cop.

583
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,470
我这辈子见识的也不少了
I seen a lot of things in my time.

584
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,700
我做过很多让我后悔的决定
And I made a lot of decisions I regret.

585
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,710
但这个我永不后悔
This is not one of those times.

586
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,660
要是迦勒变成杀人凶手你也许就要后悔了
You may regret it when Caleb becomes a killer.

587
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,910
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

588
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,770
你认为复仇就能帮迦勒缓解
You think revenge is gonna make Caleb feel better

589
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,080
亲眼见到哥哥惨死之痛吗
about seeing his brother die?

590
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,860
完全不靠谱  警探
You're a long ways off, Detective.

591
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,230
那就告诉我点靠谱的
Then give me some directions.

592
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,940
我之前对那孩子施压
You know, I did to the kid

593
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,090
就像你现在对我
what you're doing to me right now.

594
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,180
当我让他描述另外几名孩子的情况时
When I asked him for descriptions of the other kids...

595
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,500
说法变来变去
kept changing it up.

596
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,550
根本没有另外的孩子
There were no other kids.

597
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,900
没有
No.

598
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,910
只是俩兄弟喝醉了
Just two brothers drinking.

599
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,780
无聊了
Bored.

600
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,710
等着坐车回家
Waiting for a train to go home.

601
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,140
所以就赌彼此  敢不敢穿轨道
So they dare each other to, uh...cross the tracks.

602
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,500
就是看火车来之前你能来回
You know, how many times you can cross back and forth

603
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,850
穿几次轨道
before a train comes?

604
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,820
瑞安不想输给自己的弟弟
Well, Ryan doesn't want to lose to his little brother.

605
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,550
一个孩子穿过了  另一个没穿过
One kid makes it, the other kid doesn't.

606
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,750
我不知道算谁赢了
I don't know who got the better deal.

607
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,020
所以我告诉他我在报告里会略去不写
So I told him I'd leave all that out of the report,

608
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,300
只写是意外事故
write it up as an accident,

609
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,790
让他为自己保密
and for him to keep it to himself.

610
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,830
无论他怎么告诉他的妈妈
So no matter what he had to tell his mom...

611
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,280
或者警察  或者上帝
or the cops, or God himself...

612
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,360
他哥哥也不会复生了
nothing was gonna bring his brother back.

613
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,340
要怎么说呢
What can I tell you?

614
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,650
有些事就是无法挽回
Some things you can't fix.

615
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,610
我刚和墨菲谈过了
I just talked to Murphy.

616
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,660
他哥哥的死是场意外事故
The brother's death was an accident,

617
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,620
但听起来迦勒为此自责
but it sounds like Caleb blames himself for it.

618
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,150
这可有问题了  警探
Well, that's a problem, Detective,

619
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,240
因为我跟丢迦勒了
Because I lost Caleb.

620
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,960
他上了一辆公车  我还没上去车就开走了
He got on a city bus, and it left before I could catch up.

621
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,930
你开玩笑呢
You're kidding me.

622
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,660
也许我需要得提醒你一下鄙人所能颇多
May I remind you that of the many things I'm equipped to do,

623
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,610
但追踪绝非其中之一
pursuit would not be chief among them.

624
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,400
我们现在唯一的选择就是等在迦勒
Our only option now is to wait for Caleb

625
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,410
可能出现的两个地方
at the two places he's likeliest to turn up.

626
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,190
我去学校监视贝克纳
I'll stake out Beckner at the high school.

627
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,990
你盯那位被侵权的毒犯
You keep an eye out for our aggrieved drug dealer.

628
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,550
叫上所有人  砍死那小子
Get everyone, and hunt that kid down!

629
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,320
那孩子没出现  洛伦佐想要他命了
Our boy is a no-show, and Lorenzo wants his head.

630
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,710
你去找那孩子
You worry about the kid.

631
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,350
我来搞定洛伦佐
I'll take care of Lorenzo.

632
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,270
他也没在这里  警探
He's not here either, Detective.

633
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,050
我可能来晚了
I may be too late.

634
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,230
斯威夫特  你在这儿干嘛
Swift, what are you doing here?

635
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,110
我也想问你同样的问题
I was gonna ask you the same.

636
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,340
-我把论文丢在了  -住口吧
- I-I left some papers on-- - Stop it!

637
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,160
我看到你侵入了迦勒的账号
I saw you break into Caleb's account

638
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,390
拷了他的文件
and copy his files.

639
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,510
你就如此自甘堕落吗
Is that what you're willing to stoop to?

640
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,470
偷学生的作品冒充自己的成果
Stealing the work of a student and passing it off as your own?

641
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,540
我犯不着在这里
I am not gonna stand here

642
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,040
听任代课老师指责我剽窃
and be accused of plagiarism by some substitute teacher.

643
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,810
再说  我干嘛要拷C分学生的作品
Besides, why would I copy work off of a "C"-grade student?

644
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,770
因为迦勒绝非平庸之辈
Because Caleb is anything but average.

645
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,760
你心里清楚
And you know it.

646
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,080
所以你才把他的作品给你朋友看
That's why you took his work to your friend.

647
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,440
迦勒
Caleb...

648
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,140
几个月前让我
approached me a few months ago

649
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,850
看他正在做的这个项目
about this project he was working on.

650
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,810
我本来很怀疑  但当我看到编码后
I was skeptical, but when I...saw his code

651
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,010
简直不敢相信自己的眼睛  所以我决定帮他
I couldn't believe my eyes, so I decided to help him.

652
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,660
-用自己独揽来帮他  -不
- By cutting him out of it. - No.

653
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,170
他只想要钱
All he wanted was some money up front

654
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,490
准备出远门
for this trip that he wants to take.

655
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,810
说他不想要任何荣誉
Said he didn't even want any credit.

656
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,410
你怎么能同意呢
Why on earth would you agree to that?

657
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,460
我没有
I didn't.

658
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,680
自己看
Read it for yourself.

659
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,520
迦勒会得到所有的荣誉
Caleb gets all the credit.

660
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,640
我是为了要省事点
It was just easier for me to...

661
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,970
才由我出面给他看
pitch the idea with him myself...

662
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
好拿到启动资金
get some capital...

663
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,630
然后真正的幕后高手会现身
and then reveal the true brain behind it.

664
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,840
他分给我一半  另一半要我
He offered me half if I put the other half

665
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,610
存入他为他妈妈开设的信托基金
in a trust that he set up for his mom.

666
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,300
但我会都给他
But I'm giving him the whole thing.

667
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,170
这是所有17-6-21的钱
All the money from 17-6-21.

668
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,510
17-6-21
17-6-21?

669
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,290
这是他给程序的命名
It's the name he gave the program.

670
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,310
他说这是什么纪念
He said it was some kind of dedication.

671
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,800
我告诉你  六个月后
Look, I am telling you, six months from now,

672
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,040
迦勒会成为全国最有钱的十八岁少年
Caleb is going to be the richest 18-year-old in the country.

673
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,870
不
No.

674
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,820
不  他不会
No, he won't.

690
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,930
你很聪明  迦勒
You're so smart, Caleb.

691
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,220
问点你不知道答案的问题吧
Ask me something you don't know.

692
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,500
行为鲁莽
The thing about being reckless...

693
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,130
甘愿冒险
taking chances...

694
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,250
犯下了很多错误
is that you make a lot of mistakes,

695
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,670
造成了很多不幸
cause a lot of grief.

696
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,780
准备向我宣讲所谓错误
Gonna start lecturing me on mistakes?

697
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,290
要我吸取教训
How I need to live and learn?

698
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,590
继续前行
Move on?

699
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,740
真鼓舞人心  斯威夫特先生
That's really inspiring, Mr. Swift.

700
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,670
我要站到桌子上为你鼓掌
I'd stand up on my desk and clap for you.

701
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,500
不过
But...

702
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,340
不
No.

703
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,030
你的错误  和我一样
Your mistakes, like mine,

704
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,740

are part of who you are now.

705
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,780
你无法弃之前行
You can't move on from that.

706
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,220
相信我
Believe me.

707
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,510
我犯过很多错
I've made a sizable number.

708
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,410
但是
But...

709
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,520
有时错误也会给你惊喜
sometimes your mistakes can surprise you.

710
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,540
譬如说  我最大的错误
My biggest mistake, for instance...

711
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,210
把我带到了这里

712
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,870

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,010
17年6个月零21天的生命
17 years, 6 months and 21 days into your life.

715
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,080
你哥哥死去的年龄

716
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,760
也是你选择结束自己生命的年龄

所以你看
So, you see...

719
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,030
也许你我之间是有共鸣的
maybe you and I are connected.

720
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,280
两个鲁莽的人
Two reckless people.

721
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,000
是吗  那有什么用
Yeah? Then what's the use?

722
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,350
我们只会破坏
We're just gonna keep breaking things...

723
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,510
一次又一次
over and over.

724
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,130
为什么不替大家省掉不幸呢
Why not save everyone the grief?

725
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,930
整个世界
The thing about the world is

726
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,870
没有多余的部分
that it doesn't have any extra pieces.

727
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,320
就像π  包含所有
It's like pi. It contains everything.

728
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,110
你去掉了一块
You remove a single piece...

729
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,780
就不成圆
No circle.

730
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,950
你的鲁莽  你的错误
Your recklessness, your mistakes,

731
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,400
使得你在他们说出
are the reason why, when they say

732
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,130
"你无法改变世界"时  拒绝相信
"You can't change the world," you won't listen.

733
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,000
这个世界
The world is better off

734
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,800
因为你我的存在才更好  迦勒  而非相反
with both of us in it, Caleb, rather than the alternative

735
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,180
是吗  你能确定
Yeah? You sure about that?

736
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,470
是的  你妈妈因为你的存在才更好
Yes, and your mom is better off with you in it.

737
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,840
如果你认为钱能代替你
If you think money can replace you...

738
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,400
你算错了
you haven't seen the whole equation.

739
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,570
说这句话的人曾以为
Take it from someone who thought

740
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,520
自己离开能够让其他人过得轻松点
that leaving would make it easier on everyone...

741
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
结果却并非如此
and then learned otherwise.

742
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,390
再说一遍
Say it to me again.

743
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,340
说慢点
Slowly.

744
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,850
根据实验室检验结果
According to the lab results,

745
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,930
我们从这四人身上提取的DNA
none of the DNA we took from these four men

746
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,850
和数据库的任何DNA都不匹配
matches any of the DNA in our database.

747
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,670
他们是清白的  长官  四个都是
They're clean, Sir. All four of 'em.

748
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
把所有的样本都送到匡提科
I want every one of those samples sent to Quantico,

749
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,720
检测DNA联合索引系统  检测是否有篡改
reviewed through CODIS, and inspected for tampering.

750
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,400
他们搞鬼了
They got to it.

751
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,330
虽然不知道怎么做的  但那群混蛋搞鬼了
I don't know how, but those bastards got to it.

752
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,410
快去
Go.

753
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,010
还有一件事
One more thing.

754
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,390
把卡特叫来
Get me Carter.

755
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,540
你应该小心处理你的编码
You really ought to be more careful with your code.

756
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,160
谢谢
Thanks.

757
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,300
我成长于冷战时期
I grew up during the Cold War...

758
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,330
那时电脑网络
when computer networks were just a gleam

759
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,320
在国防部眼里仅是一道微光
in the eye of the Department of Defense.

760
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,430
一切都非黑即白
Things seemed more black and white then.

761
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,320
阿帕网是新领域
Arpanet was the new frontier.

762
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,660
直到一个小孩用自制电脑
Till a kid with a homemade computer

763
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,380
彻底颠覆了整个世界
turned the whole thing inside out.

764
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,350
我要说的是
All I'm saying is...

765
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,340
现在是一个新的时代
it's a new era now,

766
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,090
一切都开始变得怪诞
and things are about to get really weird.

767
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,030
你要藏好你的编码
So you should keep your code close to your vest.

768
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,850
