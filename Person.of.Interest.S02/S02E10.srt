62
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,740
名叫"归国英雄之家"

63
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,830
也许是因为她弟弟

90
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,620
有条线报  匿名的
I got a tip, anonymous.

91
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,730
说他被个警察谋杀了
Said a cop killed him.

92
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,280
也许他牵扯进了HR的生意中
Well, maybe he was mixed up in some HR business.

93
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,690
也许HR的警察把他弄掉了
Maybe an HR cop took him out.

94
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,400
我听说51局之前有人清毒贩

Will you excuse us?

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,610
卡特警探  我们得谈谈
Detective Carter, we need to talk.

100
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,540
晚点聊
I'll catch up with you later.

101
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,430
HR一案现在只剩下些枝节在处理了
So, with HR degraded to the point of irrelevance,

102
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,130
所以我们的工作重心现在转移到西装男身上
my team is shifting priorities back to the man in the suit.

103
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,210
他还逍遥在外  你还想抓到他吧
He's still out there. Do you still want to catch him?

104
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,720
当然
Yes, of course.

105
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
好
Good.

106
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,150
我们有些新发现
We have some new information,

107
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,240
知道了他在为谁工作
including who he's working for.

108
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,870
局里一直在追查
Now, the Bureau has been tracking the emergence

109
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,610
私人情报网
of private intelligence networks,

110
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,330
就像中情局和军情六处那种  不过是营利性质的
like the CIA or MI6, but for profit.

111
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,070
我们认为其中最大的一个有中国背景
We think the biggest of these has Chinese backing.

112
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,870
他们有技术  有资源
They've got technology, serious resources,

113
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,570
并一直在招兵买马
and they've been buying up tant.

114
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,400
比如  我们认为马克・斯诺
For instance, we think Mark Snow,

115
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,970
那名联系你的中情局特工
the CIA agent who contacted you,

116
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,340
可能被招募了
may also have been recruited,

117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,430
可能就是被西装男招募
possibly by the man in the suit.

118
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,590
-真的吗  斯诺  -讲得通
- Really? Snow? - Makes sense.

119
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,020
斯诺被中情局派来追他
I mean, Snow was sent to find this man by the CIA.

120
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,380
他抓到了  然后西装男策反了他
He catches him, and then the man in the suit flips him.

121
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,840
把斯诺招入麾下
Gets Snow to be his asset.

卡特  我想你参与此案
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this,

but it's classified,

And I know, with your skills,

127
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,040
很快就会升为永久雇员
it'll soon become permanent.

128
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,940
你一加入  我就能让你参与此案

143
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,310
是啊  怎么样了
Yep. So, what is it?

144
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,630
我们刚刚告诉了这位詹宁斯法警
Like we were telling Marshal Jennings here--

145
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,780
詹宁斯法警啊
Marshal Jennings, huh?

146
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,720
经理报告说他的一位职员
The manager called it in 'cause one of his staff,

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,190
叫艾比・门罗的姑娘
a girl by the name of Abby Monroe,

148
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,990
非法下载了一份文件
downloaded a file illegally.

149
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,720
两小时前离开了
And walked out with it two hours ago.

150
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,070
等有人发现已经晚了
No one noticed till too late.

151
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,970
有人知道文件里是什么内容吗
Well, does anyone know what's on the file?

152
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,090
我们存了一些重要建筑物的规划
Well, we keep plans here for some important buildings,

153
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,380
不过她拿走的只是

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,220
华尔街附近汉诺威1400的工程样图
for the 1400 block of Hanover near Wall Street.

155
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,530
那里有配电站
It's got an elerical sub-station,

156
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,780
律师事务所  还有家投行总部
lawyers' offices, and the HQ of an investment bank.

157
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,130
没什么关键性基础设施目标
Nothing like a critical infrastructure target.

158
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,460
有没有人知道艾比・门罗住在哪里

159
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,360
我们查了

电话号码是投币式公用电话
The phone number is a pay phone.

162
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,330
这里的背景调查可真靠谱
Hey, solid background check there.

163
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,370
怎么说呢
What can I say?

164
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,980
她看起来是个乖巧的孩子
I mean, she seemed like a sweet kid.

165
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,530
居然是装的  真令人失望
Kind of disappointing to find she was a flake.

166
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,760
孩子嘛  说不准的  是吧警探
Kids. You never know. Right, Detective?

167
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,490
是啊
Right.

168
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,690
总之  干得不错  跟进及时
Anyway, good job, following up so quickly.

169
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,290
失陪了各位
Gentlemen.

170
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,040
谢谢你  法警
Thank you, Marshal.

171
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,920
如果有其他发现
Look, if you come up with anything else,

172
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,680
给我电话
give me a call.

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
约翰  约翰
John. John!

174
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,440
你脑子进水了吗
Are you out of your mind?

175
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,580
居然冒充执法人员
Impersonating a law enforcement officer?

176
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,430
詹宁斯法警  你拿了他的徽章
Marshal Jennings? You took his star?

177
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,430
他反正也不用了
He wasn't using it anymore.

178
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,860
很好用啊  卡特
It's great, Carter.

179
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,220
把徽章一亮  人们就知无不言了
Just flash a badge, and people tell you everything.

180
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,280
你别乱来了  约翰
You gotta stop, John.

181
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,970
唐纳利又来了  一心要抓西装男
Donnelly's back, and he's hot for the man in the suit.

182
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,650
他有了新的想法
He has a new theory.

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
是啊  我在为中国工作之类的
Yeah, that I'm working for China or something.

184
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,000
我们听到了
We heard.

185
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,100
我们还听到他的邀请了
We also heard his offer.

186
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,640
也许调到联调局对你有好处
Maybe a transfer to the FBI would be good for you.

187
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,590
你们俩监听我的全部谈话吗
Do you listen to all of my conversations?

188
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,140
多多少少吧
More or less.

189
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,150
你气色不错  卡特
You're looking nice, Carter.

190
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,630
看来这位卡尔・比彻对你也有好处
Maybe this Cal Beecher would be good for you too.

191
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,900
他对你好就行了
Long as he treats you right.

192
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,640
他敢惹你生气  我去找他算账
He messes with you, he'll be hearing from me.

193
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,720
好吧  行了  听着
Okay. All right, look.

194
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,010
我们得讨论下界线问题了
We're gonna have to set some boundaries here.

195
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,350
当然
Well, sure.

196
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,080
你和卡尔进展到"某种程度"时
Things get heavy with you and Cal,

197
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
我们会闭上眼睛不看
we'll tune out right away.

198
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,340
当我没说
Never mind.

199
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,790
艾比・门罗是怎么回事
What's the deal with Abby Monroe?

200
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,900
我想查查她是不是有麻烦了
I was checking to see she wasn't in trouble.

201
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
看来晚了一步
Looks like I'm a bit late.

202
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,860
卡特  你能不能帮我拿到那个摄像头
Carter, can you get me footage from that camera

203
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,760
两小时前的录像
from about two hours ago?

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,780
还有那个摄像头
And that camera too?

205
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,930
谢了
Thank you.

206
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,170
这是艾比
There's Abby.

207
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,960
你能否查到
Were you able to trace

208
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,010
那辆摩托车的主人  警探
the owner of the motorcycle, Detective?

209
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,770
不能  因为这辆车是
No, because it was stolen

210
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,370
四天前从皇后区一家二手车展厅被偷走的
from a second-hand showroom in Queens four days ago.

211
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,830
我从抢劫组拿到了监控录像
I got the camera tapes out of the Robbery Squad.

212
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,410
我看到有个单身男子
I see the perp is a single male.

213
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,250
你现在在看录像吗
You looking at the footage now?

214
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,290
是的  怎么了
Yes. Why?

215
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,560
随便问问
No reason.

216
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,440
用炸药引信炸开了锁
Blew the locks with det cord.

217
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,030
没理会警报
Ignored the alarms,

218
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,290
因为他清楚自己能在30秒内脱身
'cause he knew he'd be less than 30 seconds.

219
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,760
他徒手打碎了钥匙柜
He broke the key case with his bare hand.

220
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,740
选好了车
Chose his machine.

221
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,060
令人惊叹
That's impressive.

222
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,470
怎么  怎  怎么回事
What is--what-- what is going on here?

223
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,920
别告诉我你们俩还能看到我的电脑
Don't tell me you can see what's on my computer too.

224
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,400
我是怎么说界限问题来着
What did I say about setting boundaries?

225
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,220
那是假手
That's a prosthetic hand.

226
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,920
高档假体
High-end prosthetic,

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,520
用炸药引信进入
use of det cord to gain entry into a building.

228
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,530
依我看  是退役军人
My guess, ex-military.

229
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,170
所以才会跟艾比认识
Might explain his connection to Abby.

230
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,580
问题是  他们在干什么
The question is, what are they doing?

231
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,510
我想答案你不会喜欢
I don't think you're gonna like the answer.

232
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,500
调度站刚刚回应了我的车牌协查要求
Comp stat just flagged my license plate inquiry.

233
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,550
那辆摩托车
The same motorcycle was seen

234
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,930
被交通灯摄像头拍到
on a traffic light camera near a robbery

235
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,550
三天前出现在新泽西一起建筑工地抢劫中
at a construction site in New Jersey three nights ago.

236
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,550
抢走了什么
What was stolen?

237
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,170
爆炸物  塞姆汀塑性炸药
Explosives. Semtex.

238
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,520
足有九公斤  还有爆破雷管
20 pounds of it, and blasting caps.

239
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,110
这样看来  偷爆炸物
Let's see, theft of explosives,

240
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,890
偷华尔街上一栋建筑物的工程平面图
theft of engineering plans for a block on Wall Street.

241
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,540
这家伙可能是下一个蒂莫西・麦克维
This guy could be the next Timothy Mcveigh,

242
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,540
{\an8}曾在1995年的俄克拉荷马州制造过一起导致168人丧生的爆炸案

243
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,120
而那位姑娘跟他一起
and your girl is working with him.

244
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,050
他也许是拐骗她牵涉其中的
He may have manipulated her into getting involved.

245
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,590
那她也是牵涉其中了
She's still involved.

246
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,540
抱歉  我得履行我的职责
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to do my job.

247
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,340
我得对她发布全境通告
I'm gonna have to put her name out on an APB.

248
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,580
我们得先找到她
We've got to find her first.

249
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,060
奥尔森  你在55局工作过
Hey, Olson, you worked at the 55.

250
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,390
你认不认识一个叫卡尔・比彻的缉毒警探
You know a narco detective named Cal Beecher?

251
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,340
当然认识
Oh, yeah, sure do.

252
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,480
我们以前都叫他纯金卡尔
We used to call him 18-karat Cal.

253
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,650
衣服好  车子好
Better suits, better cars,

254
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,020
女友好  全都好过我们
better girls than the rest of us.

255
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,580
也许他只是品味好
Maybe he just had better taste.

256
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,100
也许他是受贿
Or maybe he was on the take.

257
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,270
你听我说过吗
Did you hear me say that?

258
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,670
不知道  你说什么了
Don't know. What are you saying?

259
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,460
他曾是卧底缉毒警
Look, he was undercover narcotics.

260
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,700
毒品进进出出  大笔钱来来回回
A lot of buy-and-busts, a lot of money hanging around.

261
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,190
不过  你打听这个干嘛
Anyway, why you want to know?

262
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,060
就是最近老见着他
I just been seeing him around.

263
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,530
是啊  他在和卡特警探约会
Yeah. He's been hanging around Detective Carter.

264
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,620
人家会招蜂引蝶啊  弗斯科
Bees like honey, Fusco.

265
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,150
是啊
Yeah.

266
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
我只是说  像艾比这样
I'm just saying, but the way Abby

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,460
奋不顾身  舍弃一切
went off the grid, cut all ties,

268
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,470
她肯定计划着什么  芬奇
she's planning something, Finch.

269
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,120
你觉得这位优秀学生想要炸掉华尔街吗
You think our honor student wants to blow up Wall Street?

270
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,130
可能她男朋友想
Well, her boyfriend might.

271
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,430
他可不是第一个走极端的退伍士兵
He isn't the first vet to try something extreme.

272
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,910
我们这种人本来就古怪  芬奇
We are an odd bunch, Finch.

273
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,850
你是挺古怪  里瑟先生  而且你错了
You are odd, Mr. Reese. You're also wrong.

274
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,820
如果艾比牵涉的是境内恐怖主义
If Abby were involved with domestic terrorism,

275
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,190
这属于相关信息
which would be a relevant crime,

276
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,010
机器会把她的号码给到
the machine would have given her number to--

277
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,320
给到现在政府中负责此事之人
to whoever now runs that end of things at the government,

278
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,100
而不会给到我们
not to us.

279
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,290
无论她是威胁的目标  还是威胁的来源
Whether she's the target or the source of the threat,

280
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,730
原因肯定是私人性质的
the issues must be personal.

281
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,260
好吧  那我们还有什么线索  芬奇
Fine, but what leads do we have left, Finch?

282
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,950
有两条
We have two.

283
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,890
第一  她给短期工中介的投币式公用电话号码
First, the pay phone number that she gave the temp agency.

284
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,440
在皇后区的一个街角
It's a street corner in Queens.

285
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,200
中介之前肯定
The agency must have been able

286
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,750
通过那个电话联系过她
to contact her there at one point.

287
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,490
也许可以找到她住所的线索
It might give you a clue as to where she's living.

288
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,020
好  那第二条呢
Okay. And the second lead?

289
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,340
她去年工作的那个地方
The one stable point in her life for the last year--

290
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,740
那个慈善组织  "归国英雄之家"
the charity, Homes For Our Returning Heroes.

291
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,600
我去查这个
I'll check that one out.

292
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,750
好啊  你应该多出门走动
Good. You need to get out more.

293
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,810
你心情可真好  里瑟先生
You're in a good mood, Mr. Reese.

294
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,310
是好
I am.

295
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,990
我早上一觉醒来  感觉
I woke up this morning and felt--

296
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,660
我斟酌再三才能把这话说出来  我感觉很幸福
it took me a while to put my finger on it, but I felt happy.

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,920
肯定是因为这份工作
Must be this job.

298
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,430
我很开心
Well, I'm glad.

299
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,360
抱歉  小熊  这次不行
Sorry, Bear. Not now.

300
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,450
艾比接入了这个公用电话
Abby tapped into that pay phone.

301
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,830
{\pos(205,152)}维多利亚公寓

302
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,830
{\pos(206,199)}日租  周租  月租

303
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,520
我想我找到
I think I've found

304
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,440
这对雌雄大盗之前的藏身之处了
where our Bonnie and Clyde have been laying low.

305
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,330
乔什・门罗  艾比的弟弟
Josh Monroe, Abby's little brother.

306
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,450
我是艾比家的老朋友
I'm an old friend of Abby's family,

307
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,260
我来纽约
and as I was visiting New York,

308
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,410
他们拜托我找找艾比住在哪里
they asked if I'd try to find out where Abby is

309
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,200
为什么要辞职
and why she left her job here.

310
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,560
她没告诉家里吗
She never told them?

311
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,570
抱歉  但我不得不解雇她
Well, I'm sorry, but I had to fire her.

312
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,150
-解雇她  到底为什么呢  -偷东西
- Fire her? What on earth for? - Stealing.

313
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,690
一开始  只是些现金  我就没多追究
At first, it was just petty cash, and I let it go,

314
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,840
以为只是粗心大意  但后来我发现
thinking it was simple carelessness, but then I found

315
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,100
她偷偷潜入我们慈善组织的账户
she was sneaking into the Charity's accounts,

316
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,550
想转钱出去  一大笔钱
trying to move money around-- significant amounts.

317
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,920
查普先生
Mr. Chapple,

318
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,620
这不像我认识的艾比
that really doesn't sound like the Abby I know.

319
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,880
很遗憾  这是事实
Well, unfortunately, it's true.

320
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,630
我们向有经济困难的退伍士兵发放低息贷款
We give low-cost loans to veterans in financial trouble.

321
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,970
有一点点丑闻
Any hint of a scandal,

322
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,640
捐款者就会抽身走人
and our donations would just dry right up.

323
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,690
艾比必须走人
Abby had to go.

324
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,240
妈  爸
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

325
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,820
要是你们看到这个  就说明我现在有麻烦了
If you're watching this, you'll know I'm in trouble.

326
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,050
你们上次对我发火  还是在我八岁的时候
I don't think you've really been mad at me since I was eight,

327
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,450
那时我把乔什绑在滑板上
that time I tied Josh to his skateboard

328
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,350
把他从山上推下滑到我们家门口
and pushed him down the hill in front of our house

329
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,640
想看他能有多快
to see how fast he would go.

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,010
那以后  我一直都很乖  循规蹈矩
Since then, I've always tried to be good, keep the rules.

331
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,110
这次我要干件彻底逆转的大事
Now I'm gonna break them in a big way.

332
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,010
为什么  原因既复杂  也简单
Why? Well, it's complicated and it's simple.

333
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,110
因为我在做正确的事
I'm doing it because it's right,

334
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,630
我知道乔什也会同意的
and I know Josh would agree with me.

335
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,780
他是我弟弟  但我一直敬佩他
He was my little brother, but I always looked up to him,

336
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,450
我知道他会为我骄傲的
and I know that he would be proud of me,

337
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,630
我希望你们了解真相后也会如此
just like I hope you are when you know the truth.

338
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,900
我爱你们  真希望你们不用看到这个
I love you, and I hope you never have to see this.

339
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,090
知道她为什么要偷东西吗
Any idea why she started stealing?

340
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,860
应该是在她认识某个退役的海军陆战队员之后
I believe the trouble started when she met a former marine.

341
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,550
他来公司时他们俩聊过
They'd talk when he came by the offices.

342
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,580
他不知怎么的  反正对艾比影响很大
Somehow, he must have made an impression on Abby,

343
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,380
因为从那以后她就开始偷东西了
'cause, just about that time, she started stealing.

344
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,210
我不明白  陆战队员怎么会来这呢
I don't understand. Why did this marine come here?

345
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,220
不好意思
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,190
我们与贷款用户签有
We have a strict confidentiality agreement

347
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,570
严格的保密协议
with all of our loan recipients.

348
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,420
简而言之  不是很愉快
Suffice it to say, it was not a pleasant visit.

349
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,830
至少告诉我他叫什么
Could you at least tell me his name?

350
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,340
尚恩・科尔曼下士
Corporal Shayn Coleman,

351
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
爆炸物处理专家
explosives ordinance disposal expert.

352
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,010
他的右臂三年前
Lost his right arm

353
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,780
在阿富汗拆除简易爆炸装置时失去了
defusing an IED in Afghanistan three years ago.

354
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,640
他就是偷摩托车的人
He's our motorcycle thief.

355
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,240
我查了尚恩在俄亥俄老家的父母
I tracked down Shayn's parents in his hometown in Ohio.

356
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,030
他们两个多月没见到他了
They haven't seen him in more than two months.

357
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,410
他们知道他有麻烦了吗
Did they know he was in trouble?

358
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,390
他们说他房子的赎回权被取消了
They said he'd had his home foreclosed on,

359
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,940
他未婚妻甩了她
and his fiancee dumped him.

360
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,700
他肯定是为此去找查普的
Must be why he went to Chapple--

361
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,510
希望能再次贷款
to ask for another loan.

362
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,240
不知道发生了什么事  反正是足以
However it happened, this is more than enough

363
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,820
把人推向不归路了
to tip someone over the edge.

364
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,990
他是我们要找的人  我得对他发布全境通告
He's our guy. I'm adding his name to the APB.

365
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,430
做你该做的吧  警探
Do what you have to do, Detective.

366
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,060
芬奇  你还在吗
Finch, are you still there?

367
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,620
是的
Yes.

368
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,370
我看到菲利普・查普在和两个携带武器的人碰面
I'm watching Philip Chapple meet with two armed men.

369
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,650
他们什么样
What are they like?

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,340
坦白说  像你  低调而危险
Like you, to be honest-- low-key and vaguely menacing.

371
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,340
我估计他是在告诉他们追踪
I suspect he's telling them to follow me

372
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,230
我身上的GPS发射器信号
via the GPS transponder

373
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,450
我离开时他放进我口袋里的
he slipped into my pocket as I was leaving.

374
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,530
那发射器现在何处呢
And where is the transponder now?

375
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,150
在一辆新泽西牌照的洗衣车上
It's on a laundry van with Jersey plates.

376
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,800
干得漂亮  芬奇
Nice work, Finch.

377
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,120
很明显  查普不会放过追踪艾比的任何机会
Obviously, Chapple will take any opportunity to track Abby down.

378
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,020
她的计划肯定与他有关
What she's planning must connect to him too.

379
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,840
等慈善组织关门后  我再潜进去
When the charity closes, I'll go back in,

380
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,880
看看能发现什么
see what I can find.

381
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,730
我说你该多出门走动
When I said you need to get out more,

382
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,510
可不是这个意思
I didn't mean that.

383
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,040
我去搞定
Let me take care of it.

384
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,990
没有无风险的人生  里瑟先生
No such thing as a risk-free life, Mr. Reese,

385
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,730
艾比是我们的当务之急
and Abby is still our priority.

386
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,450
你在那等她
You wait for her.

387
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,270
我回去
So, I'll go back in,

388
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,840
看看查普究竟在隐藏什么
see what exactly Chapple's hiding.

389
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,820
我进来了
I'm inside,

390
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,710
不过报警装置已经被破坏了
but the alarm has been tampered with.

391
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,130
可能是人家已经在恭候你了  哈罗德
That's because they could be waiting for you, Harold.

392
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,320
怎么了  芬奇  快离开
What was that? Finch, get out now.

393
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,510
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

394
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,640
我是谁并不重要  科尔曼先生
Who I am is not important, Mr. Coleman.

395
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,150
你怎么知道我的名字  你在这做什么
How do you know my name? What are you doing here?

396
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,820
我估计是和你一样
The same thing as you, I expect,

397
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,240
不过你已经惊动了全楼
and since you woke the whole building,

398
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,290
我们得快点了
we better hurry.

399
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,170
我去找你
I'm on my way to you.

400
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,600
拜托  只管离开  芬奇
Please, just walk away now, Finch.

401
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,160
你是谁
Who are you?

402
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,120
放开我
let go of me!

403
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,560
别害怕  我不会伤害你的
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

404
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,620
芬奇  马上离开
Finch, get out now.

405
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,410
别冒险  我找到艾比了
Don't risk it. I've got Abby.

406
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,230
赶紧离开
Just get out of there.

407
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,870
马上就好  里瑟先生
Nearly done, Mr. Reese.

408
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,550
拜托别这样
Please don't do that.

409
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,390
那就放开我  让我走
Then get off of me. Let me go.

410
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,810
拜托  别动枪
Please, no guns.

411
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,040
芬奇  说话  怎么了
Finch, talk to me. What's happening?

412
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,350
事态有变  里瑟先生
The situation is evolving, Mr. Reese.

413
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,300
他们在那儿
There they go!

414
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
站住
Stop right there!

415
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,260
上来  他们会杀了你
Get on, or they'll kill you!

416
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,970
上来
Get on!

417
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,140
芬奇  你没事吧
Finch, are you okay?

418
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,080
除了非法搭乘摩托车外  我还好
Aside from riding on a motorcycle illegally, I'm fine!

419
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,860
保持联系
I'll be in touch!

420
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,510
干得漂亮
Well done.

421
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,510
你好  艾比
Hello, Abby.

422
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,500
我叫约翰
I'm John.

423
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,880
好了  你该离开了
Okay, you should leave now,

424
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,980
我男朋友随时会回来
because my boyfriend's gonna be here any minute.

425
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,900
你男朋友  尚恩
Your boyfriend, Shayn?

426
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,370
我不知道你怎么知道的  不过没错
I don't know how you know that, but yes,

427
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,590
他是陆战队员  你可不会想见他
and he's a marine, so you do not want to meet him.

428
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,270
实际上  我正想见他
Actually, I do want to meet him,

429
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,540
不过一件件来
But first things first.

430
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,610
你留给你父母的视频是什么意思
What does that message to your mom and dad mean?

431
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,510
什么
What?

432
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,020
你闯进我家翻了我的东西
You broke into my room and went through my stuff?

433
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,620
出去  否则我
Get out, or I'm--

434
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,160
怎么  你要报警吗
What? You'll call the police?

435
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,900
我知道建筑设计图和爆炸物的事
I know about the building plans and the explosives.

436
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,220
我就知道  你是查普的人
I knew it. You work for Chapple.

437
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,420
不  不过我很好奇为什么你和尚恩
No, but I'm interested to know why you and Shayn

438
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,330
要追查他
are going after him.

439
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,290
因为查普是个骗子  盗贼
Because Chapple's a liar and a thief,

440
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,140
我不会再多说一句话了
and I'm not saying another word

441
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,670
除非你告诉我你是谁
until you tell me who you are.

442
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,630
我是来阻止你陷入更多麻烦的人
I'm here to stop you from getting into even more trouble.

443
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,110
我问的不是这个
Not what I asked.

444
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,370
你是谁
Who are you?

445
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,510
这有点难回答
I find it hard to answer that,

446
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,020
我自己也说不好
even to myself.

447
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,640
我当过兵  和你弟弟乔什一样
I was a soldier once, like your brother Josh.

448
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,970
不过我很幸运  活着回来了
But I was lucky. I made it out.

449
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,950
-里瑟先生  -在  芬奇  怎么了
- Mr. Reese? - Yes, Finch. What's happening?

450
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,830
我跟尚恩说我们是想帮助他
I've explained to Shayn that we're trying to help him.

451
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,090
他相信你了吗
Did he believe you?

452
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,760
没有  尤其是我告诉他你抓了艾比后
No, especially when I told him that you have Abby.

453
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,220
形势有点紧张
Things are a little tense.

454
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,730
让我跟他说
Let me talk to him.

455
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,260
你是谁
Who is this?

456
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,820
艾比也在问我同样的问题
You know, Abby keeps asking me the same thing.

457
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,340
这真的不重要
It's really not important.

458
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,570
敢伤害她  你会后悔的
If you hurt her, you will be sorry.

459
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,970
你那边也是一样
The same goes for you and my friend.

460
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,190
我们该见见
We should meet.

461
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,050
你跟尚恩离开  我就没法保护你了
Once you leave with Shayn, I can't protect you anymore.

462
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,610
我一开始就没要你保护
I never asked you to protect me in the first place.

463
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,130
不管你在计划什么  我知道原因  艾比
Whatever you're planning, I know why, Abby.

464
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,650
你没能救你弟弟
You couldn't save your brother,

465
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,440
所以想要救尚恩
so you're trying to save Shayn.

466
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,830
我理解  真的
I understand that, truly.

467
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,040
我有切身感受
I'd feel the same way.

468
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,040
告诉我  查普怎么你了
Tell me, what did Chapple do to you?

469
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,600
对我没什么  可他几乎毁了尚恩
Nothing I can't handle, but he nearly destroyed Shayn.

470
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,790
-贷款的事  -对
- By lending him money? - Yes.

471
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,530
查普贷款给他
Chapple made him a loan.

472
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,690
利息一年滚了三倍
The interest rates tripled in a year.

473
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,870
没人能付得起
No one could keep up those payments.

474
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,110
失去房子的人成百上千万
Millions of people lost their homes.

475
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,710
人家也没去偷爆炸物
They don't go around stealing explosives.

476
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,210
尚恩得放手
Shayn should move on.

477
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,890
他失去了房子  失去了未婚妻
He lost his home and his fiancee.

478
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,700
他还曾把自己的朋友介绍给查普
He even introduced some of his buddies to Chapple,

479
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,540
结果其中一个饮弹自尽
one of whom shot himself

480
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,740
就在失去的房子门口
on the porch of the house he no longer owned.

481
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,720
让他这么放手不理吗
Should he move on from that?

482
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,270
我查过查普的文件
Look, I went through Chapple's files.

483
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,720
发现了他的所作所为
I saw what he was doing.

484
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,350
有成百上千
There are hundreds,

485

成百上千的士兵失去了家园
hundreds of soldiers who lost their homes.

486
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,690
你想要做什么  艾比
What are you gonna do, Abby?

487
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,170
做正确的事
The right thing.

488
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,210
我能走了吗
Can I go now?

489
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,180
我猜你给他放追踪器了吧
I assume you put a tracker on him.

490
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,040
恕我自夸  远不止此
Rather a clever one, if I do say so myself.

491
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,040
他的假肢由肌电感应器控制
His prosthetic arm is controlled by myoelectric sensors

492
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,320

by way of a wireless link,

493
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,670
我复制了连接  二次编程
so I cloned the link and reprogrammed it

494
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,110
路过任何手机都会强制配对

而且是在狂飚的摩托车后座上完成的
Especially on the back of a speeding motorcycle,

498
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,010
对了  感觉好刺激
which was exhilarating, by the way.

499
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,080
我想自己也弄一辆
I might have to get myself one.

500

What, I got competition? From that guy?

506
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,500
不  不是那种邀请
No, not that sort of offer.

507
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,360

508
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,060

虽说宁为鸡头不为凤尾

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,730
那片儿地方太大
It's a big area to cover.

608
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,460
不计成本  必须搞定
Whatever you need. Just finish it.

609
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,100
卡特  你得马上过来
Carter, I need to see you immediately.

610
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,870
能把手机交出来吗
Can I have your phone?

611
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,320
怎么了  唐纳利
What's going on, Donnelly?

612
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,630
抱歉  不过我认为此人所服务的组织
I'm sorry, but I think the organization our man works for

613
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,080
掌握颇多先进科技
has some sophisticated capabilities.

614
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,170
比如窃听警方电话
Like wire-tapping cops?

615
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,630
怎么回事
Has something happened?

616
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,900
我想我们有突破了
I think we got our break.

617
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,060
西装男参与了一桩上东区
The man in the suit was involved in a robbery at a charity

618
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,220
慈善组织抢劫案
on the upper east side.

619
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,520
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

620
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,800
在我告诉你之前  我必须确定
Now, before I can let you in, I have to know

621
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,250
你是否接受局里的临时雇员职位
if you'll accept the temporary assignment to the Bureau.

622
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,120
好  我接受
Okay, yes.

623
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,180
好  你不会后悔的
Good. You won't regret it.

624
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,280
我们追踪此人有十个月了
So, we've been tracking this man for ten months.

625
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,560
每次我们一靠近
Every time we get close,

626
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,060
他都能从我们眼皮底下溜走
he slips right out from under us,

627
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,170
就好像有守护天使一样
as if he has some guardian angel.

628
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,940
之后我就全力搜寻线索  任何线索
All I've looked for since then is a lead, any lead,

629
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,670
后来我意识到了  电话
and then I realized, the phone.

630
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,920
他和他的联络员一直保持着通讯
He's in constant communication with his handlers.

631
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,010
我也想到过
I thought of that.

632
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,050
交叉对比了他所到的犯罪现场周边
Cross-checked crime scenes he was reported at

633
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,100
手机基站日志中的手机串号
with cell tower logs of IMEIs.

634
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,770
-一无所获  -对  一无所获
- Came up with nothing. - Exactly. Nothing.

635
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,740
匡提科的工程师分析了他从下城区
Our engineers at Quantico analyzed the cell tower traffic

636
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,750
溜走那晚的手机基站通信数据
from that night he gave us the slip downtown.

637
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,000
在无线网络和收音机噪音之下
Under the wireless and radio noise,

638
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,720
他们发现了一个有独特标识的
they found short bursts of a cloned IMEI

639
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,390
复制手机串号的短波信号
with a unique signature.

640
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,870
我分配了联调局的机群搜寻该信号
I tasked an FBI computer cluster to search for that signature.

641
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,130
24小时前  机群上线
24 hours ago, the cluster came online.

642
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,690
它发现了另一个复制手机串号的信号
It spotted another burst of cloned IMEIs

643
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,330
与抢劫案的时间地点完全吻合
at the exact time and location of the robbery.

644
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,830
是他
It's him.

645
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,710
我已经让特警队待命了
I've got SWAT teams standing by.

646
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,180
只要他用那个电话  我们就能逮住他
If he uses that phone, we'll have him.

647
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,640
艾比  你做得够多了
Abby, this is far enough.

648
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,050
下面我来吧
I'll handle this from here.

649
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,410
回公寓等我
I'll meet you back at the apartment.

650
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,010
不  要么一起  要么不做
No. No, together or nothing.

651
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,710
你已经冒了太多险  艾比
You've risked enough, Abby.

652
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
这不是你的战争
This isn't your fight right now.

653
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,420
这就是我的战争  你就是我的战争
This is my fight. You're my fight.

654
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,260
要我就不会这么做
I wouldn't do that.

655
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,230
或这么做
Or that.

656
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,140
说实话
Now, the truth...

657
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,320
不然我亲手把你们交给警察
or I take you to the cops myself.

658
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,600
我知道你们是来这儿偷查普的钱
I know you're here to steal Chapple's money.

659
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,810
偷完以后呢
What then?

660
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,940
我们想把钱还给被偷的人
We want to give it back to the people he stole it from.

661
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,230
怎么还
How?

662
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,430
我们还没想到那么远
We haven't thought that far ahead.

663
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,620
你们根本就没想远过
You haven't thought very far at all.

664
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,800
为什么不找警察或者律师
Now, why not go to the cops or a lawyer?

665
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,680
艾比找了
Abby did.

666
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,100
她去找地检官  可查普抢先一步
She went to the DA, but Chapple got there first,

667
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,400
打点了那里
spread his poison.

668
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,230
地检甚至威胁要起诉她
The DA even threatened to prosecute her

669
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,760
盗窃和诽谤
for theft and slander.

670
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,960
等我回到公寓
When I got to my apartment,

671
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,070
查普的打手就等在那里
one of Chapple's mercenaries was there.

672
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,570
他打了我
He beat me up.

673
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,090
说我如果我再多说一个字
He said if I said another word,

674
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,460
他会回来用枪打爆我的头
he would come back and put a bullet in my head.

675
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,070
穿过这里就是银行了吧
I assume the bank's through there?

676
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,020
炸了这堵墙  我们就到银行底下了
We blow that wall, we're underneath it.

677
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,990
约翰  这太过分了
John, this has gone far enough.

678
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,950
是吗  芬奇
Has it, Finch?

679
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,520
是的  阻止他们  我来搞定查普
Yes. Stop them. I can deal with Chapple.

680
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,100
查普伤了他们  芬奇
Chapple hurt them, Finch.

681
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,410
他们试过走法律途径  可是没用
They tried the law. The law wasn't interested.

682
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,260
他们还有什么办法呢
What have they got left?

683
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,950
再说了  我向来对那些
Besides, I've always had a thing

684
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,080
坑退伍士兵的人颇有意见
about people who screw with veterans.

685
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,570
约翰  这太冒险了
John, it's far too risky.

686
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,070
你说什么来着  哈罗德
What did you say, Harold?

687
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,430
没有无风险的人生
No such thing as a risk-free life.

688
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,260
动手吧
Let's do it.

689
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,690
等地铁通过
Wait for the subway.

690
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,020
现在
Now.

691
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,440
这就是保险箱的位置
This is where the safe deposit boxes are.

692
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,660
我们意识到无法从银行里面接近它
We realized we couldn't get to them from inside the bank,

693
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,340
所以我们决定让它来接近我们
so we decided to bring them to us.

694
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,640
你们要炸房顶
You're gonna blow the roof.

695
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,690
这儿有情况
We got something here.

696
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,910
约翰  你那边如何
John, what's your situation?

697
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,390
再给我十分钟
Ten more minutes.

698
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,590
我发现了个情况
I'm seeing what I can only describe

699
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,750
我们的电话连线有干扰
as interference on our phone link.

700
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,280
是根吗
Is it Root?

701
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,050
不是  是广谱扫描
No, it's a broad spectrum sweep,

702
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,780
出自重型计算机
heavy-duty computer power.

703
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,800
根要精致得多
Root's more subtle than that.

704
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,500
一定是联调局的朋友
It must be our FBI friend.

705
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,030
马上下线  立刻出来
Stay off the line and please get out now.

706
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,320
如果尚恩和艾比不出来  抛下他们
If Shayn and Abby won't come, leave them.

707
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,910
我不抛下别人
I don't leave people,

708
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
他们在打击坏蛋
and they're bringing down a very bad man.

709
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,290
你的实验不就是为这个吗
Now, isn't that what your experiment's all about?

710
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,330
我的实验是为了救人命
My experiment is about stopping people from getting killed,

711
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,610
不是为了抢银行
not robbing banks.

712
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,230
五分钟后我们就出来
Five minutes and we're out.

713

717
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,730

718
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,470
这里有三千多万美金
There's more than $30 million here.

719
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,780
他的慈善组织偷了三千万美金

720
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,720
走吧  原路返回
Then let's go, back the way we came.

721
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,190
趴下
Get down!

722
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,520
-你还好吗  -现世报啊
- You okay? - Karma at last.

723
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,780
这些凶徒都是查普雇的  是吧
It's those thugs Chapple hired, isn't it?

724
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,490
银行还有三十分钟开门
The bank opens in 30 minutes.

725
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,120
我们必须在那之前离开
We've got to get out before then.

726
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,260

华尔街附近地下疑似爆炸

告诉哈罗德  唐纳利正要前往华尔街

好的  妈  多谢  我爱你

740
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,370
你家神奇小子在哪儿都好  最好不在华尔街
Wherever Wonder Boy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street,

741
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,810
因为唐纳利正要过去
because that's where Donnelly's heading.

742
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,190
约翰就在那里

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,860
你们的手机问题
about him being up on your phones.

746
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,120
果然如我所虑
Just as I feared.

747
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,360
尽量帮我们在银行制造干扰

这点可能对我们有利
Seems like something that might be to our advantage.

753
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,230
反击以利亚吗
To hit back at Elias?

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,760
组建另一个收入来源
