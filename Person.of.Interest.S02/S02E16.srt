00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,840
他绕了一小时圈子了  科尔
He's been walking in circles for an hour, Cole.

166
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,880
我有点无聊了
I'm getting a little bored.

167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,980
给我讲讲故事吧
Tell me a story.

168
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,780
詹姆斯・梅瑟
James Mercer.

169
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,680
在特种部队服役过四年
Did four in the corps.

170
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,900
后来被开除军籍
A dishonorable discharge.

171
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,890
投身民兵运动
Graduates to the militia movement.

172
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,420
一周前
And then a week ago,

173
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,420
一个海外账户给他电汇了一万
he gets wired 10k from an offshore account,

174
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,440
他搬去了皇后区
and moves to Queens.

175
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,850
我猜探索者认为他不是
I'm guessing research doesn't think he's here

176
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,880
来看百老汇的
for a Broadway show.

177
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,000
科尔  我可能暴露了
Cole, I think I've been made.

178
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,200
九点方向  西装帅哥
9:00, good-looking guy in a suit.

179
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,940
你确定他不是在欣赏你吗
You sure he's not just checking you out?

180
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,380
你可忘带防毒面具了  肖
Forgot your gas mask, Shaw.

181
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,300
好吧  虚惊一场
All right, false alarm.

182
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,130
有电话
Incoming.

183
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,400
梅瑟接到一个电话
Mercer's getting a call.

184
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,860
时间到  明天就是大日子
It's time. Tomorrow's the big day.

185
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,890
我们得看看这家伙的电脑  今晚
We need to get a look at this guy's computer tonight.

186
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
你可能得出来走走了
You may even have to get out of the van.

187
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,330
你有问题吗
Is something wrong with you?

188
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,620
你不是还在为那位斯陶德姑娘朝思暮想吧
You're not still pining for that girl in STAAD.

189
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,460
你不好奇探索者是从哪里得到号码的吗
You ever wonder where research gets the numbers?

190
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,030
-不  -为什么
- No. - Why?

191
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,820
因为我并不是为探索者工作
Because I don't work for research.

192
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,520
你有想过他们可能会犯错吗
Did you ever think they could be wrong sometimes?

193
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,590
就像圣何塞的那个家伙  阿基诺
Like that guy in San Jose. Aquino.

194
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,760
两年前
Two years ago.

195
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,440
他是那么的  困惑
He was... so confused.

196
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,480
-你还记得他怎么说吗  -记得
- You remember what he said? - I do.

197
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,460
因为
Because...

198
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,650
当时是我下手杀的他
I'm the one that killed him

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,700
而你只是通过摄像头看着
while you just watched on your little camera.

200
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,980
我还记得
I also remember...

201
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,840
他试图把核离心机的设计
that he was trying to sell designs

202
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,950
卖给黎巴嫩真主党
for a nuclear centrifuge to Hezbollah.

203
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,590
你查到了资金
And you tracked the money trail.

204
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,260
探索者对阿基诺的看法是对的
Research was right about Aquino.

205
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,400
他们永远都是对的
Like they're always right.

206
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,080
你怎么敢肯定他们永远都是对的
How can you be so sure that they are never wrong

207
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,940
你连他们是谁都不知道
if you have no idea who they even are...

208
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
也不知道他们从哪里得到的号码
or where they get these numbers?

209
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,990
我很清楚他们从哪里得到这些号码  科尔
I know exactly where they get those damn numbers from, Cole,

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,060
你也心知肚明
and so do you.

211
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,180
从他们对人严刑施虐的小黑屋里
From a dark room somewhere where they hurt people badly.

212
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,900
我们从不问探索者的号码从何而来
And the reason we don't ask where research gets its numbers from

213
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,870
是因为探索者从不出错
is because research is never wrong.

214
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,630
这次就错了
Well, they were this time.

215
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,040
你干蠢事了  是吧
You did something stupid, didn't you?

216
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,020
我给局里一个朋友打了电话
I called on one of my friends from the agency,

217
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,300
让她追踪资金
asked her to trace the money.

218
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,380
资金来源不是黎巴嫩真主党
Those transfers didn't come from Hezbollah.

219
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,270
是来自于美国政府
They came from the US government.

220
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,680
阿基诺是在做保密工作
Aquino was doing something covert,

221
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,200
但他是为了我们
but he was doing it for us.

222
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,560
我打了电话给主控者  威尔森
I called Control, Wilson.

223
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,160
我要求内部调查
I mean, I've requested an internal investigation.

224
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,040
我不会把你牵扯进来的  我保证
I will keep you out of it, I promise.

225
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,040
你对威尔森说了
You talked to Wilson?

226
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,460
是
Yeah.

227
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,370
梅瑟行动了
Mercer's on the move.

228
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,270
我们还有活儿要干
And we still have a job to do...

229
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,390
记得吗
remember?

230
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,740
好了  我进去了
All right. I'm in.

231
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,410
太简单了
That was easy.

232
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,890
有发现吗
Anything?

233
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,090
这不对劲
This is not right.

234
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,450
梅瑟跟一些联系人有邮件往来
Mercer's got a bunch of emails from some contacts--

235
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,010
都是退役军人
ex-military.

236
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,800
有那些联系人的名字吗
Do you have the name of the contacts?

237
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,390
有
Yeah.

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,490
是我们
They're us.

239
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,580
这些文件全是我们的名字
Our names are all over these files.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
{\pos(193,180}这是陷阱  快跑

241
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,710
肖  肖
Shaw? Shaw!

242
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,700
我们得离开  快
We need to move. Now.

243
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,430
有点难了
That's gonna be tough.

244
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,150
好了  来
All right, come on.

245
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,110
-抱歉  -不不不  别说话
- I'm sorry. - No, no, no, don't talk.

246
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,340
好了
All right.

247
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,950
我要打电话给主控者
Look, I'm gonna call Control, and, uh...

248
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,140
我们会救你
we're gonna get you some help.

249
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
我是想保护你
I was trying to get your back.

250
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,970
你一直想当英雄啊
Always trying to be the hero, huh?

251
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,630
不
No.

252
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,990
只当你的
Just yours.

253
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
二队  进去
Second team, head in.

254
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,240
肖
Shaw...

255
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,860
听着  我叫约翰
Listen. My name is John.

256
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,990
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

257
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,370
三队  就位
Team three, move into position.

258
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,200
这里是二队  她好像有支援
This is team two. I think she may have backup.

259
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,680
还有一个人
There's some other guy in he--

260
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,090
所有小队报告  有没有杀掉那个女人
All teams, check in. Did you kill the woman or not?

261
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,180
威尔森
Wilson?

262
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,760
怎么样
Yes?

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,240
碰上点麻烦
We got a problem.

264
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,490
她跑了
I lost her.

265
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,550
我可不认为这只是点麻烦  威尔森
I would say that's a little more than a problem, Wilson.

266
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,320
我们搞定了科尔
We took care of Cole.

267
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,210
肖开枪逃跑了
Shaw managed to shoot her way out.

268
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,920
我损失了一个小队  场面有点难看
I lost a full team. It's a bit of a mess.

269
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,260
那真是  不幸
That's...unfortunate.

270
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,440
等一下
Just a moment.

271
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,790
这是您十点国务会议时要用的全部资料
That's everything you need for your 10:00 AM with state.

272
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,920
您还有别的需要吗
Will you need anything else?

273
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,700
没了  谢谢你  梅女士
No, thank you, Miss May.

274
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,070
祝你晚上愉快
Have a nice evening.

275
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,150
您也是  先生
You too, Sir.

276
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,720
那你的意思是
So you're telling me

277
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,310
那位危险的特工已经逃脱
we've got a lethal operative off the leash

278
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,770
她知道是我们杀了她的搭档
who's aware we terminated her partner

279
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,790
还想杀她
and tried to do the same to her

280
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,130
她还掌握了一些情况
and who may have information

281
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,630
足以危害到我们整个项目
which endangers our entire project.

282
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,430
情况就是这样  先生
That seems to be the situation, Sir.

283
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,430
首先  她要找地方休整
First, she'll be looking to regroup.

284
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,440
交通工具  武器  藏匿地点
Transportation, weapons, a place to hide.

285
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,430
但我们有一项优势
But we may have an edge.

286
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,390
什么优势
What's that?

287
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,240
我肯定射伤她了
I'm pretty sure I clipped her.

288
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,630
今晚想要什么  小妞
What you need tonight, girl?

289
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,220
我只需要一点光明
You know, I just need a little bit of daylight.

290
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,830
阳光[毒品俚语]
Sunshine.

291
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,940
明白
I got you.

292
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,460
等等
Hold on!

293
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,990
路易斯
Lewis?

294
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,950
你个傻冒跑这儿来
If your dumb ass is here,

295
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,100
那谁站街角啊
who the hell is out on the corner?

296
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,300
你跟鱼比过瞪眼睛吗
You ever have a staring contest with a fish?

297
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,800
什么
What?

298
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,030
鱼没有眼皮
No eyelids.

299
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,760
再努力也没用  对吧
Kinda pointless, right?

300
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,110
就像你想去拿那把猎枪一样
Like you reaching for that scattergun.

301
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,110
退后
Back up.

302
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,150
好的  来  路易斯
Okay, there, Lewis.

303
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,830
把你的朋友绑到暖气片上去
I'm gonna need you to ziptie your friend to the radiator.

304
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,070
绑紧了
Nice and tight.

305
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,620
路易斯  我需要一些东西
Lewis, I'm gonna need some things.

306
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,510
止痛药  剃须刀片
Painkillers, razor blades,

307
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,680
如果有没纱布  那就拿毛巾来
and if... there's no gauze, then towels.

308
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,540
空心弹
Hollow point.

309
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,220
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

310
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,120
我看过这样的枪伤
Seen shots like that before.

311
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,860
一旦打进内脏
You're gut shot.

312
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,180
你就完了
You're done.

313
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,980
你最好希望不会
You better hope not,

314
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,010
因为如果我开始失去意识
'cause if I start to lose consciousness,

315
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,930
我会先打死你
I'm shooting you first.

316
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,550
坐下  路易斯
Sit down, Lewis.

317
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,290
你以前做过吗
Have you done this before?

318
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,390
你很熟练
You're pretty good at it.

319
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,980
我曾经在医学院待过一阵
I was in med school for a bit.

320
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,760
你是医生
You're a doctor?

321
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,330
不是
No.

322
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,730
加入了海军陆战队
Joined the marines.

323
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,820
原来我更擅长杀人
Figured I was better at killing people

324
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,040
而非治人
than fixing them.

325
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,170
我马上就要失去意识了
I'm about to lose consciousness,

326
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,680
所以
so, uh...

327
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,300
我要你把自己和你朋友绑在一起  好吗
I need you to ziptie yourself along with your friend, okay?

328
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,910
我就知道你是个傻瓜  路易斯
I always knew you was an idiot, Lewis.

329
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,830
你好啊
Hey, you.

330
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,290
这枪不错
Nice piece.

331
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,770
你他妈到底是谁  来闹事的坏蛋吗
Who the hell you supposed to be, some kinda badass?

332
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,100
不全是
Not really.

333
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,160
我有所谓的第二轴人格障碍[反社会型]
I have what's called an Axis II personality disorder.

334
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,110
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

335
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,960
意思是说下手杀掉你和你朋友时
It means when I kill you and your friends,

336
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,930
我会毫无感觉
I'm not really gonna feel anything.

337
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,730
你要杀我
You gonna kill me?

338
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,220
你才几斤几两  上百斤吗
You weight what, hundred pounds?

339
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,600
9毫米子弹  重约35克
9mm round weighs about a quarter of an ounce.

340
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,790
就能搞定了
It gets the job done.

341
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,190
你的枪是点45口径的  小妞儿
But your gun's a .45, little girl.

342
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,930
我说的是备用枪
I was talking about my backup piece.

343
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,420
路易斯  走吧
Lewis, go.

344
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,380
如果你告诉别人我的事
If you tell anybody about me...

345
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,480
我就会找到你
I will find you.

346
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,200
肖是最出色的  我亲自训练的
Shaw is one of our best. Trained her myself.

347
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,880
你找不到她的  除非她自愿被找到
You're not gonna find her until she wants to be found.

348
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,630
我们要知道她的计划
We need to know her game plan.

349
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,380
肖会继续查阿基诺的事
Is Shaw going to look into the Aquino situation,

350
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,410
还是会来追杀我们复仇
or simply come after us for revenge?

351
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,810
都会
Both.

352
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,300
她擅长兼顾多项任务  我们雇她正是为此
She's a multitasker. It's why we hired her.

353
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,060
我们要追查科尔在中情局的联系人
We need to track down Cole's contact in the CIA.

354
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,780
我已经查到了  她叫维罗妮卡・辛科莱
I'm already on it. Her name is Veronica Sinclair.

355
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,970
你发现了什么  搭档
What did you find, partner?

356
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,400
你好
Hello?

357
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,180
你好  维罗妮卡
Hello, Veronica.

358
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,080
我想和你聊聊迈克尔・科尔
I wanna talk to you about Michael Cole.

359
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,890
你是谁
Who is this?

360
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,360
你告诉他的事情
Whatever you told him...

361
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,330
让他丢了性命
may have gotten him killed.

362
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,940
拜托  我不能被卷入此事
Please. I can't be involved in this.

363
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,070
要么你来见我  要么我去追查你
Well, you either meet me or I track you down.

364
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,420
那可不会是你想要的
And that is not something that you want.

365
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,190
曼哈顿  斯福克酒店
Manhattan, the Suffolk Hotel,

366
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,120
1458房间  明晚5点
Room 1458, 5:00 PM tomorrow.

367
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,810
我会去的
I'll be there.

368
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,350
肖
Shaw.

369
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,270
猜到你早晚会给我电话
Figured you'd be calling me sooner or later.

370
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,980
你应该自首  萨姆
You should really come in, Sam.

371
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,190
你清楚你是逃不掉的
You know there's no point in running from us.

372
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,750
我会自首  但只对老大
I'll turn myself in, but only to the boss.

373
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,320
-我要见主控者  -我可不同意
- I wanna meet Control. - I don't think so.

374
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,160
我叫老大过来  你去杀他
I call my boss, you try to kill him.

375
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,670
这会让我很难堪的
It's very embarrassing for me.

376
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,270
我将会面地点发给你
I will send you the location,

377
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,750
你确保他会出现
you make sure he's there,

378
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,700
否则我公开阿基诺的档案
or else I go public with the Aquino files.

379
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
-什么时候  -今晚
- When? - Tonight.

380
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,280
威尔森  别让我等
And, Wilson, don't keep me waiting.

381
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,880
-你好  维罗妮卡  -进来吧
- Hello, Veronica. - Come in.

382
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,300
有人跟踪你吗
Any chance you were followed?

383
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,420
我觉得没有  不过
I don't think so, but...

384
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,790
我从训练营毕业后一直没出过外勤
I haven't been in the field since I was at the farm.

385
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,350
你是萨姆  对吗
You're Sam, right?

386
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,780
迈克尔跟我说起过你
Michael talked about you.

387
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,720
他没告诉我你们是做什么事的
I mean, he didn't tell me about what you guys do or anything,

388
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,120
不过  他喜欢你
but...he liked you.

389
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,750
他怎么了
What happened to him?

390
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,660
被杀了
He was killed.

391
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,220
执行任务时
On a mission.

392
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,920
你对这些知道越少
The less you know about all of this,

393
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,100
就越安全
the safer you'll be.

394
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,710
但我要知道他到底告诉你什么了
But I do need to know what he talked to you about.

395
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,880
迈克发给我一些资金转账信息
Mike sent over details of wire transfers

396
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,500
是转给核电工程师丹尼尔・阿基诺的
to a nuclear engineer named Daniel Aquino.

397
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,500
这些资金看起来是从
They appeared to originate

398
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,510
黎巴嫩真主党名下的账户中发出的  但是
out of accounts affiliated with Hezbollah, but...

399
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,080
有人篡改了那些电子转账信息
someone had electronically spoofed the transfers.

400
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,040
我查到了
I was able to track down

401
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,100
真正转出资金的账户
the real originating accounts.

402
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,830
资金是从美国政府汇出的
They were out of the US government.

403
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,410
政府什么部门
Which part of the government?

404
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,060
隶属五角大楼的组织
A group out of the pentagon

405
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,110
名叫"情报支持行动处"
called the Intelligence Support Activity.

406
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,260
你听说过他们吗
Have you heard of them?

407
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,200
可以这么说
You could say that.

408
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,550
直到昨天  我还在为他们工作
Up until yesterday, I worked for them.

409
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,670
他们的预算资金是机密
Their budget's confidential,

410
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,650
但是  从五年前就开始了
but... it stretches back five years.

411
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,840
大笔金额都拨给了一个叫
Huge amounts coded to a project

412
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,590
"北极光"的项目
called "Northern Lights."

413
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,990
这是什么项目
What was the project?

414
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,510
我不知道
I don't know.

415
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,640
但阿基诺参与了这个项目
But Aquino was part of it.

416
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,000
他们建立了一个叫"探索者"的设备
They built a facility of some kind coded as research.

417
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,220
但我查不到
But I can't find

418
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,040
其他项目参与者的名字
the names of anyone else involved in the project.

419
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,560
麦克说阿基诺告诉了你
Mike said Aquino told you

420
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,440
他在北极光项目中联系人的名字
the name of his contact in Northern Lights.

421
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,100
你还记得吗
Do you remember it?

422
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,950
待在这儿
Stay here.

423
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,540
离窗户远一点
And keep away from those windows.

424
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,750
你来之前  维罗妮卡和我闲聊了一会儿
Veronica and I had a bit of a chat before you got here.

425
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,890
她非常  非常努力地回忆所有
She tried really, really hard to remember anything else

426
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,490
对我有帮助的事情  但是
that could help me, but...

427
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,180
她一无所知
she didn't know anything.

428
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,590
我看过你的档案  我是你的忠实粉丝
I read your file, and I'm kind of a big fan.

429
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,650
所以  我真的不想伤害你
So, I really don't wanna hurt you.

430
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,880
我只需要个名字
I just need the name.

431
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,660
看来你根本不知道自己卷入了什么  是吧
You really have no idea what you're caught up in, do you?

432
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,770
不知道你到底是在为谁工作
Who you're actually working for?

433
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,790
你真的相信那些号码来自关塔那摩吗
Did you honestly think the source of the numbers was Guantanamo?

434
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,390
某个可怜的出租车司机正被关在笼子里慢慢腐烂吗
Some sad taxi driver rotting away in a cage somewhere?

435
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,230
你应该知道
I mean, you should know

436
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,370
严刑拷打几乎从来问不出有用的信息
torture almost never produces good information.

437
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,000
几乎
Almost never.

438
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,390
可惜的是
Sadly,

439
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,080
我们时间有点紧
we are on a bit of a clock.

440
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,780
威尔森的人三小时前就开始寻找维罗妮卡了
Wilson's men started looking for Veronica here three hours ago.

441
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,540
现在
Now...

442
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,880
阿基诺受雇为一个极特殊的东西建造场所
Aquino was hired to build a home for something very special,

443
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,170
我想找的东西
something I wanna find.

444
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,900
所以告诉我他联系人的名字
So you're gonna tell me the name of his contact.

445
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,290
我的档案里有一点漏了
One of the things I left out of my file...

446
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,500
我对这种事其实乐在其中
I kind of enjoy this sort of thing.

447
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,890
我真高兴你这么说
I am so glad you said that.

448
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,030
我也是呢
I do too.

449
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,810
我们刚要开始亲近一下呢
And just when we were starting to really connect.

450
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,010
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,790
有点无礼  我知道
A little rude, I know.

452
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,840
我们很快会再有机会的
We'll do this again soon.

453
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,150
安全
Clear!

454
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,930
全部安全
All clear.

455
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,370
靛蓝锁定  还有第二目标
Indigo located. And the secondary.

456
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,600
什么指示
Instructions?

457
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,830
明白
Understood.

458
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,770
帮个忙行吗
Can you do me a favor?

459
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,650
这次别对我开枪行吗
Can you not shoot me this time?

460
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,900
-给我一个理由  -我不知道
- Give me a good reason. - I don't know.

461
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,470
我是好人噢
I'm a really nice person,

462
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,980
还有  那个
and, well... that.

463
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,500
可以吗
May I?

464
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,880
好吧
Okay.

465
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,700
可能是乌头碱
It's probably acontine.

466
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,610
可以用阿托品解毒  如果我失手的话
You can counteract it with atropine...in case I bump it.

467
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,150
我们用的剂量  最多撑四分钟
The dose we use, you've got about four minutes.

468
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,050
所以除非你身上带着阿托品
So unless you've got some atropine on you,

469
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,430
否则别失手
don't bump it.

470
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,440
我的朋友想和你聊聊
I got a friend who wants to talk to you.

471
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,460
我为什么要和你的朋友聊呢
Why would I wanna talk to one of your friends?

472
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,580
你有别的地方可去吗
You got somewhere better to be?

473
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,310
你好  肖女士
Hello, Ms. Shaw.

474
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,710
你可以叫我哈罗德
You can call me Harold.

475
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,180
你是负责人
You're the man in charge?

476
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,180
不  没有负责人
No. No one's in charge.

477
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,270
我的朋友和我只是帮助需要帮助的人
My friend and I help people in trouble.

478
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,680
或许你们为威尔森工作  这是在跟我玩游戏
Or maybe you work for Wilson and this is all some kinda game.

479
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,290
坦白说  我从不擅长玩游戏
Honestly, I was never terribly good at games.

480
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,160
你为  至少曾经为
You work-- or at least you used to work--

481
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,120
一个秘密政府组织工作
for a secret government program

482
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,240
旨在预防涉及到
that prevents terrible things--

483
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,310
国家安全的恐怖袭击和犯罪活动
terrorist acts and crimes relevant to nation security.

484
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,860
你收到的消息
The information that you received

485
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,650
来自一群你称之为"探索者"的人
came from a group of people that you call "Research."

486
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,280
他们以两点著称
And it's notable for two reasons.

487
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,690
第一  从不出错
One, it's never wrong.

488
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,310
第二  只给号码
And two, it consists only of a number.

489
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,450
-这是  -你的号码
- This is-- - Your number.

490
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,440
还有科尔先生的
And Mr. Cole's.

491
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,330
我们没救出他  我为此深感遗憾
We were unable to save him, and for that, I'm sorry.

492
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,790
我们最初不了解
We didn't understand the exact nature

493
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,510
你们的准确情况
of your situation at first.

494
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,950
既然你们不是那个组织的
So if you're not part of the program...

495
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,810
那你们是谁
then who are you?

496
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,530
这么说吧  说到底
Let's just say that ultimately,

497
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,300
你我为同一实体工作
you and I work for the same entity.

498
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,990
而这一实体让你
And that entity wanted you

499
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,570
和你朋友去救我吗
and your friend over there to help me?

500
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,070
可以这么说
In a manner of speaking.

501
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,180
实际上  我们应该是唯一能救你的人
In truth, we're probably the only people who can help you.

502
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,770
既然你这么了解我的雇主
Well, if you know so much about my employers,

503
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,520
你一定也知道他们非常
then you must know that they are very...

504
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,550
非常善于找人
very good at finding people.

505
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,350
即使是你  也不能永远逃下去
Even you can't run forever.

506
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,650
我不需要永远
I don't need forever.

507
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,840
只要找到背后主使者
Just long enough to find the man behind the curtain,

508
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,490
那个下灭口命令的人
the one who gave the kill order.

509
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,280
你连他们组织的皮毛都伤不到
You won't even scratch the surface of their organization,

510
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,840
而你却会一直面临生命危险
and you'll still be in grave danger.

511
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,420
你掌握着谜题的一块
You hold a piece of a puzzle,

512
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,280
这秘密非常重要  他们为保护它不惜杀死
a secret so important that they were willing to kill

513
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,440
阿基诺博士  你朋友迈克尔・科尔  还有你
Dr. Aquino and your friend Michael Cole and yourself to protect it.

514
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,650
你所谓"探索者"那群人的真相
The truth about a group of people you call "Research".

515
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,820
科尔已经开始怀疑了
Something that Cole had begun to suspect.

516
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,800
-是什么  -他们根本不存在
- Which is what? - That they don't exist.

517
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,540
这个世界看上去和十年前一样
The world looks like it did ten years ago,

518
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,220
但实际上  已经截然不同了
but underneath, it's become very strange indeed.

519
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,800
一场无形的斗争已经开始
An invisible struggle has begun.

520
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,390
大多数知情者已经死了
Most of the people who knew this are already dead.

521
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,920
一切顺利的话  我希望你能免步后尘
All things being equal, I prefer you didn't join them.

522
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,250
如我所说  我们可以帮助你
So like I said... we're here to help you.

523
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,990
但首先  你得停止逃跑
But first, you need to stop running

524
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,650
因为你太内行了  我们跟不住你
because you're much too good at it and we can't keep up.

525
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,630
-躲藏不是我的风格  -那死亡是吗
- Hiding isn't my style. - But dying is?

526
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,500
因为在我看来  这是唯一的选项
Because, as I see it, that's your only option.

527
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,120
我没有什么朋友
You know, I never had many friends.

528
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,750
觉得对我没用
Didn't have much use for 'em.

529
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,040
科尔是唯一的例外
Cole was an exception.

530
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,830
他的命运不该那样
And he deserved better.

531
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,550
一个忠告
A word of advice for what it's worth.

532
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,870
去纠正这个世界的错误
Set out to correct the world's wrongs

533
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,100
往往结果只是错上加错
and you'll almost certainly wind up adding to them.

534
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,120
我的电话  如果你改变主意的话
My number, in case you change your mind.

535
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,050
谢了
Thanks.

536
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,650
不过免了  谢了
But no thanks.

537
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,270
该了结一切了  就今晚
It's time to end this. Tonight.

538
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,150
-把队伍准备好  -是  先生
- Get a team ready. - Yes, Sir.

539
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,430
你迟到了
You're late.

540
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,660
我本想问你怎么知道是我
I'd ask how you knew it was me,

541
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,300
不过我们雇你正是为此
but I guess that's what we pay you for--

542
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,610
在人群中找到对的人
picking the right person out of a crowd.

543
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,100
我当然想见见主控者
Of course I wanted to meet Control.

544
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,520
而你不是主控者  对吗
And you're not Control, now, are you?

545
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,620
很遗憾  不是
Sadly, no.

546
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,400
但你也只能找到我这一级了
But I'm as close as you're gonna get.

547
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,250
你置组织于危险之中
You'd really put the program in jeopardy

548
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,480
就为给你搭档报仇
just to avenge your partner?

549
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,950
我以为你这样的女人
I assumed a woman like you

550
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,150
应该会有更成熟的世界观呢
would have a more sophisticated world view.

551
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,530
你们雇我  是因为我基本上不在乎别人
You people hired me because I don't care about most people.

552
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,130
然而你们却杀死了
And then you went and killed

553
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,260
我唯一喜欢的人
the one person that I actually liked.

554
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,190
有道理
Fair enough.

555
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,210
当然   你也不该满怀怨恨地出现
Of course, you weren't supposed to be around to carry a grudge.

556
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,960
你想见面
You wanted to meet.

557
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,980
是想查明为什么我让威尔森
Was it to find out why I let Wilson

558
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,040
除掉你和你的搭档吗
target you and your partner?

559
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,170
还是只想杀了我
Or just to kill me?

560
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,920
无论哪个  我们都该换个隐秘点的地方
Either way, we should go somewhere more private.

561
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,620
或许你认为我很邪恶
You probably think I made a devil's bargain.

562
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,240
或许吧
And maybe I have.

563
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,500
但正是因为这个组织
But the program is the reason

564
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,790
我们才避免了再受重大袭击
we haven't had another major attack.

565
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,190
如果公众知道我们的所作所为
If the public knew about what we do,

566
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,740
我们就会失去这一能力
we'd lose that ability.

567
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,260
阿基诺呢
And Aquino?

568
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,120
同样  令人遗憾的决定
Again, a regrettable decision,

569
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,350
但却是必须的
but a necessary one.

570
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,470
没有人能置身于千百万国人的安危之上
No one life is above the safety of millions of Americans.

571
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:54,000
我每天都得做这种丑陋的算计
That's the ugly math that I have to deal with every day.

572
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,520
你应该最明白的
You of all people should understand that.

573
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,330
的确
I do.

574
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,030
我在你的位子上  也会做同样的事
And if I were in your place, I'd do the exact same thing.

575
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,800
我或许不再和这组织有关系了
I may not be in the program anymore,

576
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,660
但是我
but I--

577
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,650
我仍理解它有多重要
I still understand how important it is.

578
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,880
那为什么要打打杀杀的
Then why the cloak and dagger?

579
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,140
科尔关于阿基诺案的调查
Cole's research on the Aquino case.

580
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,130
我想亲自交给你
I wanted to give it to you personally.

581
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,850
为什么不交给威尔森
Why not give it to Wilson?

582
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,110
你雇了科尔这种人
You can't hire people like Cole

583
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,780
就不要指望他们会乖如羔羊
and expect them to act like sheep.

584
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,600
我只会服从命令
Now, I know how to follow orders.

585
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,950
但科尔非常聪明
But Cole was just brilliant,

586
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,400
相信凡事必有因
and he believed in the cause.

587
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,900
威尔森清楚这点
And Wilson knew that.

588
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
你本可以警告他  或者警告我
You know, you could've warned him, or even me.

589
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,910
但你却直接下格杀令
But instead, you placed a kill order

590
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,980
必除之而后快
like we were some kinda problem to be solved.

591
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,990
你的搭档违反了规定
Your partner broke the rules.

592
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,770
你跟他一样对此纠结不已
You're on the hook for that as much as he was.

593
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,340
然后你就华丽丽地搞砸了任务
And then you screwed that up in such a spectacular fashion.

594
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,840
我怎么能在这么重要的事上信任这个蠢货
How could I trust this idiot with something so important?

595
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,520
赫什说得对
Hersh was right.

596
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,190
你是名优秀的士兵
You are a good soldier.

597
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,120
你并不是想复仇
You didn't want revenge.

598
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,940
你是想保护组织
You wanted to protect the program.

599
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,520
优秀的士兵会兼顾
A good soldier does both.

600
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,140
放她走
Let her go.

601
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,370
清理一下
Let's clean this up.

602
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,730
{\an9}? You can holler, you can wail ?

603
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,480
{\an9}? You can swing, you can flail ?

604
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,080
{\an9}? You can like a broken sail ?

605
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,250
{\an9}? But I'll never give you up ?

606
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,040
{\an9}? If I ever give you up ?

607
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,760
{\an9}? My heart will surely fail ?

608
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,830
你是优秀的特工  抱歉  肖
You were a good operator. Sorry, Shaw.

609
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,000
{\an9}? And after all, God can keep my soul ?

610
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,120
{\an9}? England have my bones ?

611
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,170
{\an9}? But don't ever give me up ?

612
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,090
{\an9}? I could never get back up ?

613
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,140
{\an9}? When the future starts so slow ?

614
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,210
这位女士直接昏倒在街上
Lady just passed out in the street,

615
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,970
心肺复苏无效
unresponsive to CPR.

616
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,080
急救人员一到场就宣布死亡了
EMT's called it as soon as they arrived.

617
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,540
你认为这就是凶杀了
So this looks like a homicide to you?

618
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,780
当然  这个年纪的女人  没有一点伤痕
Sure. Woman her age, not a mark on her.

619
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,230
我觉得很可疑
I thought it suspicious.

620
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,490
可没想到凶案组能出现
Can't expect the task force to show up.

621
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,850
我们就在附近  弗莱明警官
We were in the neighborhood, Officer Fleming.

622
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,520
这位大概药物过量或者心脏骤停
Yeah, we're probably looking at an overdose or cardiac arrest.

623
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,690
好的  但为了确定  我们得
Yeah, but, I mean, just to make sure, we ought to--

624
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,620
你不如去给自己买杯咖啡吧
Why don't you grab yourself a coffee?

625
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,810
我们来处理好吧
We got this, okay?

626
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,650
谢谢你的帮助
Thanks for your help.

627
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,930
又到满月抽风时  验尸官办公室忙不过来了
It's a full moon. Coroner's office is swamped.

628
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,240
把她运到下城区行吗
You mind getting her downtown?

629
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,540
听你的  警探
Whatever you say, Detective.

630
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
搭把手好吗
Little help here?

631
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,740
{\an9}? You can holler, you can wail ?

632
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,180
{\an9}? You can blow what's left of my right mind ?

633
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,250
{\an9}? You can swing, you can flail ?

634
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,360
她是性感
She may be hot,

635
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,830
但我不想再看见那妞儿了
but that's one broad I never wanna see again.

636
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,170
永永远远
I mean, ever!

637
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,480
你们从没告诉我她既危险  又疯狂
You guys never told me she was dangerous and crazy!

638
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,420
可怕的组合
Bad combo.

639
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,560
怎么了
What happened?

640
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,980
我给她注射了阿托品和杜冷丁让她保持昏迷
I gave her the atropine and some demerol to knock her out.

641
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,500
但是她在半路就醒了
But she woke up on the drive over

642
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,880
差点杀了我
and almost killed me!

643
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,300
瞧  瞧我脖子上的瘀伤
Look--look at this bruise on my neck.

644
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,380
所以我加大了量
So I gave her some more.

645
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,400
多大量  陶先生
How much more, Mr. Tao?

646
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,750
我不知道  你瞧我像医生吗
I don't know. I look like a doctor to you?

647
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,040
天啊
Man.

648
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,660
这烂事的报酬可真不够
I so don't get paid enough for this crap.

649
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,660
我们根本没付报酬  里昂
We don't pay you anything, Leon.

650
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,760
我得闪远点了  两位
I'm gonna widen the distance, fellas.

651
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,400
你们试试吧
You take your chances.

652
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,380
死亡会让人口渴
Dying can make you thirsty.

653
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,650
作为守护天使
For Guardian Angels,

654
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,180
你们两位来得也太迟了
you two were a bit late to the party.

655
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,270
你的雇主希望你死
Your employers wanted you dead.

656
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,090
所以你死了
So now you are.

657
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,770
我想里昂忘记了
I guess Leon forgot the instructions

658
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,270
要搜你身的指令
about patting you down.

659
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,200
肖女士  我们是帮你的
Ms. Shaw, we're on your side.

660
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,770
我想我们已经证明你可以信任我们
I feel like we've proven that you can trust us.

661
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,540
信任未免过了
Trust is overrated.

662
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,460
把电话给我
Toss me your phones.

663
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,700
如我上次所说
Like I said before...

664
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,090
如果你改变主意的话
just in case you change your mind.

665
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,880
此电话大大有惊喜  打打试试吧

666
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,770
{\an9}? You can holler, you can wail ?

667
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,960
{\an9}? You can blow what's left of my right mind ?

668
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,450
{\an9}? You can swing, you can flail ?

669
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,270
她真叫人印象深刻
Well, she certainly makes an impression.

670
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,990
你觉得她会帮我们叫出租车吗
Do you think she'll call us a taxi?

671
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,650
{\an9}? You can holler, you can wail ?

672
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,890
{\an9}? You can blow what's left of my right mind ?
