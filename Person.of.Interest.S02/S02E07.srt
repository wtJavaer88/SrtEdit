162
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,740
急救人员无法稳定血压

163
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,770
收缩压70  舒张压测不到
Systolic was 70, but diastolic was impalpable.

164
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,960
他有枪
He's got a gun.

165
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,740
全都闭嘴
Everybody shut up!

166
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,060
你是想耍横
You wanna be a tough guy,

167
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,710
还是想我救你朋友的命
or you want me to save your friend's life?

168
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,260
护士  病人低容量性休克
Nurse, this man is in hypovolemic shock,

169
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,520
我想是肺不张
and I think a collapsed lung

170
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,150
所以会出现这种血氧饱和度读数
is what's giving those O-2 readings.

171
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,100
好  我们走

172
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,290
准备手术和开胸手术托盘

173
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,500
给我个约束带  以防他咬到自己舌头

她看起来镇定自如
She certainly seems unflappable.

175
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,080

I'd say.

176

你确定她以前不是军医吗
You sure she was never a combat medic?

177
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,600
我都不确定她现在不是
I'm not so sure she isn't one now.

178
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,360
除了手术中的持枪黑帮  还有别的威胁吗
So what's the threat besides gun-toting gangs in surgery?

179
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,040
有可能来自任何方面
It could come from anywhere else:

180
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,150
她过去的医疗事故
a malpractice in her past;

181
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,760
治疗中死亡病患的家属
a bereaved relative of a patient she lost.

182
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,600
或者像通常一样  私生活方面的

我们得去找她
Well, we need to get to her.

277
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,600
我们通不过威尔德的保镖
We'll never get past Veldt's security.

278
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,440
何况  只要他的保镖在
Besides, as long as his guards are around,

279
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,730
她在手术中应该是安全的
she should be safe in surgery.

280
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,280
我担心的是她妻子
It's her wife that I'm worried about.

281
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,140
有人守在医生这边比较好
It might be good to have someone near the doctor.

282
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,900
我在这里守着
I'll stay here.

283
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,870

I'll handle the park and assess the threat on Amy.

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,090
在大纽约额信托服务公司工作

292
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,100
只是抢劫吗
Straight-up robbery?

293
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,380
开始我也这么想...
That's what I thought...

294
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,410
但我在他身上找到了这个
till I found this on him.

295
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,320
我觉得没必要和其他人说
I didn't feel the need to share with others.

296
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,530
看背面
Check the back.

297
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,250
什么意思
What does that mean?

298
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,670
我还以为你能告诉我呢
I thought you could tell me.

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,920
你还是快走吧
Well, you might wanna get out of here

300
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
免得被人问到无法回答的问题
before people start asking questions you can't answer.

301
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,860
谢了
Thanks.

305
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,880
我到底要签多少才够送出这条命的
How many forms will it take for me to sign my life away?

306
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,320
莉兹只是在履行她的职责  威尔德先生
Liz is just doing her job, Mr. Veldt.

307
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,440
任何手术都会有风险
Any surgery has its risks.

308
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,350
我选择全州最顶尖的外科医生以消除风险
And I chose the top surgeon in the state to eliminate them.

309
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
你最好记住了
You'd do best to remember that.

310
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,600
医生
Doctor?

311
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,010
一旦手术开始  你是打算用
Once the procedure begins, are you planning on using

312
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,110
隐静脉作搭桥血管吗
the saphenous vein for the bypassing channel?

313
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,800
不  我会使用乳内动脉接合
No, I'll use the internal mammary artery for grafts,

314
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,820
任何一名医学博士都会告诉你
which anyone with an MD will tell you

315
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,510
这是目前最佳的长效疗法
shows the best long-term results.

316
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,190
不过  谢谢你无谓的操心  莱恩斯先生
But thank you for your unnecessary concern, Mr. Rains.

317
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,210
{\pos(136,168)}新消息
未知号码
该行动了
医生

318
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,110
我在麦蒂的办公室  里瑟先生
I'm in Maddy's office, Mr. Reese.

319
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,940
我也许可以用她的电脑找出
With her computer, perhaps I can discover

320
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,120
威尔德和韦斯利之间的联系
the connection between Veldt and Wesley.

321
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,020
我在公园  芬奇
I'm at the park now, Finch.

322
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,540
看到艾米了  她的位置暴露到极点了
Got eyes on Amy, and she couldn't be more exposed.

323
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,380
还有好多围观者在她旁边
Lots of bystanders around here too.

324
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,150
依照韦斯利的规则  如果我们惊动警方
According to Wesley's rules, if we alert the police,

325
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,220
她就会死
she's dead.

326
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,460
那我们找到狙击手
Then we find the sniper.

327
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,960
我们还知道阿利斯塔・韦斯利什么情况
We know anything more about Alistair Wesley?

328
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,600
除了名字和口音吗
Besides his name and that accent?

329
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,830
被困在外科楼里
I can't find out anymore

330
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,640
我找不出任何东西
while I'm stuck here in the surgical wing.

331
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,250
那就有什么查什么吧
Then we'll work with what we got.

332
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,060
我破解了韦斯利发过来的
I was able to decode the live video

333
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,080
艾米在公园里的视频
of Amy in the park that Wesley sent,

334
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,540
所以只要麦蒂在医院里面接收
so as long as Maddy is streaming it here in the hospital,

335
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,220
我们就能看到
we'll be able to see it too.

336
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,680
图像发给你了
Sending you an image.

337
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,980
你能用这个三角定位狙击手位置吗
Can you use it to triangulate the sniper's position?

338
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,300
又不是第一次了
It wouldn't be the first time.

339
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,180
根据麦蒂的个人文件
From Maddy's personal file,

340
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,280
奥利弗・威尔德是O型阴性血
it seems that Oliver Veldt's blood type is O-negative.

341
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,340
如果我黑进医院的库存目录
If I can hack the hospital's inventory

342
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,800
让O型阴性血显示短缺
and register a shortage of O-negative blood,

343
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,650
{\pos(210,29)}纽约综合医院

344
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,650
{\pos(210,84)}血库库存

345
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,850
就可以推迟手术
I could stall the surgery

346
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,470
且不违反韦斯利的规则
without breaking any of Wesley's rules.

347
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,490
芬奇  我找到狙击手的位置了
Finch, I pinpointed the sniper's location.

348
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,750
根据激光判断  狙击手位于东北方向
Based on that laser, our sniper has a northeast position

349
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
至少是八楼以上的位置
at least eight floors up.

350
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,580
第三代防弹衣
Type iii ballistic body armor.

351
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,580
别担心  肋骨断了会愈合的
Don't worry. Those ribs'll heal.

352
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,850
不明身份  芬奇
No ID, Finch.

指尖上有强力胶
Super glue on his finger tips.

354
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,290
典型的机密行动把戏
Classic black ops trick.

355
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,090
你好  神秘来客先生
Hello, Mr. Mystery Guest.

356
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,990
韦斯利  是吗  阿利斯塔・韦斯利
Wesley, is it-- Alistair Wesley?

357
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,010
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are

358
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,880
也不知道你对我的同伴做了什么
or what you just did to my associate,

359
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,730
不过我倒是想请你喝一杯
but I'd like to buy you a drink,

360
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,390
否则艾米马上就会死
or Amy dies immediately.

361
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,300
提议不错  不过你的狙击手已经敬过酒了
That's a kind offer, but your sniper's toast.

362
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,170
你在虚张声势
I'll call your bluff.

363
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,860
你以为他是一个人
You're assuming he was alone.

364
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,760
各单位报到
All units check in.

里瑟先生  你准备怎么办
Mr. Reese, what will you do?

371
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,290
看来要去喝一杯了
Guess I'll go have that drink.

372
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,900
好吧  巴比克先生  是谁要你死
Okay, Mr. Babic, who wanted you dead,

373
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,640
他们又想告诉我什么呢
and what are they trying to tell me?

374
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,950

I didn't figure you for a day-in-the-park kind of guy.

381
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,950
人人都爱大自然啊  莱奈尔
Anyone can appreciate nature, Lionel.

382
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,890
到底什么事
So what's up?

383
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,010
看到那边的艺术市集了吗
See that art fair over there?

384
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,470
是那位美丽的年轻女士主办的
There's a nice young lady running it.

385
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,300
她叫艾米
Her name's Amy.

386
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,250
我需要你照看她一下
I need you to keep an eye on her for a minute.

387
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,660
什么  她惹上什么麻烦吗
What--she in some kind of trouble?

388
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,630
这么说吧  她被几架瞄准器瞄着呢
Let's just say she found herself in a few crosshairs.

389
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,430
等等  你要去哪里
Wait, where you going?

390
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,550
-去喝一杯  -啥

391
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,260
这是专业团队  芬奇

392
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,180
把这些人弄来执行这计划
If they were brought on to execute this plan,

393
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,490
肯定有人付钱了
someone is paying them.

394
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,950
很遗憾  我今天没法扮侦探了
Unfortunately, I'm unable to play detective today,

395
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,950
不过我知道个合适的人选
but I know somebody perfect.

396
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,480
我知道奥利弗・威尔德
I-I know who Oliver Veldt is--

397
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,470
能源大亨  对吧
energy guy, right?

398
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,210
就其为半个东海岸
Energy in the sense that he supplies power

399
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,010
提供能源这点来说  没错
to half the eastern seaboard, yes.

400
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,610
有人想弄死他啊
Someone wants to flatline him, huh?

401
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,710
现在有一份工作  正好适合
We have a job that's a perfect fit

402
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,680
你这个前法务会计师来做
for a former forensic accountant.

403
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,930
就当是网络寻宝活动
Think of it as a digital treasure hunt.

404
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,890
找出企业界中  谁以威尔德为目标
Find out who would target Veldt in the corporate world,

405
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,630
跟踪支付职业杀手资金的流向
follow the money trail to the hit team,

406
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,590
帮我们从源头遏制这场阴谋
and help us stop the plot at its source.

407
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,950
我要怎么做
How am I supposed to do that?

408
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,400
去我的电脑台
Go over to my computer station.

409
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,090
我不能碰电脑的  记得不
I'm not supposed to touch the computer, remember?

410
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,670
你那只正在节食的食人兽
And your special diet man-eater

411
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,230
连键盘都不让我靠近
won't let me go anywhere near the keyboard.

412
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,260
开免提
Put me on speakerphone.

413
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,700
小熊
Bear?

414
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,600
[荷兰语]去休息
Ontspan.

415
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,310
昂  昂死判
Ont--ontspan?

416
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,480
懂外语的蠢狗  明白了
Multilingual mutt-- dig it.

417
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,930
先列出威尔德的敌人名单
Start by composing a list of Veldt's enemies.

418
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,290
威尔德死了  谁获益最大
Who stands to benefit most from Veldt's death?

419
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,400
是不是别的公司策划的
Did another company plot it?

420
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,310
那还真是重新定义了"恶意并购"
Gives new meaning to the phrase "Hostile takeover," huh?

421
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,580
我正在累积对你的信任  陶先生
I'm extending an element of trust to you, Mr. Tao.

422
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,400
请不要试探我系统的底限
Please resist the temptation to test the limits of my system.

423
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,920
咱像是会让你失望的人吗
Do I seem like the kind of guy who would let you down?

424
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,100
知道为什么优秀的酒保喜欢用大冰块吗
Do you know why a good barman favors larger ice cubes?

425
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,340
融化慢
They melt slower.

426
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,670
而且不会冲淡威士忌
And they don't dilute the whiskey,

427
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,030
正如一个紧凑的计划容不得半点干扰
the way a tight plan doesn't obscure its objectives.

428
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,120
这是防止我对你出手吗
Is that to protect you from me?

429
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,240
不  只是有助于对付门口你那位哨兵
No, but it might help against your sentry at the door.

430
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,780
填字游戏下的消音枪
The silencer poking out of his crossword section

431
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,390
足够露底了
was a pretty good giveaway.

432
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,080
我在现场处处装有监控摄像头
I have my own cameras positioned all over,

433
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,100
还有一组特工在那位妻子身边巡查
and a troop of operatives running recce on the wife.

434
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,940
分分钟都有人近到足以动手杀掉她
There's always someone close enough to kill her

435
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,210
只需一声令下
at a moment's notice.

436
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,800
所以把枪收好  喝一杯
So put away the gun and have a drink.

437
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,180
你是前军情六处的
I'd say you were a former MI-6,

438
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,290
你的队员  全是前英国空军特种部队的
and your team--all Ex-SAS.

439
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,190
你反应迅速
You're good on your feet,

440
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,350
思路清楚  判断准确
and you know your way around an asset.

441
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,800
前中情局的
Ex-CIA?

442
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,130
高手
Smashing.

443
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,450
-你要价多少  -恕不外售
- How much do you cost? - Not for sale.

444
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,910
你为威尔德工作
You're working for Veldt?

445
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,870
额外保镖之类的
Some kind of additional security?

446
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,670
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

447
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,230
重要的是  你被发现了
What matters is-- if you were caught,

448
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,910
我干嘛不杀那妻子呢
why didn't I kill the wife?

449
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,580
因为医生还没有违背你的规则
Because the doctor hasn't broken any of your rules yet.

450
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,410
确实  但我的风度是有底限的
Exactly, but my sense of propriety has its limits.

451
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,500
离公园远点  离那妻子远点
Now stay out of the park and away from the wife.

452
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,640
这不是你的游戏  没人邀请你来玩
This isn't your game, and no one's invited you to play.

453
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,800
别试探我的底线
Don't test me.

454
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,970
我预想了所有的可能
I was expecting everything.

455
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,540
你没预想到我
You weren't expecting me.

456
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,730
我们很快就准备好了  医生
We'll be ready for you soon, doctor.

457
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,680
{\pos(160,97)}新短信
艾米
我知道我的心交到你手中
就对了  医生

458
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,070
恩耐特医生  我不想打搅你
Dr. Enright, I hate to bother you.

459
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,230
你来这儿干吗
What are you doing in here?

460
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,860
还记得我吗  今天早前见过
Do you remember me? From earlier today?

461
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,610
你是那名捐赠者  克灵
You're that donor--Crane.

462
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,490
你可能不相信  但我知道你的妻子艾米
Look, you may not believe this, but I know your wife, Amy,

463
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,450
也知道你现在的困境
and I know the predicament that you're in.

464
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,880
我的同伴正在保护她的安全
I have an associate who's working now to ensure her safety,

465
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,890
你一定得相信我们
but you have to trust us.

466
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,950
你是谁
Who are you?

467
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,870
我怎么知道你不是那人的手下
How do I know you're not working for that man?

468
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,890
这场手术本该在二十分钟前开始
This procedure was supposed to start 20 minutes ago,

469
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,950
但是我更改了医院血库库存
but I altered the hospital blood records

470
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,600
以推迟手术
to delay the surgery.

471
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,710
马上就会有护士来解释这件事
In a moment, a nurse will come in here to explain the error.

472
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,310
现在仔细听我说
Now listen to me carefully.

473
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,620
我们不能让韦斯利起疑心
We can't make Wesley suspicious,

474
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,420
但我们会在你被迫做选择前救出艾米
but we'll save Amy before you have to make the incision.

475
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,160
医生  我去楼下检查过O型阴性血的库存记录了
Doctor, I checked the O-Neg records downstairs.

476
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,540
是电脑系统出错  他们正在修复
It's a computer mix-up. They're fixing the glitch.

477
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,840
库存血液很充足
We have plenty of blood reserves.

478
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,630
一会儿就可以开始了
We should be ready to go shortly.

479
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,050
莉兹  这位是克灵医生
Liz, this is Dr. Crane.

480
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
我叫他来作副手  以备不时之需
I brought him in as a second scrub if I need help.

481
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,310
听您安排  医生
Whatever you say, doctor.

482
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,940
救救我
Help me.

483
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,880
救救我和艾米
Help us, Amy and I.

484
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,000
否则我不知道自己会怎样
Or I don't know what I'll do.

485
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,420
麦蒂已经进入手术室了  里瑟先生
Maddy has officially gone into the operating room, Mr. Reese.

486
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,580
公园那边进展如何
How are things in the park?

487
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,830
我跟韦斯利那一杯喝得不怎么样
My drink with Wesley didn't go so well,

488
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,050
不过至少干掉一个他的人
but we can count another one of his operatives out.

489
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,250
他装了自己的摄像头
He brought his own cameras

490
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,310
监控了公园的每个角落
and has every inch of this park monitored.

491
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,210
看来他也明白监控的价值
It seems that he too knows the value of surveillance.

492
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,180
更糟糕的是  如果他的手下选对了
What's worse-- if he chose his people well,

493
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,680
我们根本无法从人群中找出潜伏者
we'll never pick his sleepers out of a crowd this big.

494
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,450
通道和套管都已经插好了
Ports and trocar is inserted.

495
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,220
我准备截取移植的乳内动脉了
I'll start the harvest of the mammary...artery.

496
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,720
没事吧  医生
Is everything all right, doctor?

497
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,100
请把摄像头往
Readjust the camera a millimeter

498
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,190
冠状动脉主干方向调整一毫米
along the main coronary, please.

499
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,140
现在怎么样  医生
How is that, doctor?

500
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,370
加大冲洗量
Increasing irrigation.

501
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,070
再抽吸
Applying more suction.

502
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,910
她正在往威尔德的静脉注射抗凝血剂
She's injecting the anticoagulant into Veldt's IV.

503
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,340
里瑟先生  我们时间不多了
Mr. Reese, we're running out of time.

504
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,280
里瑟先生  麦蒂正在努力坚持
Mr. Reese, Maddy's holding it together somehow,

505
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,050
但注射了肝素后  威尔德就是个定时炸弹
but after that injection of heparin, Veldt's a time bomb.

506
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,570
稍微切错一点点
any wrong incision at this point--

507
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,900
等等
Hold on.

508
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,680
陶先生  你有何发现
Mr. Tao, what did you find?

509
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,190
芬奇  老兄
Finch! Boobie--

510
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,790
我从威尔德公司网站的一个后门程序
I hacked into the Veldt Corp. servers

511
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,460
黑进了他们的服务器
using a back door in their website

512
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,910
发现了一个亿万美金的项目提案
and found a proposed multimillion-dollar project

513
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,530
是关于海上风电的
for offshore wind farms.

514
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,680
威尔德驳回了
Veldt dismissed it.

515
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,630
他称之为"不切实际的白日梦"
An "unsustainable pipe dream," he called it.

516
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,950
-这是他的原话  -里昂
- That's an actual quote... - Leon.

517
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,380
我给证监会的一个老酒友打了电话
I called an old drinking buddy at the SEC

518
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
他给我寄了些蓝表
who sent me blue sheets,

519
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,250
内容是月度股票活动追踪
monthly reports tracking stock activity.

520
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,110
我发现一系列针对威尔德股票的卖空行为
I found a series of short sales for Veldt's stock.

521
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,840
成交价非常高
It's trading at an all-time high,

522
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,440
看来有人赌这公司会出大事儿
so someone's betting that the company fails big.

523
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,340
如果股票跌了  投资人就能大赚一笔
That investor will make a fortune if the stock drops.

524
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,650
比如首席执行官在进行秘密手术时
For instance, if the CEO underwent a secret surgery

525
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,760
死在了手术台上
and died on the table.

526
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,860
没错
Yahtzee.

527
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,880
一定是韦斯利那伙人
It must be Wesley and his associates.

528
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,470
他们从自己的行动中捞钱
They're financing their own operation.

529
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,160
我从网络运营商那儿发现了有卖空纪录的服务器
I found an active server at the ISP for those short sales.

530
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,550
这套利机会应该值得关注
Could be an interesting arbitrage opportunity here.

531
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,850
我会继续查
I'll keep digging.

532
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,460
有发现立刻通知我
Let me know the minute you find something.

533
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,070
您好  医生
Hello, doctor.

534
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,260
仍在努力保护您的妻子
Still trying to secure your wife.

535
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,650
各位  我要稍事休息
Everyone, I'm going to need to take a short break

536
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,710
歇几分钟
for a few minutes.

537
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,040
您还好吗  医生
Are you all right, doctor?

538
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,470
我们需要找人
Do we need to get someone in here

539
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,890
协助手术吗
to assist with the surgery?

540
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,890
不用  没必要  莉兹
No, that won't be necessary, Liz.

541
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,680
请注意病人的体征
Please monitor the patient's vitals,

542
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,550
我很快就回来
and I'll be right back.

543
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,410
我们就不能再做点什么吗
Is there nothing more we can do?

544
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,390
我保证  我的同伴很快
I promise you-- my associate is close

545
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,080
就能解除艾米的危机了
to getting Amy out of danger.

546
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,930
好  我  我得歇一下
Yeah, I just-- I need a minute.

547
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,880
为什么停下来  医生
Why did you stop, doctor?

548
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,510
我想你还不明白此事的严重性
I don't think you understand how serious this is.

549
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,290
给你加点动力如何
How about a little motivation?

550
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,380
我现在会连线你的妻子
I'm going to connect you to your wife now.

551
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,380
你有30秒钟  记住规则
You have 30 seconds, but do remember the rules

552
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,710
和违规的代价
and how much you have to lose.

553
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,020
抱歉  我要接个电话
Ooh, sorry. I have to take this.

554
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,180
宝贝  我以为你在做手术呢
Hi, babe! I thought you were in surgery.

555
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,400
还在做
Still going.

556
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,100
我只是  稍歇一下  喘口气
I just, uh, took a break to catch my breath.

557
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,870
虽然比不上你那边
Uh, it's nothing compared to yours,

558
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,880
不过我这儿也是一团乱
but it's been nuts here.

559
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,750
捐赠者野餐会的承办人没来
The caterers didn't show for the donor picnic,

560
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,860
我只能勉强凑合
and I had to scramble.

561
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,750
抱歉  艾米  我只有一点时间
I'm sorry, Ames -- um, I only have a minute.

562
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,920
时间表真是  逼死人
The timetable is...killer.

563
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,250
我只想听听你的声音
I just wanted to hear your voice.

564
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,670
你还好吗
Is everything all right?

565
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,870
都好
Totally fine.

566
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,020
我爱你
I love you.

567
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,630
我也爱你
I love you, too.

568
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,100
坚持啊
Hang in there.

569
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,900
韦斯利不到一分钟就知道
Wesley knew the surgery was interrupted

570
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,050
手术暂停了
in less than a minute.

571
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,660
他在医院一定有耳目
He must have eyes and ears in that hospital somewhere.

572
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,020
我们别无选择了  芬奇
We don't have a choice, Finch.

573
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,650
我去把艾米救出来
I'm getting Amy out.

574
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,070
全部人都待在广场上
Everybody has to stay in the plaza

575
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,510
直到我们查清楚
until we work this out.

576
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,250
打扰一下
Excuse me.

577
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,350
卡特警探  凶案组的
Detective Carter, Homicide.

578
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,050
凶案组  你们来得真快
Homicide? You got here pretty fast.

579
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,030
我们几分钟前刚报警说有枪声
We just called in shots fired a few minutes ago.

580
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,690
还不清楚是否有尸体
I don't know if there are any bodies yet.

581
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,230
里面开枪了
There was shots fired inside?

582
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,930
好像是抢劫
Some kind of botched robbery.

583
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,530
这是什么地方
What is this place?

584
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,880
藤真科技研究工厂
Fujima Techtronics Research Facility.

585
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,380
警报是从研发区的无菌层传来的
Alarms went off on the clean room floor, where they do R&D.

586
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,150
有人进去  封了出口
Guy got inside, had his exit blocked,

587
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,470
开枪  保安倒地  救护车正在路上
shots fired, guards down, ambulance is on its way.

588
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,730
我们说话这会儿正在清空大楼
We're clearing the building as we speak.

589
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,420
借过
Excuse me.

590
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,160
各层疏散的怎么样了
What's the status on those floor evacuations?

591
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,940
你什么打算
So what are you thinking?

592
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,260
浑水摸鱼
Diversion, then extraction.

593
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,290
那就是你负责去摸鱼  我负责搅浑水
So if you're the extraction, I'm the diversion?

594
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,750
你让我怎么搅啊
What do you need me to do?

595
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,900
伙计  我来调查本区的一起绑架案
Hey, buddy -- I'm working an abduction in the area.

596
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,660
你看到可疑情况了吗
You see anything suspicious?

597
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,750
抱歉  警探  没看到
Sorry, Detective, I haven't,

598
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,480
我一上午都在巡逻
and I've been on the beat all morning.

599
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,110
我没允许你离开  警官
I didn't excuse you, Officer.

600
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,130
-什么  -你怎么回事  菜鸟吗
- What? - What are you, a probie?

601
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,530
我说话时你放尊重点
Have a little respect when I talk.

602
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,920
抱歉  长官  我什么也没看到
I'm sorry, Sir. I haven't seen anything.

603
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,970
我也希望能帮上您
Wish I could help.

604
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,390
报上你的名字  你的编号
I want your name, your badge,

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,620
我不知道你干嘛找我麻烦  警探
I don't know why you're breaking my balls, Detective.

610
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,580

611
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,190
马上把证件拿出来
I want some ID right now.

612
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,590

咱虽独臂客  仍是西部第一快枪手
Even with one arm, I'm still the fastest gun in the west.

618
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,320
我在偷看那个卖空的服务器
Well, I was snooping around the short seller server.

619
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,410
简直是个大金矿啊

奥利弗・威尔德签过字的私人医疗表格

621

太有意思了
This is fun.

623
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,440
你和约翰就天天干这个啊
This is what you and John do all day long?

624
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,800
肯定内部有人告知了韦斯利
Someone on the inside must've told Wesley

625
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,120
关于手术的事情
about the surgery.

626
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,740
谁会事先知道呢
Who would've known in advance?

627
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,780
整件事应该是高度机密  对吧
This whole thing was supposed to be a big secret, right?

628
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,810
威尔德公司里知道这项手术的人

629

了解这些错综复杂

638

你和麦蒂现在非常危险
You and Maddy are in a lot of danger right now,

641

642
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,090
我不明白你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

643
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,990
有摄像头在监视你
There are cameras watching you.

644

我可以引导你离开公园
I can direct you out of the park,

645
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,830
悄悄地不惊动那些坏人

646
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,020
但你必须跟我保持通话
but you need to stay on that phone,

647
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,730

里瑟先生  根据麦蒂的时间表
Mr. Reese, according to Maddy's timetable,

两分钟内尼克・威尔德的动脉就危险了

她听不到我们
She can't hear us.

我不知道她在计划什么

661
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,590
但你必须告诉我们的朋友
but you have to tell our friend.

662
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,040
那计划太大  我阻止不了
Whatever it is, it's big, and I can't stop it.

663
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,820
你为了盗取身份混进公司而杀人
You killed a man for his ID to get inside that company,

664
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,450
然后又对保安开枪

为什么

她已成亡命之徒  在孤注一掷

她不会允许的
She won't let you.

673
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,550
她  她是谁
She--who is she?

674
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,350
莱恩斯先生  我们没多少时间了

请不要急着联系你的英国朋友
And please, don't contact your British friend

676

682
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,220

688

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,810
一般情况下  我就直接办了

无论结果如何  你的选择是对的

是你
It was you.

-你制造的伤口  -不

你才是主刀  医生  我只是护士

我给他注射了硫酸鱼精蛋白
I gave him protamine sulfate

758
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,300
以恢复凝血
to coagulate his blood again...

759
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,920
我得让他的心脏恢复跳动
But I'm gonna have to restart his heart,

760
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,450
这从体外可无法进行
and I won't be able to do that from the outside.

761
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,900
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

762

That's it-- I need you to pull with a lot of pressure, okay?

我来负责乳内动脉胸骨牵开器
I'm gonna take this Finochietto retractor.

767

Just keep it pulled.

769
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,010
我做不到
I don't think I can--

770
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,200
你能行
You can do it.

771
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,330
得把大量的血吸干净  才能找到动脉

我先夹住这个
I'm going to clamp this now.

775
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,830

Suture it later to stop the arterial bleeding.
