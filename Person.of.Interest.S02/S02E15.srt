162
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,430
肯定是走错过路了

163
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,410
是啊  错得多了  我都懒得数了
Yeah, I stopped counting awhile back.

164
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,750
你自己现在的工作也够麻烦
Well you're in for a rough gig yourself.

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,930
我们那位天才经理
Our brilliant manager

166
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,310
本来应该雇四个行李员
should have staffed four bellhops.

167
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,400
但却只有你和兰迪
Instead, it's just you and Randy,

168
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,460
而他抽烟的时间比他搬行李的时间多
and he takes more smoke breaks than he does luggage.

169
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,200
你似乎对这里的情况很内行啊

酒店管理不容易  但也没多高深莫测

科索沃战争的幸存者

180
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,550
我还以为那场战争的难民都是阿尔巴尼亚人

181
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,770
大部分是  但战争双方都遭受了损失
Most were, but both sides suffered losses.

182
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,460
鉴于米拉独自一人
Seeing as how Mira came alone,

183
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,110
我们只能认为  不论她之前的家庭如何
we can only assume that whatever family she had

184
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,110
现在都没有了

当时她16岁
She was 16 at the time.

186
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,290

这是中城区地图

-从这里开始挺好  -多谢

191

我黑进了安保网络
I managed to hack into the security network

192
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,000
通过他们的信号
and piggyback on their feeds,

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,280
我能查看酒店所有的摄像头
allowing me access to all the hotel's cameras.

194
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,410

女洗手间在那边
The ladies' is around--

男士的在另一边

警察问起了我们的  副业
Police were asking questions about our little side operation.

200
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,400
我在想  他们怎么会
It got me thinking about how they knew

201
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,510
想到来打探消息
to poke around in the first place.

202
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,710
-不是我  -当然不是
- It--it wasn't me. - No.

203
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,050
你不会傻到做出这种事
You're not stupid enough to do a thing like that

204
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,290
因为你知道  如果查出是你  我会有多愤怒
because you know how upset I would be if I found out it was you.

205
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,320
当然

离开里克岛监狱花的时间比我预想得长
Getting out of Rikers took longer than I anticipated.

他去的地方  通常都会有乱子

00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,080
测谎仪其实测不出谎言
You know, polygraphs don't detect lies,

313
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,720
只是显示生理反应
just physiological responses.

314
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,250
试试在问到基线问题时撒谎
Try lying on one of the baseline questions,

315
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,750
这样或许能骗过测试仪
it might trick the test into thinking

316
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,330
把你的所有话都当正常
that everything you say is normal.

317
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,060
好吧  不过是机器而已  是吧
Yeah, it's just a machine, right?

318
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,790
能有多聪明呢
I mean, how smart can it be?

319
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,260
没错  机器而已
Exactly. Just a machine.

320
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,160
与此同时  为你着想
In the meantime, it might be wise for you

321
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,410
约翰和我就暂时先不联系你了
to steer clear of John and myself, just for the time being.

322
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,670
好  这主意不错
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

323
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,470
谢了
Thanks.

324
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,080
看来德里克确实在经营卖淫服务
Looks like Derek is running an escort service.

325
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,450
如果是米拉告发了他  他可能就是威胁
If Mira called in the tip, he might be our threat.

326
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,140
快点确定  我们快点回家
The sooner we can confirm it, the sooner we can go home.

327
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,010
清理房间
Housekeeping.

328
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,060
不好意思  我们不用
Sorry, we don't need service.

329
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,530
我妻子忘记挂牌子了
My wife forgot to put the sign out.

330
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,460
没问题
No problem.

331
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,930
清理房间
Housekeeping.

332
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,650
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

333
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,770
现在不行
I can't now.

334
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,300
你知道这事不能等
You know this can't wait.

335
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,090
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

336
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,630
米拉刚刚被3215房间的客人叫去了
Mira's just been summoned into room 3215 by a guest.

337
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,740
查尔斯・哈里斯
Charles Harris.

338
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,260
米拉好像不太高兴见到他
She didn't look particularly happy to see him.

339
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,880
你肯定累坏了  整天帮人提包
You must be exhausted, dropping bags off all day.

340
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,300
根据他的账单
According to his hotel bill,

341
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,890
哈里斯先生喝的比吃的多
Mr. Harris drinks more than he eats,

342
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,000
我们没法知道房间里的情况
and we have no way of knowing what's going on in the room

343
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,180
米拉把手机留在推车里了
because Mira left her phone on her cart.

344
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
你往上三个楼层就能找到她
She's three floors above you.

345
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,340
你的客房服务到几点
How late do you deliver room service?

346
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,720
酒店的客房服务到
I believe the hotel delivers room service--

347
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,210
我不要酒店的
I'm not talking about the hotel.

348
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,300
我要你的
I'm talking about you.

349
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
欢迎来我房间
Feel free to drop yourself off...

350
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,350
随时
anytime.

351
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,560
失陪
Excuse me.

352
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,540
我在32楼了
I'm on the 32nd floor now.

353
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,200
别逼我  哈里斯
Don't try to push me, Harris.

354
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
可你得听听理由
But you need to listen to reason.

355
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,860
你怎么会指望我答应这种事
How can you expect me to agree to this?

356
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,750
因为这是正义的事
Because it's the right thing to do.

357
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,150
说来容易
Easy for you to say.

358
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,630
下次记得敲门
Next time, damn well knock.

359
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,650
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

360
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,460
我是来检查酒柜的
I was checking the minibar.

361
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,320
我来替你省省麻烦  酒柜空了
I'll save you the trouble. It's empty.

362
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,550
我们以后再谈
We'll talk later.

363
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,980
布洛兹女士  布洛兹女士
Ms. Brozi, Ms. Brozi!

364
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,140
请考虑一下
Please reconsider.

365
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,390
你是怎么回事
What's your problem?

366
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,000
这是你第二次跟踪我  闯进房间了
That's the second time you've walked in on me.

367
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,150
是德里克  对不对  他让你跟踪我
It's Derek, isn't it? He has you following me around.

368
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,840
你跟他之间有麻烦吗
Are you in some kind of trouble with him?

369
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,690
我知道他在酒店经营应召女郎生意
I know he's running girls out of here.

370
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,140
我还知道你牵涉其中
I also know you're involved.

371
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,690
我只清扫房间  这是我的工作
I clean the rooms, that's my job.

372
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,070
我工作很辛苦
I've worked too hard

373
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,540
没精力牵扯那些低级下流的事
to get involved in some sleazy scheme.

374
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,420
所以你就报警举报吗
Is that why you tipped off the police?

375
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,640
这不关你的事
That's none of your business.

376
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,790
刚那个酒鬼是怎么回事  我听到你嚷嚷了
What about the booze hound in there? I heard the yelling.

377
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,880
他不会伤害我的  没什么
He's harmless. It was nothing.

378
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,600
你确定吗  杜布瑞卡女士 
Are you sure about that, Ms. Dobrica?

379
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,420
或者我该叫你布洛兹
Or is that "Brozi"?

380
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,040
你对我一无所知
You know nothing about me,

381
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,690
你不知道我的见闻  我的经历
what I've seen, what I've been through.

382
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,240
我不需要帮忙  特别是不需要你这样的人帮
I don't need help, especially from someone like you.

383
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,280
离我远点  懂了吗
Just stay away from me, got it?

384
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,930
酒店的牛排餐厅很不错  不过
We do have a good steakhouse here in the hotel, but...

385
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,340
我个人推荐格兰德餐厅
personally, I'd recommend the Grand.

386
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,510
全城最好的肋眼牛排  你们不会失望的
Best rib eye in town. You will not be disappointed.

387
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,290
我帮你们预定七点半的座吧
Shall I put you down for 7:30?

388
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,450
-当然  谢谢  -好的
- Sure, thanks. - Okay.

389
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,570
我调查了一下那位客人
I've been researching our guest.

390
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,450
查尔斯・哈里斯是名自由记者
Charles Harris is a freelance journalist

391
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,330
为好几家知名媒体工作
working with a number of respected publications.

392
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,330
他对各国领导人有非常强烈的个人观点
He's the kind of writer that has strong opinions about world leaders,

393
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,020
导致有半数国家都不欢迎他
making him persona non grata in a half dozen countries.

394
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,420
他为什么对米拉感兴趣
What's his interest in Mira?

395
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,540
不清楚  可他如此费心来找米拉
Not sure, but if he came all this way to talk to her,

396
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,650
米拉可能是他的消息来源
she might be some kind of source.

397
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,850
一位姑娘去国离乡改名换姓
A girl who flees her country and changes her name

398
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,550
肯定是不希望别人找到自己
is someone who doesn't want to be found.

399
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,710
可如果她是在躲藏  又是在躲谁呢
But if she's hiding, who's she hiding from?

400
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,730
那个穿着高领衫的男人
That guy in the turtleneck.

401
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,240
从我们来时他就一直坐那儿
He's been sitting there since we arrived.

402
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,950
你见他起身过吗
Have you seen him move at all?

403
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,600
-应该没有  -没错
- I don't believe so. - Yeah, well,

404
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,740
那个位置对前台和入口一览无遗
he's got a clear line of sight of the front desk and the entrance.

405
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,750
可能是在等人
Might be waiting for somebody.

406
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,280
如果不是呢
And if he's not?

407
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,000
那他还能是干什么呢
Then what's he still doing here?

408
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,380
你觉得我们要怎么查呢
How do you suggest we find out?

409
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,180
在看什么呢
What ya readin'?

410
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,600
没什么  我来时这书就在了
Nothing, it was here when I sat down.

411
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,200
好吧
Good.

412
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,910
真受不了那些飞机白痴
Can't stand these airplane nuts.

413
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,320
空中钩取是
I mean, the pickup--

414
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,290
天呐  真对不起
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

415
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,530
-对不起  -没事的
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

416
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,530
没事  没事
It's okay, it's fine.

417
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,080
-对不起  -别放在心上
- I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it.

418
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,690
他在跟谁说话
Who's he talking to?

419
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,900
调出楼下的监控
Pull up the downstairs feeds.

420
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,890
看酒吧那个男人
Watch the man at the bar.

421
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,570
侧门的那个人接替了他的位置
The man at the side entrance is taking his place.

422
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,340
他们是监视者
They're spotters.

423
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,010
他们在轮换位置  以弥补监视缺口
They're rotating positions to patch the gaps in their surveillance.

424
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,200
军事侦察战略
Military recon tactic.

425
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,610
这是个杀手分队  芬奇
It's a hit squad, Finch.

426
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,840
至少现在能肯定我们找到了
At least it's safe to say that we found

427
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,000
针对米拉的真正威胁
the real threat to Mira.

428
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,860
可谁会派一队受过军事训练的杀手
Who would send a hit squad with military training

429
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,140
来杀一个酒店女佣呢
to kill a hotel maid?

430
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,080
监视者下楼去了  芬奇
Our spotter is headed back downstairs, Finch.

431
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,220
米拉在哪儿
Where's Mira?

432
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,350
她在厨房休息
She's in the kitchen, taking a break.

433
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,530
那我去检查一下他的房间
Well, I'm going to check out his room.

434
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,220
房客登记的名字是彼得・克雷格
That room is registered to a Peter Krieg,

435
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
用的是德国护照
Checked in under a German passport.

436
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,650
应该是假身份
Could be a forged identity.

437
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,160
我们得查出是谁派他们来的
We need to know who sent the team.

438
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,910
哈里斯那边有什么进展吗
Any new information on Harris?

439
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,120
我看见他的笔记本登陆了酒店无线网
I see that his laptop is signed onto the hotel Wi-Fi.

440
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,380
只要我绕过防火墙
If I can get past his firewall,

441
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,540
就能看到他对米拉的采访笔记
I can see what kind of notes he has on Mira.

442
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,860
监视者有一份哈里斯的档案
Our spotter has a file on Harris.

443
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,720
不管是因为什么
Whatever's going on,

444
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,390
一定与哈里斯写的系列报道有关
it has to do with a series of articles Harris wrote

445
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,640
都是针对塞尔维亚上校卢德克・彼得洛维奇的
about a Serbian Colonel named Rudko Petrovic.

446
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,940
{\pos(102,75)}彼得洛维奇速写: 战争罪犯

447
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,580
这名字真耳熟
That name sounds familiar.

448
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,030
{\pos(102,75)}卢德克・彼得洛维奇: 圣人还是罪人

449
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,680
我记得他正在竞选副总理
I believe he's running for deputy prime minister.

450
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,210
哈里斯的文章全都在指控他
Harris all but accused him

451
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,370
在科索沃犯下了战争罪
of committing war crimes in Kosovo.

452
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,950
米拉怎么卷入这事的
How does Mira fit into all this?

453
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,400
我好像查到了
I think I just found out.

454
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,320
我进入了哈里斯的电脑
I'm in Harris's computer.

455
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,490
{\an8}阿尔巴尼亚出生证明

456
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,290
她真正的姓氏"布洛兹"
Not only is her real last name "Brozi",

457
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,200
她是阿尔巴尼亚人  不是塞尔维亚人
but she's ethnic Albanian, not Serbian.

458
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,800
根据哈里斯的采访笔记
According to Harris's notes,

459
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,490
米拉目击了彼得洛维奇
Mira witnessed Petrovic

460
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,810
下令处决她全家

461
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,850
这就是为什么她向移民局
It makes sense that she lied to immigration

462
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,370
谎报名字和种族
about her name and ethnicity,

463
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,910
她只想保护自己
she was simply protecting herself.

464
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,160
哈里斯找到了一位
And Harris found the one witness

465
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,290
能够扳倒上校的目击证人
who could bring down the colonel.

466
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,920
他们一定是跟踪着他到了酒店
They must have followed him to the hotel,

467
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,160
期望他和线人取得联系
hoping he would establish contact with his source.

468
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,380
只要他们认出了米拉就会行动
They'll make their move on Mira as soon as they identify her.

469
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,410
他们可能已经开始行动了
They may already have.

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,570
我们的支援几时到
What's the ETA on our backup?

Hi, give me a ginger ale.

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,900
看住他们  等会儿再处理
Keep an eye on them. We'll deal with those guys

477
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,650
我先把米拉送出去
after I get Mira out of here.

478
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,270
你就死不放手了  是吧
You just don't give up, do you?

479
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,870
约翰  侧门处那位行动了
John, the man at the side entrance is moving.

480
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
你就不能别管我吗
Why won't you just leave me alone?

481
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,870
这个理由充分吗
That a good enough reason?

482
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,290
他要杀我  因为我跟那记者谈过
He was going to kill me for talking to the journalist.

483
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,350
他要杀你  因为你知道
He was going to kill you for knowing

484
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,080
彼得洛维奇在科索沃对你家人的所作所为
what Petrovic did to your family in Kosovo.

485
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,120
那你是什么人呢
What does that make you?

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,740

似乎几分种前哈里斯先生
It seems that Mr. Harris remotely checked out of his room

515
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,020
远程退房结账了
a few minutes ago.

516
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,920
他不在这儿
He's not here.

517
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,750
有没有可能是其他女佣清理了房间
Any chance another maid cleaned this room?

518
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,350
今天不可能  这层楼是我负责的
Not today. This is my floor.

519

录了像  她说我能够指认上校
Made a tape of her saying I could identify the colonel.

532
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,980
她两周前被发现死亡
She was found dead two weeks ago,

533
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,220
可能就是因为跟记者谈过
probably from talking to the journalist.

534
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,160
他说如果我公之于众  就能保证自身安全
He said if I went public, it would ensure my safety,

535
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,410
但我拒绝了
but I refused.

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,470
我要把你送出去  米拉
I'm gonna get you out of here, Mira,

539

但我得知道他们是怎么找到你的

你把和哈里斯谈话的事情告诉其他人了吗
Did you tell anyone you were talking with Harris?

541
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,500
没  谁也没说
No, nobody.

542
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,070

Then how could they have known you were the witness?
