这次我们为什么无法及时阻止

我们开始一起巡逻出警

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,180
不  口服才会致命
No, it's only lethal if ingested

314
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,710
一小时内得不到救治就会死
and you don't get treated within the first hour.

315
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,220
整个区域都有污染
Well, the area's contaminated,

316
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,140
但并不像是源头
but it doesn't appear to be the point of origin.

317
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,940
尼尔森怎么样
What's Nelson's condition?

318
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,890
马上就知道了
I'm about to find out.

319
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,650
你  不  你是那服务员
You. No, you're that waiter.

320
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,350
这事跟你有关
You had something to do with this.

321
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,360
我不是服务员  是来帮你的
I'm not a waiter. I'm here to help you.

322
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,990
但你在招待会上
But you were at the reception.

323
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,450
你往酒里放东西了
You slipped something into my drink.

324
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,770
不  我没有  是别人
No, I didn't, but someone else did.

325
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,370
我是想救你
I was supposed to save you,

326
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,120
但是来迟了
but I was too late.

327
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,920
你服下去了钋  医生
You've ingested polonium, Doctor.

328
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,420
就要死了
You're dying.

329
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,090
真是疯了  怎么  你是谁
This is insane. How do--who are you?

330
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,670
鼻血  黄疸  脱发
Nosebleeds, jaundice, hair falling out.

331
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,110
是辐射中毒
It's radiation poisoning.

332
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,700
我知道辐射对人体的影响
I'm aware how radiation affects the body,

333
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,780
但你怎么知道的
but how do you know all this?

334
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,640
你几个小时前中的毒
You were poisoned a few hours ago,

335
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,870
也就是说  24小时之内
which means, in less than 24 hours,

336
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,180
你就会死
you will be dead.

337
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,710
抱歉  医生
I'm sorry, Doctor.

338
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,330
我  我不明白
I-I don't understand.

339
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,530
怎么
How--

340
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,250
谁会要我死
Who would want me dead?

341
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,070
你应该比我清楚
You would know better than I.

342
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,950
现在你可以躺在床上坐以待毙
Look, you can stay there and die in that bed,

343
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,110
或者跟我出去找到那个害死你的混蛋
or you can get up and help me find the bastard who murdered you.

344
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,310
时间不多了  医生
Clock's ticking, Doc.

345
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,140
是谁  我要知道
Who was it? I need to know.

346
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,740
首先解决私事
First we need to get your affairs in order.

347
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,030
你说得对  我要见我女儿
You're right. I need to see my daughter.

348
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,170
感谢你们的关注  感谢大家
Thank you for your interest. Thanks, guys.

349
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,080
-希望你能帮助我们  -莫莉  莫莉
- Hope you can make it to our benefit. - Molly? Molly?

350
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,350
能跟你说句话吗
Can I have a word with you?

351
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,120
她不想跟你说话
She doesn't want to talk to you.

352
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,050
让我来处理  好吗
I can handle it, okay?

353
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,220
大老远跑来骂我吗
Came all the way down here just to chew me out, huh?

354
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,490
还以为你要飞到什么地方参加研讨会呢
Thought you were jetting off to some seminar or something.

355
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,270
不  莫莉  我不是来吵架的
No, Molly, I didn't come here to argue.

356
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,270
我只想看看你好不好
I just came to see if you were okay.

357
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,630
真的吗
Really?

358
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,300
是啊  你妈妈说你要拍什么纪录片
Yeah, your mom said you're making some kind of documentary.

359
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,280
需要帮忙吗  需要钱或者别的吗
Do you need any help? Do you need money or anything?

360
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,430
你还好吗
Are you feeling okay?

361
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,940
脸色有点苍白
You look a little pale.

362
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
没事  我挺好  挺好
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

363
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,780
我  我就是想来说一下
I-I just stopped by to say,

364
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,270
我很抱歉
I'm sorry for...

365
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,870
没有多花时间陪着你
not being more involved.

366
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,590
怎么  你指在我的生活中陪我  还是
What, like, in my life, or--

367
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,410
也许这是个错误  我不知道
Well, maybe this was a mistake, I don't know.

368
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,780
-我就是想  -你来干什么  爸爸
- I just wish-- - Why are you here, dad?

369
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,940
我知道我一直没陪伴你
Look, I know that I haven't been more available

370
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,940
总是工作为重
and putting my work first.

371
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,410
可能你妈妈也是因此离开的
That's probably why your mother left.

372
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,320
妈妈离开是因为你出轨
Mom left because you cheated on her.

373
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,490
我的又一错误
Another mistake.

374
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,410
但有个女儿不是错误
But the one that I didn't make was having a daughter.

375
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,970
今天早些时候  人们向我祝贺
Earlier today when people were congratulating me

376
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,490
我所取得的成就
about my accomplishments,

377
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,170
我在想的是
I-I was thinking that the thing

378
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,520
我最引以为豪的  是你
that I'm most proud of is you.

379
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,970
我就想说这些
That's all I came to say.

380
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,020
我明天打给你  爸爸
I'll call you tomorrow, dad.

381
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,100
当然  好的
Yeah, sure. Good.

382
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,940
我很期待
I would like that.

383
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,840
一开始  我想不清楚
At first, I couldn't figure it out.

384
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,460
斯蒂尔斯和阿扎雷洛在缉毒组工作
Stills and Azarello working Narcotics,

385
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,600
杀死毒贩  偷走藏毒
bumping dealers, stealing their stash.

386
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,910
{\pos(232,118)}复制手机

387
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,910
{\pos(215,161)}强制配对
约瑟夫・索里亚诺

388
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,910
{\pos(207,184)}完成

389
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,630
想着他们早晚会失手
Figured eventually they'd slip.

390
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,370
然后我灵光一现
Then it hit me.

391
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,890
他们里边安排了人  以防万一
They had a man on the inside, in case they made a mistake.

392
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,650
我听不懂
I don't follow.

393
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,750
他们需要在凶案组有内线
They needed somebody in Homicide.

394
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,990
你在51局的老朋友阿扎雷洛
Your old pal Azarello from the 51st,

395
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,930
他向我们招了
he clued us in.

396
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,240
告诉我  你们的团伙是怎么运行的
So tell me, how did your crew operate?

397
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,180
按部就班
Like clockwork.

398
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,740
先是斯蒂尔斯  他发现目标
First Stills, he got the drop on a honey pot.

399
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,360
我去打探情况  确保安全
I'd scope it out, make sure it was still hot.

400
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,210
然后开工
You know, then we'd roll up,

401
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,230
亮出警徽  抢走钱财毒品
flash the silver, and help ourselves to the money and the dope.

402
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,010
要是出了差错
But if things went south,

403
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,660
就叫弗斯科来处理
that's when Fusco came in.

404
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,020
阿扎雷洛就是个满口胡诌的货
Azarello's a lying piece of crap.

405
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,520
细节决定成败  弗斯科
The devil's always in the details, Fusco.

406
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,350
-跟我说说第一次  -我一辈子都不会忘
- Tell me about the first time. - I'll never forget.

407
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,730
那是在皇后区一间老鼠肆虐的房间里
It was some rat-infested tenement over in Queens.

408
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,780
你叫我过来干什么
Why you gotta bring me down here?

409
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,640
直接上报就行了
You just gotta call it in.

410
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,040
拜托  莱奈尔  你知道事儿容易出问题
Come on, Lionel, you know how these things can go sideways.

411
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,010
只需要凶案组帮点小忙
Just need a little help from Homicide here.

412
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,990
天
Jeez.

413
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,890
我刚开始搬  这蠢货就要逃跑
As soon as I started lifting, this dumb bastard tried to run.

414
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,990
我别无选择  他们要坑死我
I mean, I had no choice. They're gonna have my nuts here.

415
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,680
冷静  不会有事的
Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.

416
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,640
在床头柜里找到了那玩意儿
Found that piece in the nightstand.

417
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,760
我们得赶在内务部的人来之前考虑好对策
We gotta figure out all the angles before IAB shows up.

418
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,190
你想让我帮你掩护
You're asking me to cover this?

419
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,640
我要完蛋了
I'm gonna be screwed.

420
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,240
过来  有问题吗
Come here. What's the problem?

421
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,800
我以为我们之间能相互支持
I thought we had each other's back.

422
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,670
是的  但你的要求实在
Yeah, but what you're asking me here is--

423
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,720
你有难时  是谁陪着你
When you needed somebody, who was there for you?

424
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,990
是谁支持你
Who had your back?

425
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,450
看看这个人渣
Look at this scumbag.

426
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,840
没准儿还卖过K粉给小孩儿
Probably slings to kids K through eight.

427
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,010
-怎么说  -我不知道
- What do you say? - I don't know.

428
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,750
为了朋友
For a friend.

429
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,610
站在那边  对着墙开两枪  齐胸高
Stand over there, put two in the wall, chest high.

430
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,210
然后是来是往  不管怎样都是正当防卫
Then, coming or going, either way, it's self-defense.

431
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,150
要擦干净
And wipe it down.

432
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,510
就这样
That's it.

433
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,160
谢了  莱奈尔
Thanks, Lionel.

434
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,200
瞧瞧这是哪阵风吹的
Look what the cat dragged in.

435
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
我最爱的逮捕警官
My favorite arresting officer.

436
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
气色不错  警探
Looking good, Detective.

437
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,660
别废话  阿扎雷洛
Skip it, Azarello.

438
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,790
你进监狱都一年多了
Look, you've been in jail for over a year.

439
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,920
为什么突然跟内务部说起弗斯科的事
Why all of a sudden you talking to IAB about Fusco?

440
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,750
也许我们是有规则的  警探
Maybe we got a code, Detective.

441
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,670
也许弗斯科违反了规则
Maybe Fusco violated it.

442
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,170
也许问题是你为什么现在才问起
Maybe the question should be why you're just now bringing up

443
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,740
你搭档的过去
your partner's past?

444
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,820
那真是绚丽多彩
It's pretty colorful.

445
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,930
我还以为弗斯科掌握了你的艳照啥的
I thought Fusco had some dirty pictures of you or something.

446
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,620
死了两名警察  失踪了两名
Two dead cops. Two missing.

447
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,170
这是HR的回归之作吗
Is this HR's idea of a comeback?

448
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,910
秘密很难埋藏
Secrets are hard to bury.

449
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,360
有时
And sometimes...

450
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,630
尸体总会露出来
bodies have a way of showing up.

451
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,530
我告诉你
Tell you what.

452
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,100
你帮我的忙  我会跟地检官谈谈
You help me out, I'll talk to the DA.

453
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,010
也许可以帮你因行为良好减刑
Maybe he shaves some time off for good behavior, huh?

454
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,310
你笑起来很好看  知道吗
You got a nice smile, you know that?

455
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,280
但现在想交易已经迟了  警探
But you're a little late to the deal-making party, Detective.

456
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,090
失陪了  我和袜子有个约会
If you'll excuse me, I got a date with a sock.

457
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,350
里克岛监狱之行收获如何  警探
How did it go at Rikers, Detective?

458
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,800
不怎么样  不过你要查的人  我倒是有发现
Not so good, but I did find something on one of your names.

459
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,470
那个资产经理  布兰登・博伊德
The asset manager, Brandon Boyd.

460
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,010
他是一家对冲基金的操盘手

461
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,580
VAC资本  我知道
VAC Capital, I'm aware.

462
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,190
你知道他们正在被证监会调查吗
Are you aware they're under SEC investigation?

463
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,440
内幕交易
Insider trading.

464
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,200
就在他们抛售了某家大型制药集团的股票之后
After they dumped some big pharmaceutical stock.

465
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,560
我猜猜  菲利亚制药
Let me guess. Philia Pharmaceuticals.

466
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,450
我在证监会的联系人认为
My contact at the SEC thinks

467
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,390
VAC资本

468
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,390
{\an1}文森特・科克伦

469
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,390
{\an1}创办人及执行总裁

470
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,840
他们得到了某个药物试验的消息
they got a tip on some drug trial.

471
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,900
这个有用吗
Does that help?

472
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,530
不幸的是  有用
Unfortunately, yes, it does.

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,480
-听说过VAC资本吗  -当然
- Ever heard of VAC Capital? - Yeah, sure.

474
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,740
他们管理我的资金
They manage my money.

475
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,080
他们正在被证监会调查内幕交易
They under SEC investigation for insider trading.

476
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
内幕交易  关于什么
Insider trading? On what?

477
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,490
你告诉过布兰登・博伊德有项药物试验即将失败吗
Did you tell Brandon Boyd that a drug trial was about to fail?

478
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,260
什么  我不知道  可能在俱乐部提过
What? I don't know. Maybe at the club.

479
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,050
他转头就利用这个消息
He turned around and used that information

480
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,080
做空菲利亚的股票
to bet against Philia stock,

481
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,000
赚了五亿
made $500 million.

482
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,260
王八蛋  五个亿
Son of a bitch. $1/2 billion dollars?

483
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,520
因为你的消息
Off your tip.

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,150
是你走漏的风声  医生
You're the leak, Doc.

485
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,300
正在被调查吗
There's an investigation?

486
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,360
他们还未找到内线
They don't know the insider yet.

487
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,840
我猜VAC资本打算维持住这一点
I'm guessing VAC Capital plans to keep it that way.

488
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,130
他们就想杀我
Instead they killed me?

489
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,040
你是包袱  你必须死
You're the liability. You had to go.

490
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,550
我是医生
I'm a doctor.

491
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,960
人们总是向我咨询  问我建议
People ask me things all the time, advice.

492
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,140
那种药物啊  这种食谱啊
You know, that drug and this diet and--

493
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,050
这都是借口
It's just an excuse.

494
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,680
我做错了
What I did was wrong,

495
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,640
现在我要死了
and now I'm a dead man.

496
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,550
都是因为我大嘴巴
All because I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

497
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
你是犯了错
You made a mistake.

498
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,450
那不意味着你该死
That doesn't mean you deserve to die.

499
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,310
你说得对
You're right.

500
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,770
我得找博伊德谈谈
I need to talk to Boyd.

501
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,910
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese,

502
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,830
我想毒源已经找到了
I believe I've located the origin of the poisoning.

503
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,970
典礼讲台上的水被下了毒
It came from water placed on the podium at his ceremony.

504
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,480
当时的服务员只有两人
There were only two people on that service staff.

505
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,010
我和一位女服务员
Me and a waitress.

506
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,930
我想我知道她的雇主是谁
And I think I know who hired her.

507
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,170
该去找那名操盘手了
Time to go track down a trader.

508
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,370
-票  先生  -马上
- Ticket, Sir. - Right away.

509
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,890
好  查出持股份额后给我打电话
All right, so call me about the hold on those shares.

510
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,010
还有那个巴西性感模特的电话号码
And the number of that hot Brazilian model, huh?

511
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,730
回见  老板
Later, boss.

512
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,530
你的车  先生
Your car, Sir.

513
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,870
要小费[建议]吗
You want a tip?

514
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,900
没签婚前协议千万别结婚
Never get hitched without a prenup.

515
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,020
有个更好的建议
Here's a better one.

516
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,730
千万别上陌生人的车
Don't get in the car with strangers.

517
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,520
尼尔森医生  这是怎么回事
Dr. Nelson. What's going on here?

518
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,970
我的时间所剩无几了
I don't have a lot of time.

519
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,590
如果你回答错误就会跟我一样
And neither do you, if you answer me wrong.

520
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,220
你在俱乐部认识我
You met me at the club,

521
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,770
你拉我成了你的客户
you took me on as a client,

522
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,440
你装作是我朋友
and you pretended to be my friend.

523
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,140
我告诉了你那个药物试验
And I told you about a drug trial,

524
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,840
而你回过头来  捅了我一刀
and you turned around, and you burned me!

525
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,820
等下  我是操盘手
Wait a sec. I am a trader.

526
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,460
这是我的工作  操盘交易
That's all I do. I trade.

527
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,220
是的  你引发了证监会的调查
Yeah, and you triggered an SEC investigation.

528
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,220
在他们找到我之前  你给我下了毒
And before they found me, you poisoned me.

529
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,830
什么
What?

530
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,520
各位
Guys.

531
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
我对此毫不知情
I don't know anything about that.

532
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,030
-不知情吗  -你赶快停车
- No, huh? - Look, you should really just pull over now--

533
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,930
慢着  你不明白
Hold on. You don't understand.

534
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,600
老板分分钟盯着我
The boss is on my ass, 24/7.

535
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,800
你要么搞到"黑幕"  要么滚蛋
Either you get black edge, or you're out.

536
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,530
"黑幕"
Black edge?

537
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,660
就是内部消息  无人知晓的  确定无疑的
Inside information that no one else has, that's beyond doubt.

538
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,560
我们的钱全押在那药上
We were all-in on that drug,

539
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,400
我得找到与试验相关的人
but I needed to find someone on the trial.

540
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,280
要么搞到"黑幕"赚到大钱
Either you get that edge and turn big profits,

541
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,850
要么[星战角色]黑武士爆你蛋蛋
or Lord Vader cuts your balls off.

542
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,420
你就是为此接近我的吗
So that's why you recruited me?

543
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,620
我得占这便宜  而你想加入大型对冲基金
I needed that advantage, and you wanted in to a big hedge fund.

544
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,490
但我发誓这事跟我没关系
But I swear I had nothing to do with--

545
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,160
但你今天参加典礼了
But you were at the ceremony today.

546
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,840
对  我老板要求我定期去
Yeah, boss man said to go about my regular schedule.

547
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,090
你老板是指文森特・科克伦吗
By "boss man", you mean Vincent Cochran?

548
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,730
我已经说得够多了
Look, I've said enough already.

549
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,000
是的  文森特・科克伦
Yes! Vincent Cochran.

550
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,360
-你跟他提过我  -我不说不行
- And you told him about me? - I had to.

551
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,210
我们被调查  他询问我们是否已暴露
We got investigated. He asked if we'd been exposed.

552
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,770
-他说他会处理的  -科克伦现在在哪
- Said he'd take care of it. - Where's Cochran now?

553
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,410
你似乎没明白
You don't seem to understand.

554
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,510
你可不想惹上他
This is not a man you want to cross.

555
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,380
我告诉过你我视力下降得很厉害吗
Have I told you that my eyesight is failing?

556
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,390
好吧  度假屋
Okay! The lodge!

557
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,330
温德克赖斯特  州北
The Windcrest! Upstate!

558
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,690
我得跟卡特说句话
I need to talk to Carter.

559
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,770
我的孩子在等人接去训练
I need to have my kid picked up for practice.

560
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,060
先回答几个问题再说
As soon as you answer a few questions.

561
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,730
知道吗  弗斯科  不久前
You know, Fusco, it wasn't long ago

562
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,770
我也是便衣警探
that I was a plain clothes detective.

563
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,370
-真的吗  -真的
- No kidding. - No kidding.

564
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,500
但你知道你我之间的不同之处吗
But you know what the difference is between me and you?

565
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,930
-什么  -我没杀过人
- What's that? - I never murdered people.

566
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,310
我知道你不止为那帮家伙掩护
See, I know you weren't just covering for those guys.

567
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,530
你就是其中之一
You were one of them.

568
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,040
一旦进去  就别想回头
Once you get a taste of that, there's no looking back.

569
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,880
弗斯科  快进来
Fusco, get in here.

570
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,360
-搞什么名堂  -弗斯科  怎么啦
- Oh, for crying out loud. - Fusco, what's wrong?

571
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,130
一点血腥味都受不了吗
Can't stand the sight of a little blood?

572
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,730
别闹了  他好着呢
Hey, knock it off. He's good.

573
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,130
你拿一袋  这里多得是
Grab a bag. We got a big haul here.

574
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,070
不了  谢了  都是你们的
No, thanks. This is all you guys.

575
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,580
我可不想参与
I don't want any part of this.

576
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,310
现在为时已晚了  不是吗
It's a little late for that, ain't it?

577
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,330
小心
Look out!

578
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,780
看到没  就知道你靠得住
You see there? I knew you were solid.

579
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,050
欢迎加入  莱奈尔
Welcome to the crew, Lionel.

580
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,960
好了  我们走
All right, let's get out of here.

581
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,070
快点  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

582
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,310
阿扎雷洛供出你了
Azarello flipped on you.

583
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,590
我们本以为斯蒂尔斯逃往了[南美]伯利兹
We thought Stills was halfway to Belize,

584
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,340
现在我们知道了并非如此
but now we know different.

585
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,190
你不得不除掉他
You got rid of him because you had to.

586
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,820
你只凭一名黑警的谎言
All you got is lies from a dirty cop.

587
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,200
在法庭上站不住脚
It'll never hold up in court.

588
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,520
你知道什么才能在法庭上站住脚吗
Well, you know what will hold up in court?

589
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,710
证据
Evidence.

590
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,470
当黑警们想要
You see, when dirty cops want

591
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,900
抹掉犯罪现场的DNA时
to eliminate DNA from a crime scene,

592
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,000
他们会使用漂白水
they use bleach.

593
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,450
但漂白水会有残留
But bleach stains things.

594
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,240
比如残留在车辆的地毯上  后备箱里
Like the carpet and the trunk of the vehicle

595
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,110
就是你在斯蒂尔斯失踪当天登记开出的车
that you signed out on the day that Stills disappeared.

596
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,500
不知道你在说什么
No idea what you're talking about.

597
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,010
你的电话记录
Your cell phone records.

598
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,290
就在斯蒂尔斯失踪当晚
You made a call from Oyster bay to your home

599
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,600
你从牡蛎湾打了一个电话回家
the very night that Stills went missing.

600
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,600
星期四半夜两点你为何会在牡蛎湾
Any reason you were in Oyster bay at 2:00 am on a Thursday?

601
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,930
考虑退休后去那里
Thinking about retiring out there.

602
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,650
想去看看地
Wanted to look at some land.

603
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,000
你还采集了土样
You take soil samples?

604
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,460
觉醒吧  朋友
Domain awareness, my friend.

605
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,020
卫星  改变了这个世界
Satellites, they're changing the world.

606
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,770
你挑个时间地点
You pick a time and place,

607
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,450
我们能给你发张青蛙屁股毛的照片
we send you a photo of the ass hairs on a frog,

608
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,450
或者这个  牡蛎湾被翻过的地
or in this case, disturbed plots of earth in Oyster bay.

609
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,700
是这四个中的哪一块  警探
Which of the four is it, Detective?

610
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,350
我有两打人员正在集结铲子
I got two dozen unis gathering shovels,

611
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,790
挖土机和寻尸犬
a backhoe, and cadaver dogs.

612
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,100
天一亮  我们就要去寻宝了
Come sunup, we're gonna go on a little treasure hunt.

613
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,600
别难为自己了
Make it easy on yourself.

614
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,440
直接说你把斯蒂尔斯埋在哪里了
Just tell me where you buried Stills.

615
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,440
我知道你杀死了他
I know you killed him,

616
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,480
就像杀死其他底层混混一样
just like those lowlifes.

617
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,770
你是个黑警  明天一早
You're a dirty cop, and come morning,

618
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,590
我就会挖出你的罪恶
I'm gonna dig up your sins.

619
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,830
想谈谈吗
You wanted to talk?

620
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,420
那个
So...

621
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,700
你之前问我的那些问题
the questions you asked me earlier--

622
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,920
我没有回答的那些
the ones I didn't answer.

623
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,470
我没有杀斯蒂尔斯
I didn't kill Stills,

624
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,700
但我还是会背上这罪名
but I'm gonna go down for it just the same.

625
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,330
但我活该  因为
But I deserve it because of--

626
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,550
因为
Because?

627
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,960
因为我做过别的坏事
Because of the other bad things I did.

628
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,510
我在51局工作时
You see, back at the 51st--

629
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,250
得  等等  什么叫"别的坏事"
All right, wait, what do you mean, "the other bad things"?

630
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,840
最初  我
See, at-- at first, I...

631
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,580
我以为我算替天行道  知道吗
I thought I was helping to clean up the streets, you know?

632
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,500
谁会在乎一个底层毒贩子的毒品钱呢
Who's gonna miss some drug money from a lowlife dealer?

633
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,080
接着演变成谁会在乎一个毒贩子呢
Then it became who's gonna miss the dealer?

634
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,360
我和  我和斯蒂尔斯  我们是朋友
Me and... me and Stills, we were friends.

635
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,440
他就像兄弟一样陪我  知道吗
He was there for me like a brother, you know?

636
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,580
支持我
He had my back.

637
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,450
后来
And then...

638
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,970
后来就发现自己陷入一种境地
then you find yourself in a situation,

639
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,840
一种不应该置身其中的不良境地
a bad situation that you shouldn't be in.

640
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,420
我杀过人  卡特
I killed people, Carter.

641
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,610
我曾是黑警
I was a dirty cop.

642
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,830
但  自从遇到你和我们的朋友
But, since I met you and our friends,

643
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,050
一切都变了
that's all changed.

644
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,790
我不再是过去的我了
I'm not that guy anymore.

645
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,650
你总跟我说  如果
You always told me that if--

646
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,240
如果我的过去又阴魂不散
that if my past came back around,

647
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,260
你不会替我掩护  我也不会要求你
you wouldn't cover for me, and I'm not asking you to.

648
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,110
我只希望你理解
I just need you to understand--

649
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,720
停下
Stop.

650
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,200
我不能
I can't.

651
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,330
我不想再听下去了
I don't want to hear any more.

652
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,770
我不认识你了  莱奈尔
I don't know who you are, Lionel.

653
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,350
医生  坚持住
Doc, stay with me.

654
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,540
就想当面见见杀我的那个混蛋
Just wanted to look the bastard who killed me in the face.

655
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,250
-不要放弃  -没事的
- Don't give up yet. - It's okay.

656
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,040
这是报应
It's time to face the consequences.

657
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,100
我们都会犯错
We all make mistakes.

658
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,560
我
I--

659
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,800
天  他是死了吗
Man, hey, did he just die?

660
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,410
天  他死了吗
Oh, man, is he dead?

661
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,850
闭嘴  否则下一个轮到你
Shut up, or you're next.

662
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,340
上帝啊  你不会是想
Oh, my God, you're not gonna--

663
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,770
拜托  拜托  拜托
Come on. Come on. Come on.

664
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,230
你还不能死
You can't die yet.

665
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,630
我们还有个任务要完成
We've got one more mission to finish.

666
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,100
来吧
Come on.

667
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

668
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,150
你不能把我扔在这儿傻站着
Hey, you can't just leave me standing out here.

669
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,750
你说得对
You're right.

670
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,040
认出我了吗  科克伦先生
You recognize me, Mr. Cochran?

671
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,430
我该认出吗
Should I?

672
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,020
我是被你谋杀的人
I'm the man you murdered.

673
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,200
弗斯科的事你打算怎么做
What are you doing about Fusco?

674
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,780
目前  不做  在忙
At the moment, nothing. I'm busy.

675
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,170
我们一起经历了这么多
After all we've been through,

676
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,320
我还以为他是你的朋友
I thought he was your friend.

677
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,270
我一直以为他是你的搭档
I always thought he was your partner.

678
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,120
他跟我说了那些事之后就不是了
Not after what he just told me.

679
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,850
你知道他做过什么吗
Do you know what he's done?

680
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,190
他应该被关进监狱
He deserves to be behind bars.

681
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,590
卡特  可从来没人请我当道德指导
Listen, Carter, no one's ever looked at me as the moral benchmark.

682
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,850
我看这决定你必须自己做
I guess you'll have to make that call yourself.

683
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,970
我是警察  好吗  但那是弗斯科
I'm a cop, okay? But it's Fusco.

684
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,730
并没那么容易
It's not as simple as that.

685
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,100
我一直以为对你来说很容易
I always thought it was in your book.

686
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,680
一朝是黑警  永远是黑警  是吧
Once a dirty cop, always a dirty cop, right?

687
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,200
失陪一下
You'll have to excuse me.

688
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,470
我得继续工作了
I have to get back to work.

689
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,440
你知道钋会对人体造成什么影响
You know what polonium does to the human body,

690
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,410
科克伦先生
Mr. Cochran?

691
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,480
我觉得你准备告诉我了
I have a feeling you're about to tell me.

692
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,770
钋一进入血液中
Once it enters the bloodstream,

693
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,350
就马上开始摧毁免疫系统
it immediately starts to break down the immune system.

694
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,630
渗入骨髓之中
It seeps into the bone marrow,

695
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,120
使你的身体无法抵挡自身的细菌
so your body can no longer fend off its own bacteria,

696
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,020
细菌就开始从内部吞噬你
which starts to eat you from the inside out.

697
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,160
攻击你的DNA
It attacks your DNA,

698
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,850
关闭你的内脏功能
shuts down your internal organs.

699
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,090
很快  不过我敢保证
It's fairly rapid, but I assure you,

700
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,470
异常痛苦
it's very painful.

701
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,020
真惊讶你还在这里
Amazing you're still here.

702
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,100
最后的二十四小时如同身临地狱
The last 24 hours have been a living hell.

703
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,390
真是邪恶的杀人方式
It's a truly diabolical way of killing someone.

704
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,880
不过我只是医生
But then I'm just a doctor.

705
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,050
对抗不了精明世故的
I'm no match for a shrewd,

706
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,920
国际对冲基金亿万富豪
international hedge fund billionaire.

707
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,950
也许你太低估自己了
Perhaps you sell yourself short.

708
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,570
不  我现在明白了
Oh, no, I get it now.

709
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,100
你和你的公司  你们真正感兴趣的不是
You and your firm, you're not really interested

710
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,630
医学药物和治愈疾病 
in medicinal drugs or curing disease.

711
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,210
你只想赚钱
You're just a man who makes money,

712
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,540
不择手段啊
even if you have to cheat, hmm?

713
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,070
我是投资者  我交易股票
I'm an investor. I trade stocks.

714
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,960
但如果我发现自己挑了垃圾股
But if I know I picked a loser,

715
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,840
就必须抛了
I have to dump it.

716
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,350
无论如何  我总是赢
Either way, I always win.

717
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,690
我做过好事  做过坏事
I've done some good things, some bad.

718
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,790
我曾毁了我的生活  我的名誉
I managed to ruin my life, my reputation.

719
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,180
但我并不该死
But I don't deserve to die.

720
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,590
证监会将会扳倒你的公司
And the SEC will bring your firm down.

721
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,000
不幸的是  医生
Unfortunately, Doctor,

722
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,930
证监会的调查将会伴你死去
the SEC investigation will die with you.

723
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,620
我想你说的是伴我们俩
I think you mean us.

724
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,410
你鼻子在流血
Your nose is bleeding.

725
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,280
你有九十亿
You have $9 billion,

726
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,000
却只有二十四小时来花了
but you only have 24 hours to spend it.

727
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,500
希望你明智投资
I hope you invest it wisely.

728
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,810
弃尸的好地方
Nice place to dump a body.

729
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,550
不过一点小雪挡不住警犬
But a little snow won't keep the dogs from finding it.

730
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,220
来吧  到结局了
Let's go. End of the line.

731
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,390
综合说来  身为一名警察
You know, at the end of the day, as a cop,

732
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,040
一般都处于这么一种境地
you're the sum of two sides of the ledger.

733
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,270
有人恨不得你完蛋
The people who want to see you go down

734
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,160
有人根本不鸟你
and the people who don't give a crap about you.

735
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,810
而现在  弗斯科  我认为根本没人鸟你
Now, Fusco, I don't think anyone gives a crap about you.

736
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,190
警探  这边
Detective, up this way.

737
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,590
来吧  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

738
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,750
别担心  亲爱的
Don't worry, honey.

739
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,300
会有其他人的  相信我
There'll be other guys. Trust me.

740
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,150
我也爱你  甜心
I love you too, sweetheart.

741
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,660
拜
Good-bye.

742
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,730
62年珍藏版  你的最爱
'62 limited edition. Your favorite.

743
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,150
混蛋玩意儿
Cheeky bastard.

744
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,010
谢谢你
And thank you.

745
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,150
谢什么
For what?

746
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,870
谢谢你给我这最后一杯[最后机会]
For giving me another shot.

747
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,950
还有这一切
At all this.

748
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,420
尼尔森医生死了  芬奇
We lost Dr. Nelson, Finch.

749
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,650
他是个好人
He was a good man.

750
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,220
我们来迟了  来不及救他
We arrived too late to save him.

751
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,150
似乎"来迟"得太多了
Seems to be a common occurrence of late.

752
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,710
先是舍曼斯基  后是比彻  现在又是尼尔森医生
First Szymanski, then Beecher, now Dr. Nelson.

753
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,010
机器出问题了吗  芬奇
Is something wrong with the machine, Finch?

754
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,650
我不知道
I don't know.

755
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,130
我们还错过了谁呢
Then who else are we missing?

756
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,890
早晚的事儿了  弗斯科
Just a matter of time now, Fusco.

757
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,330
你躺那里边  我拿把铲子如何
