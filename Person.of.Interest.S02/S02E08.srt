159
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,580
数字会说话
The numbers speak for themselves.

160
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,310
如果失去对产品的控制  数字什么也说明不了
The numbers mean nothing if we don't have control over our product.

161
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,100
我们本季度下滑了20%  上季度是15%
We were down 20% this quarter, 15% in the last.

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,420
恕我直言  我可不认为
With all due respect, I'm not sure

163
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,040
创意控制是我们的当务之急
creative control is what we need right now.

164
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,220
我们不是唯一一家
We're not the only publishing house

165
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,340
有困难的出版社  亨利
who's having troubles, Henry.

166
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,000
兰顿出版社可没怎么发牢骚
Random House doesn't seem to be complaining.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,100
得了  他们的规模是我们的三倍
Oh, come on, they're three times our size.

168
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,650
你想任五亿巨资与你擦身而过吗  丹尼尔
You want to walk away from $1/2 billion, Daniel?

169
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,090
明天开董事会  让他们投票  然后再决定
The board meets tomorrow. I say we let 'em vote, then we decide.

170
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,120
投票  你和塞布丽娜是大股东
A vote? You and Sabrina are majority shareholders.

171
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,150
你们俩的票才是关键  你们心里清楚
Your votes are the only ones that matter, and you know it.

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,710
你听到了吗
You're hearing this?

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,610
看来是有分歧啊  芬奇
There seems to be some discontent in the ranks, Finch.

174
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,550
有人出价要买公司
Someone made an offer on the company,

175
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,150
那迫不及待的  名叫享利
and there's a very eager taker. His name's Henry.

176
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,420
享利・布鲁克斯
Henry Brooks.

177
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,820
他是德雷克的第一个投资者
He was the Drake's first investor,

178
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,860
现在仍拥有公司5%的股份
and still owns 5% of the company.

179
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,040
这么说如果收购黄了  他损失不少
Which means he has a lot to lose if that deal doesn't go through.

180
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,900
你们经理打电话来说你要重约时间
Your manager called and said you had to reschedule.

181
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,270
说是什么电脑故障
Something about a computer malfunction.

182
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,500
那是误会
It's a misunderstanding.

183
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,000
好的  德雷克先生及其夫人要求
Good, because Mr. and Mrs. Drake have requested

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,670
为整个屋子都装上高速光纤
high-speed fiber optic throughout the house.

185
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,440
没问题
That won't be a problem.

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,120
里瑟先生  德雷克家里快搞定了
Mr. Reese, I'm almost finished at the Drakes'.

187
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,920
很温馨的家
It's quite a lovely home.

188
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,420
也别太"面不改色"了  芬奇
Don't get too comfortable, Finch.

189
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,690
塞布丽娜正要去城市的另一边开会
Sabrina's on her way to a meeting across town,

190
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,500
她丈夫在76街公园附近有个午餐会
and the husband has a lunch meeting near 76th and park.

191
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,140
我可没有分身术
I can't keep eyes on both of 'em.

192
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,160
餐厅在石街区附近
The restaurant is close to the Brownstone.

193
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,950
我盯着他  你去跟德雷克夫人
I'll keep an eye on him while you follow Mrs. Drake.

194
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,750
是的  没错  六点见
Yeah, that's right. Meet me at 6:00,

195
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,480
12街格林威治拐角处
corner of 12th and Greenwich

196
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
来电
未知号码

197
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,180
对对  我还在
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

198
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,340
卡特
Carter.

199
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,960
弗斯科都第二次把我转去语言信箱了
That's the second time Fusco sent me to voice mail.

200
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,840
我是不是该生气了
Should I be offended?

201
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,000
我是我搭档的保姆吗  约翰
Am I my partner's keeper, John?

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,280
不是  不过我肯定你对此略有见解
No, but I'll bet you still have an opinion.

203
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,320
我想给他做无罪推定
I want to give him the benefit of the doubt,

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
不过这家伙神神叨叨的
but guy's been acting jumpy.

205
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,350
鬼鬼祟祟地接电话
Sneaking off, taking phone calls,

206
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,350
像是有事儿
that sort of thing.

207
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,720
我会去查  不过首先
I'll look into it, but first,

208
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,070
你尽量查个人
you need to find out anything you can

209
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,950
他名叫韦德・哈金斯
about a man named Wade Huggins.

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,770
马里兰民兵组织的韦德・哈金斯
Maryland Militia Wade Huggins?

211
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,400
我刚接到消息他要来城里
I just got a heads up he's on his way to town

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,460
去一家出版公司进行抗议
to protest a publishing company.

213
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,210
我需要他的位置
I need his location.

214
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,340
看来你知道什么我不知道的
I take it you know something that I don't.

215
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,920
出版社的所有人夫妇有麻烦了
The husband and wife owners are in trouble.

216
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,420
我正在查是什么引起的
I'm just trying to find out who's causing it.

217
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,080
里瑟先生  丹尼尔・德雷克现在离开餐厅了
Mr. Reese, Daniel Drake is leaving the restaurant now.

218
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,960
芬奇  你还在盯着那位丈夫吗
Finch, do you still have eyes on the husband?

219
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,540
是的  怎么了
Yes. What's the matter?

220
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,100
有没有发现什么可疑情况或异常情况
Do you see anything suspicious or out of place?

221
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,410
没有  里瑟先生
No, Mr. Reese.

222
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,020
德里克夫人出事了吗
Has something happened to Mrs. Drake?

223
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,270
有人往她车里装了东西
A man just planted something on her car.

224
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,170
什么东西  是追踪装置吗
What kind of something? Like a tracking device?

225
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,850
除非追踪装置带有遥控雷管
Not unless tracking devices come with remote detonators.

226
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,090
炸弹  德里克夫人呢
A bomb. Where's Mrs. Drake?

227
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,910
我在她到前取了下来
I got to it before she arrived.

228
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,500
谢天谢地  你怎么做的
Thank God. What'd you do with it?

229
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,540
还没做
Nothing yet.

230
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,150
我们应该叫拆弹小组吧
Shouldn't we call the bomb squad?

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,540
没时间了  有来电触发装置
No time. It's got a cell phone trigger.

232
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,900
随时可能有来电
Call might come in at any second.

233
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,860
约翰  扔掉它快跑
John, you need to get away from it right now.

234
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,340
只要  找对线
Just need... to get to the wires.

235
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,890
约翰  你在吗
John, are you there?

236
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,900
我没事  芬奇
I'm okay, Finch.

237
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,660
装置是自制的
The device was homemade.

238
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,310
很粗糙  不过足以完成任务
Crude, but it would have gotten the job done.

239
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,380
现在我们有了炸弹客的手机号码
Now, we have a contact number for our bomber.

240
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,930
喂
Yeah?

241
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,860
我无意忽视你的濒死经历  里瑟先生
I don't mean to minimize your near death experience, Mr. Reese,

242
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,630
不过你确定自己黑入
but are you certain that you bluejacked

243
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,560
丹尼尔・德里克的手机了吗
Daniel Drake's phone?

244
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,170
今早  电梯里  怎么了
This morning, on the elevator. Why?

245
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,710
他还有一个手机
He must have a second one.

246
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,350
{\pos(179,135)}强制配对

247
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,350
{\pos(182,149)}完成

248
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,250
你说已经搞定了  圣地
You said it was handled, Santi.

249
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,990
放松  我在搞了
Relax, I'm on it.

250
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,530
最好是  否则
Well, you better be. Otherwise,

251
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,410
我不会给你余款的  明白吗
I'm gonna keep the rest of your fee, you got it?

252
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,910
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese,

253
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,260
我们要费心的不是马里兰民兵组织
It's not the Maryland Militia we need to worry about.

254
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,190
炸弹客刚刚联系了丹尼尔・德里克
The bomber just contacted Daniel Drake.

255
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,500
看来下令杀他妻子的人就是他
It seems he's the one that tried to kill his wife.

256
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,770
芬奇  德里克夫妇回办公室了
Finch, the Drakes are back at their office.

257
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,170
多谢你今天早上的诸多支持
Thank you for your support this morning.

258
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,740
不用担心
Oh, don't worry,

259
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,620
你已经清楚表明了你对这件事的看法  
you made it really clear how you feel about the matter.

260
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,040
需要人执手安慰就去找你的心理医生  塞布丽娜
call your shrink if you need someone to hold your hand, Sabrina.

261
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,950
我真不敢相信你居然要卖掉
I can't believe you want to sell

262
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,830
我们唯一的成果
the only thing we ever did right.

263
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,320
知道吗  我一直清楚你是个失败主义者
You know what, I always knew you were defeatist.

264
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,860
却不知道你是个没骨气的
I never knew you were spineless.

265
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,320
如果"没骨气"是指"财政审慎"  我认
If by "spineless" you mean "fiscally prudent", fine.

266
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,600
不是每个人都含着金汤匙长大
Not all of us grew up with nannies and Tiffany rattles.

267
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,340
又开始大谈"苦出身"了  你最爱来这套
Oh, the poor-kid card. That's your favorite.

268
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,950
你这个固执的  冥顽的
You are a stubborn, obtuse,

269
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,570
放纵的伪知识分子
overindulged pseudo-intellectual.

270
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,210
是吗  抱歉噢  那我们俩是谁上过耶鲁大学
Really? I'm sorry. Which one of us went to Yale?

271
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,220
-又开始了  是啊好吧  -是我
- Oh, there we go. Yeah, okay. - 'Cause that would be me.

272
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,060
你上哪里来着  西北大学
And where did you go? Northwestern.

273
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,430
-你保底的学校  -我保底的学校
- Oh, your safety school. - My safety school.

274
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,900
知道吗  你就只管随心所欲吧  亲
You know what? Keep trying to deflect all you want, hon,

275
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,350
但有脑子的女人会看到墙上高挂一行字
but a smart girl like you should see the writing on the wall:

276
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,460
"是时候卖掉公司了"
It is time to sell the company.

277
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,880
绝对不
Absolutely not.

278
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,100
你永远不会承认自己有错的  是吧
You know, you can't admit being wrong in anything, can you?

279
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,540
你永远不会放手  错了也不放
You can never admit to losing anything, no matter how misguided.

280
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,260
你听到了吗  芬奇
Are you hearing this, Finch?

281
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,940
显然我们低估了他们的婚姻分歧
Apparently we underestimated their marital discontent.

282
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,970
简直是互憎互厌
Sounds more like disgust.

283
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,240
你拆掉的那个引爆装置
The components of the incendiary device that you defused

284
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,720
正好跟民兵组织
are an exact replica of one

285
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,100
秘密手册里所记载的一款相同
detailed in the Militia's Underground Manual.

286
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,200
这么说丹尼尔・德里克雇人造了个炸弹
So Daniel Drake hired someone to build a bomb

287
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,940
这炸弹可以轻易追溯到
that could be easily traced to a group

288
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,830
那个曾公开威胁他们的组织上
that had publicly threatened their lives.

289
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,390
聪明
Very clever.

290
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,880
看来谋杀也是解除婚姻的方式之一
Guess murder is one way to break up a marriage.

291
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,600
不过离婚不是更简单吗
but wouldn't divorce have been simpler?

292
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,650
如果他想出售成功则不然了
Not if he wants the sale to go through.

293
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,310
弗兰克・迈考特想卖掉[洛杉矶]道奇队时
When Frank Mccourt was trying to sell The Dodgers,

294
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,850
被他那起
it was held up for months while he went through

295
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,360
史上最昂贵的离婚耽搁了数月
one of the most expensive divorce cases in history.

296
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,930
我不知道你还是棒球迷呢  芬奇
I didn't know you were a baseball fan, Finch.

297
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,510
-[纽约]大都会队  -不见得
- The Mets? - Not particularly.

298
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,030
-[巴尔的摩]金莺队  -也许吧
- Orioles? - I suppose.

299
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,320
-[奥克兰]运动家队  -奥克兰不错
- The A's. - Oakland is fine,

300
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,410
还有[芝加哥]小熊队  [波士顿]红袜队 
and The Cubs, and the Red Sox too.

301
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,450
不过  我不确定我对某支球队的偏爱
Although, I'm not certain my affection for any one of these teams

302
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,420
会暴露我在何处长大  里瑟先生
would reveal where I grew up, Mr. Reese.

303
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,040
好吧  现在情况如何
Okay, where were we?

304
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,060
我在他们家里发现了两人的遗嘱
I found both the Drakes' wills on their home computer.

305
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,000
如果德雷克夫人死亡
In the event of her death,

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,970
她的股票会转至其丈夫名下
Mrs. Drake's shares go to her husband.

307
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,250
24小时内他肯定会再次试图谋杀她的
So he will no doubt try to kill her again in the next 24 hours.

308
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,610
我们得找到那个杀手
We need to find that hit man.

309
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,160
德雷克说的那个名字查的怎样了  圣地
What about the name Drake used?  "Santi"?

310
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,450
我猜应该是
My best guess is that

311
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,390
一个叫内斯特・圣地亚哥的人
it belongs to a man named Nestor Santiago.

312
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,290
他多次出现在德雷克先生的通话记录
He's listed a number of times on Mr. Drake's phone records.

313
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,410
他们在弗布什的同一条街长大的
They grew up on the same street in Flatbush.

314
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,030
-儿时玩伴  -有现在的住址吗
- Childhood friends. - We have a recent address?

315
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,370
圣地亚哥八个月前刚从辛辛监狱放出来
Mr. Santiago was in Sing Sing until eight months ago.

316
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,940
之后就未出现在官方文件中了
Since then, he's stayed off the government's radar.

317
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,890
不过  逮捕他的警探之一
Although, one of the arresting detectives

318
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,510
就在第八区工作
works at the Eighth Precinct.

319
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,370
我已经请卡特警探帮忙了
I've enlisted Detective Carter's help.

320
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,780
我记得圣地亚哥  这白痴干什么了
Yeah, I remember Santiago. What'd that idiot do now?

321
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,850
他可能涉及一起谋杀
He may be involved in a homicide.

322
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,620
有什么办法让我们找到他吗
Anything you can do to shed some light on his whereabouts?

323
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,100
不太容易  他是个小毒贩
Not offhand. He was a small-time dealer,

324
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,480
后来开始吸食自己的货
started using his own product,

325
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,360
沉迷其中  不能自拔
and took a dive down the rabbit hole.

326
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,930
我在曼哈顿西部抓到他在贩毒
I pinched him selling in Hell's Kitchen.

327
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,780
没穿鞋  没穿上衣  腰里别着点四五手枪
No shoes, no shirt, and a .45 tucked into his jockeys.

328
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,020
他怎么这么快就出来了
How'd he get off with so little time?

329
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,050
律师好啊  某个上东区的金装律师
Good lawyer. Some overpriced suit from the upper east.

330
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,730
圣地亚哥干了什么
What did Santiago do?

331
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,380
我不能跟你说  比彻
I can't read you in on this one, Beecher.

332
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,440
好吧  我明白这套
Yeah, I know the drill.

333
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,370
凶案组是最高级的
Homicide task force is first class,

334
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,750
我们就是帮忙的
and the rest of us are coach.

335
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,700
不是那样的
It's not like that.

336
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,630
我就随嘴一说罢了  卡特
I'm just busting your balls, Carter.

337
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,710
让凶案组的人欠我个人情总是好的
It's always good to have one of you Task Forcers owe me a favor,

338
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,980
尤其此人还散发着玫瑰芬芳而不是满身烟味
especially one who smells like rose petals instead of an ashtray.

339
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,260
谢谢  是茉莉
Thanks, it's jasmine.

340
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,000
我的一个线人正和
Hey, listen, one of my undercovers is working with

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
与他合作过的毒贩一起干
a dealer who used to do business with him.

342
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,510
我去看看有什么线索
Let me see what I can dig up.

343
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,530
我绝对欠你一次
I will definitely owe you one.

344
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,170
芬奇  德雷克夫妇动身了
Finch, the Drakes are on the move.

345
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,370
他们前去参加公司
They're heading to a book signing

346
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,500
一名签约作家的签售会
for one of their authors.

347
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
我非常支持温室气体减排
I'm all for cutting greenhouse gases,

348
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,750
不过你应该还记得德雷克先生
but you do remember that Mr. Drake

349
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,560
想杀了他妻子吧
is trying to kill his wife?

350
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,840
她丈夫不是那种会脏自己手的人
The husband isn't the type to get his hands dirty.

351
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,500
我确信他不会在配有司机的
I'm confident he won't kill his wife

352
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,460
"林肯城市"后座上杀了他妻子
in the back of their chauffeured Town Car.

353
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,060
明白  不过我可不敢保证
Understood, but I wouldn't put it past him

354
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,550
他不会在活动上动什么手脚
to pull something at the event,

355
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,250
民兵组织的人也会在那儿
and the militia members will be in attendance.

356
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,280
正是栽赃的好时机
Perfect timing for a frame job.

357
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,610
芬奇  六点钟方向发现狙击手
Finch, I got a sniper on my 6:00.

358
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,450
我去救那妻子
I got the wife.

359
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,220
我不确定狙击手的目标是德雷克夫人  里瑟先生
I'm not sure it's Mrs. Drake the sniper's after, Mr. Reese.

360
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,700
她刚给一个匿名号码发了个短信
She just sent a text to an anonymized number.

361
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,820
内容是"现在"
It just says, "Now".

362
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,020
丈夫才是目标
The husband is the target.

363
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,430
看着点
Excuse you.

364
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,010
没事  有个疯子  他刚
No, just some maniac. He just

365
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,820
里瑟先生  怎么回事
Mr. Reese? What's happening?

366
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,870
马里兰民兵保卫美国
Maryland Militia protects America!

367
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,430
你们发表的是谎言
You're publishing lies!

368
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,850
马里兰民兵保卫美国
Maryland Militia protects America!

369
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,350
曼哈顿东村出版社不知羞耻
Shame on East Village Publishing!

370
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,160
德雷克夫人又发了一条短信
Mrs. Drake just sent another text.

371
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,190
只有一串问号和感叹号
It's several question marks and exclamation points.

372
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,920
芬奇  我明白
Finch, I think I've figured out

373
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,030
为什么机器吐出两个号码了
why the machine gave us both numbers.

374
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,920
德雷克夫妇想要干掉彼此
The drakes took out a hit on each her.

375
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,650
不好意思来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

376
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,080
离开办公室前手头又有活儿了
I had a few things to finish up before I left the office.

377
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,100
有什么要告诉我的吗  哈罗德
Something you want to share, Harold?

378
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,200
自从你论文答辩后我还没见你如此紧张过
I haven't seen you this nervous since your thesis presentation.

379
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,050
方帕不错嘛
Nice pocket square.

380
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,730
怎么  激情约会啊
What, do you have a hot date?

381
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,840
你个老东西  她是谁
You old dog. What's her story?

382
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,150
别这样  没什么  奈森
Stop. It's nothing, Nathan.

383
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,250
当然  讨论你的恋爱经历
Of course. Talking about your love life

384
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,370
有违你的隐形人风范
would run at cross purposes with your invisible man routine.

385
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,500
没事  哈罗德  我明白
That's okay, Harold, I get it.

386
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,600
不过记住
Just remember,

387
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,260
秘密对一段关系的影响深远
while mystery is a powerful tool in a relationship...

388
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,520
慢慢会积小成大
a little goes a long way.

389
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,730
相信我
Trust me.

390
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,680
昨天是你朋友的婚礼
Your friend's wedding was yesterday.

391
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,170
我猜你见到奥莉薇亚了
I take it you saw Olivia?

392
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,350
是的  见到了
Yeah, I did.

393
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,650
调停后我就没见过奥莉薇亚了
I hadn't seen Olivia since the mediation.

394
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,380
你和她说话了吗
Did you speak with her?

395
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,530
我试了
I tried.

396
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,380
你知道比恨更狠的是什么吗
You know the only thing worse than hate?

397
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,450
形同陌路
Indifference.

398
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,730
这些年我对她说了太多的谎
I told her so many lies over the years,

399
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,380
有一半我都不记得是什么了
I don't even remember what half of them were.

400
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,930
真相总会浮出水面的  哈罗德
The truth always catches up to you, Harold,

401
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,190
无论你如何隐瞒
no matter how hard you try and hide it.

402
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,650
这么说两名受害人同样也是行凶者
So we have two victims who are also perpetrators,

403
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,470
别提还有两名杀手
not to mention two hit men.

404
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,980
里瑟先生  我有考虑过
You know, Mr. Reese, it did occur to me,

405
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,440
我们可以让德雷克夫妇自生自灭
we could leave the Drakes to their own devices.

406
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,770
这有点势利啊  芬奇
That's pretty mercenary of you, Finch.

407
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,960
我喜欢
I kind of like it.

408
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,760
这样的话  我似乎跨越道德底线了
If that's the case, I may have crossed some moral threshold.

409
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,600
我不禁在想
I can't help thinking about

410
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,990
还有无辜的人需要我们的帮助  
the innocent people who could use our help

411
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,700
而我们却在浪费时间帮助一对
while we're spending all our time with a couple

412
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,440
不去做婚姻咨询却相互残杀的夫妻
that have chosen murder over marriage counseling.

413
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,280
我们有其他号码吗
Well, do we have another number?

414
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,360
很遗憾  没有
Sadly, no.

415
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,040
那今天就是德雷克夫妇的幸运日了
Then it's the Drakes' lucky day,

416
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,360
不过我们还是需要调用帮手
but we're going to need all hands on deck.

417
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,970
你能找到弗斯科吗
Were you able to locate Fusco?

418
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,050
先是把我转去了语音信箱
After sending my messages to voice mail,

419
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,250
然后弗斯科警探就把手机电池拔了
Detective Fusco removed his cell phone battery.

420
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,060
卡特说对了  他正在谋划什么
Carter was right. He's up to something.

421
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,450
他最后一次使用手机是在
Last time he used his cell phone

422
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,500
12街和格林尼治街交口
was at 12th street and Greenwich avenue.

423
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,450
我们最好查查他卷进什么事了
We better find out what he's got himself mixed up in.

424
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,410
有什么问题吗  莱奈尔
Is something wrong, Lionel?

425
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,280
没  我很好
No, I'm--I'm fine.

426
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,740
抱歉订了这么早的桌
Sorry about the early reservation.

427
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,150
要不就得订十点半的了  所以我就
The only other one they had was 10:30, so I figured--

428
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,920
没事  我喜欢只有我们俩
It's okay, I like that we got it all to ourselves.

429
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,070
很漂亮啊  你看
That is so pretty. Look at it.

430
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,730
是啊  我  这个
Yeah. I am. It's, uh...

431
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,700
很小
small.

432
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,190
拉里真好  撮合我们两个
It was nice of Larry to set us up, right?

433
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,520
他人很好
He's a sweetie.

434
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,290
是啊  我们的孩子在一起打曲棍球
Yeah, our kids play hockey together.

435
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,200
他的儿子米切尔是我的学生
His son Mitchell is one of my students.

436
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,930
很难抽时间陪儿子吧
Must be hard to spend much time with your son.

437
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,920
我是说  你身为一名警探
I mean, being a detective and all.

438
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,240
工作时间很长吧
Those are long hours, right?

439
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,100
我前妻是这么认为的
Eh, my ex thought so.

440
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,630
不过这工作倒也没什么意思
But the job's not that interesting anyway.

441
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,320
我觉得挺有意思啊
I think it's super interesting.

442
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,150
相信我  你会觉得很无聊
Believe me, you'd be bored.

443
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,970
打扰了  先生  有您的电话
Excuse me, Sir, there's a phone call for you.

444
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,650
抱歉  我要接一下
Sorry, I got to take that.

445
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,180
我这儿正有事呢
Hey, I'm kind of in the middle of something here.

446
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,380
如果服务生所言可信
If I could believe the waiter,

447
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,030
你的事快玩完了
it sounds like you're near the end of something.

448
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,060
你真的应该提高一下谈话技巧
You really do need to work on your conversational skills.

449
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,630
这次要救谁吧
So who needs saving?

450
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,760
我需要你监视叫塞布丽娜・德雷克的女人
I need you to keep an eye on a woman named Sabrina Drake.

451
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,870
我现在给你发地址  另外  拜托
I'm sending you the address, and, please,

452
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,680
把你的手机电池放回该放的地方
put your cell phone battery back where it belongs.

453
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,380
抱歉  是工作
I'm sorry, that was work.

454
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,890
我得去盯梢了
I just got called in to a stakeout.

455
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,850
好
Okay.

456
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,130
要是你不想改天再约  我可以理解
I understand if you don't want to take a rain check on the date.

457
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,730
我的工作经常如此
I mean, my job gets in the way a lot.

458
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,770
我理解  莱奈尔  我表兄是警察
I understand, Lionel. My cousin's a cop.

459
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,980
工资低  工时长
Bad pay. Bad hours.

460
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,060
要不我陪你吧
What if I join you?

461
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,840
我们不搞这种美食试吃了
We could give up on our foodie experiment

462
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,800
去我最喜欢的沙拉三明治店
and go to my favorite falafel place.

463
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,810
真的
Yeah?

464
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,650
德雷克先生有没有做什么不该做的
Mr. Drake doing anything he shouldn't?

465
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,880
正常工作  就像一切如常
Oh, he's working like everything's normal...

466
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,170
就像他没找旧友杀他妻子
and he didn't hire an ex-con to kill his wife.

467
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,390
是啊  弗斯科说他太太也在努力工作
Yeah. Fusco says the missus is hard at work too.

468
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,910
两个人到底是如何从相爱
How did two people go from being in love

469
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,720
变成相杀呢
to wanting each other dead?

470
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,310
相爱是一回事
Being in love is one thing.

471
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,450
结婚  又是另一回事了
Being married, a whole different animal.

472
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,510
婚礼誓言改变了一切
Those vows change everything.

473
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,990
哪一句  "直到死亡将我们分开"
Which one? "Till death do us part."

474
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,580
是啊  差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

475
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,060
有一天你嫁给了自己的灵魂伴侣
One day you're married to your soul mate,

476
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,510
然后眼睁睁看着他们变成了另一个人
then you watch them turn into someone else.

477
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
有时  你太爱这人曾经的样子
Sometimes you're so in love with who a person was,

478
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,040
无能再爱上他们改变后的样子
you can't bring yourself to love who they've become.

479
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,690
你想过开始新生活吗
You ever think about moving on?

480
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,330
约会吗
Like dating?

481
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,960
当然
Sure.

482
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,500
等我有空了  比如我不再是单亲妈妈
In my spare time, like when I'm not being a single mom

483
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
不再是凶案组警探  不再干这些事
or a homicide detective, or whatever this is.

484
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,590
你呢
What about you?

485
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,020
稍等
One second.

486
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,620
-卡特  -我是比彻
- Carter. - Hey, it's Beecher.

487
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,000
圣地亚哥有新消息吗
You got any news on Santiago?

488
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,520
是的  我问了我的人  他说圣地亚哥
Yeah, I talked to my guy. He said Santiago was

489
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,330
四处打听哪能偷到送餐的货车
asking around about where to boost a deli-to-door van.

490
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,500
说他要用来进入中城区某出版社大楼
Said he needed it to access some publishing building in midtown.

491
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,630
多谢  比彻
Thanks, Beecher.

492
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,740
我看圣地亚哥正要去找德雷克夫人
I think Santiago is on his way to see Mrs. Drake.

493
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,450
有人切断了电源
Someone cut the power.

494
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,920
看来德雷克夫人的杀手找到目标了
Looks like Mrs. Drake's hit man just found his target.

495
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,430
这傻帽抢劫完
So this dumbass forgets to log out

496
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,820
忘了退出他的脸书账户
of his Facebook account after he robs the place.

497
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,090
我们两小时之后抓住了他  猜他在干嘛
We pick him up two hours later. Guess what he's doing.

498
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,030
更新状态
Updating his status?

499
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,400
他难以自控啊
He couldn't help himself.

500
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,740
我真高兴你能来  朗达
I'm so glad you came, Rhonda.

501
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,590
我也是
Me too.

502
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,160
怎么了
What?

503
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,910
警探  我们有状况了
Detective, we have a problem.

504
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,210
送货员刚刚到了29层
Delivery man just arrived on the 29th floor.

505
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,500
好  我这就过去
All right, I'm on my way.

506
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,500
我很快回来  好吗
Look, I'll be right back, okay?

507
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,900
-好  -好的
- Okay. - All right.

508
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,940
纽约警察
NYPD!

509
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,720
谁在我的地盘
Who the hell is on my property?

510
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,950
-蹲下  -这些人干嘛
- Get down! - What are those guys--

511
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,980
蹲下
Get down!

512
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,100
追  追
Go! Go!

513
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,200
你们是什么人  到底怎么回事
Who are you people? What is going on?

514
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,740
谁快点告诉我
Somebody better talk to me right now

515
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,210
到底怎么回事
and tell me what the heck is going on!

516
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,280
我要
I want--

517
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,970
你干嘛
What are you doing?

518
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,960
俗话说"舍不得老婆抓不住流氓"啊
Sometimes you need to break a few eggs to save lives.

519
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,180
我确定"俗话"不是那么说的
Yeah, pretty sure that's not the saying.

520
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
兄弟
Hey, pal.

521
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,720
要我帮忙么
Can I help you?

522
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,430
不管你的事  小子
None of your business, bruja.

523
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,820
是警探小子  你有证件吗
It's detective bruja. You got some ID?

524
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,730
怎么了
What's happening?

525
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,580
纽约警察  没事的  夫人
NYPD. Everything's okay, ma'am.

526
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,560
好了  请跟我来
All right, come with me.

527
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,050
快快快快
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

528
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,650
你的支援呢  不应该有支援吗
Where's your backup? Shouldn't there be backup?

529
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,180
他们到了
Here they are now.

530
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,690
你看上去不像警官
You don't look like a police officer.

531
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,710
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

532
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,630
放我下来  放我下来
Put me down! Put me down!

533
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,680
救命  救命  来人啊
Help! Help! Somebody help!

534
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,260
-救命  -有这个必要吗
- Help! - Is that really necessary?

535
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,970
现在不制止
If we don't stop this now,

536
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,070
他们的争斗就会伤及无辜
innocent people will get caught in their marital crossfire,

537
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,690
我不允许
and I won't let that happen.

538
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,620
干得好  莱奈尔
Good job, Lionel.

539
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,080
没事  哥一直渴望协同绑架
Yeah, always wanted to be accessory to kidnapping.

540
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
多重绑架
Multiple kidnappings.

541
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,340
好在这是非工作时间  因为
It's a good thing it's after hours, because--

542
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,370
莱奈尔  你说得对
Lionel, you were right.

543
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,370
拐角的确有家冰冻酸奶店
There was a fro-yo place right around the corner.

544
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,450
这些是你同事吗
These your co-workers?

545
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,550
-我是卡特  -朗达  很高兴认识你
- Hi, I'm Carter. - Rhonda. Nice to meet you.

546
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,080
我正在跟弗斯科汇报进展
Yeah, I was just catching Fusco up on a case,

547
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,400
你既然已经了解了  我就撤了  好吧
and now you're all up to speed, I'm gonna leave, okay?

548
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,620
好  可以了
Yup, okay, you're good!

549
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,900
告诉我们你要多少  我们都给
Just tell us what you want. We will pay you.

550
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,470
不管你要什么  我们都给
We will pay you handsomely, whatever you want.

551
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,090
-你知道我们是什么人吗  -相信我
- Do you know who we are? - Trust me on this.

552
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,600
我们认识人能让你永世不得翻身
We know people who will put you away for the rest of your life.

553
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,100
闭嘴  塞布丽娜
Shut up, Sabrina.

554
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,750
你没条件跟疯子谈判
You are in no position to negotiate with this maniac.

555
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,440
至少我在维护自己的尊严
Well, at least I'm standing up for myself.

556
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,100
至于你  不如直接请他喝一杯卡布奇诺
You, on the other hand, might as well offer him a cappuccino!

557
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,490
真是太抱歉了我就想要
Well, forgive me because I want to leave here

558
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,610
四肢俱全地离开这儿  就是
with all my body parts intact. That's--oh.

559
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,290
求你拿开吧  我们很抱歉
Please take these off. We're sorry.

560
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,490
我们不想惹麻烦
We don't want any trouble.

561
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,390
-有点晚了  -无论  无论你要什么
- Little late for that. - Whatev--whatever you want,

562
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,030
只要开口  我们都可以给你
just tell us, we will make it happen.

563
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,690
你是谁
Who are you?

564
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,890
我是阻止你们两个小丑自相残杀的人
I'm the guy who stopped you two jokers from killing each other.

565
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,180
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

566
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,610
内斯特・圣地亚哥在哪儿
Where's Nestor Santiago?

567
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,040
内斯特
Nestor?

568
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,010
你雇了内斯特来杀我  那个吸毒成性的疯子
You hired Nestor to kill me? The drug-addicted lunatic?

569
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,220
至于你  找了质高价优的专业人士
You, on the other hand, went upscale, professional.

570
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,140
你有联系电话或者地址吗
Do you have a contact number or an address?

571
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,880
你太自私了
You are so selfish.

572
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,350
我自私
I'm the one who's selfish.

573
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,180
那上一次你热心助人是几时来着
When's the last time you did anything for someone other than yourself?

574
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,580
居然还有脸说这话
Oh, says the good Samaritan.

575
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,740
你知道吗  你不在办公室
Do you know, when you're not in the office,

576
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,030
就满嘴的厨房挡板啊  颜色调板啊
all you talk about are backsplashes and color palettes?

577
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,290
我问你的意见  是因为我想知道你的意见
I ask your opinion because I want your opinion.

578
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,740
至于你  却一直在无视我
You, on the other hand, ignore me.

579
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,610
我不在乎
I don't care!

580
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,830
一个人能把厨房装修几次
How many times can a person redo their kitchen?

581
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,580
我喜欢你折腾三遍之前的那个厨房
I liked the one we had three kitchens ago.

582
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,180
那是你甘于平庸
If you're okay with mediocrity.

583
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,960
这是干嘛
What is this?

584
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,250
婚姻咨询
Marriage counseling.

585
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
为什么不直接把他们吊在天花板上
Why not just dangle them off the roof

586
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,690
逼他们说出如何找到杀手
and force them to tell us how to find the hit men?

587
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,500
约翰大概会喜欢这一选择
While John would probably enjoy that option,

588
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,360
那只能治标不治本
it would be a temporary solution.

589
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,370
我们得确保德雷克夫妇
We need to make sure the Drakes

590
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,410
不会再企图谋杀对方
won't try to kill each other again.

591
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,360
也该试试别的方法了
Maybe it's time to try a different tack.

592
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,730
我到了
This is me.

593
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,420
今天挺有趣的哈
That was fun, huh?

594
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,140
我的第一次盯梢
My first stakeout.

595
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,350
也许下次我还能看见行动呢
Maybe next time I'll even see some action.

596
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,660
下次
Next time?

597
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,280
好
Okay.

598
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,210
谁在那儿
Who's there?

599
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,780
-求你了  我们想回家  -怎么了
- Please, we'd like to go home. - What's going on?

600
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,620
如果你回家  圣地亚哥先生就会找到你
If you go home, Mr. Santiago will find you,

601
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,550
而你雇的杀手  德雷克夫人
and your hit man, Mrs. Drake,

602
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,050
对你丈夫也做同样打算
will likely have the same plan for finding your husband.

603
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,520
你是谁  你为什么要这么做
Who are you, and why are you doing this?

604
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,290
我们助人为乐
We help people,

605
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,880
即使他们不值得我们助
even when they don't necessarily deserve it.

606
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,940
你一定觉得我们是恶棍
You must think we're monsters.

607
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:48,150
不  我曾看到过真正的恶棍  德雷克夫人
No. I have looked into the faces of real monsters, Mrs. Drake.

608
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,310
我现在看到的是两个人
What I see here are two people

609
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,360
因为彼此不再交流
who stopped talking to one another,

610
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,930
相互怨恨  反目成仇
whose frustration turned to hatred.

611
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,550
然而  不像别的夫妻
Although, unlike other couples,

612
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,580
你们选择了谋杀对方  而不是离婚
you've opted for murder instead of divorce.

613
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,720
我想我该赞赏你们如此目标明确
I suppose I should commend you for being so goal-oriented.

614
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,710
不不  你们看上去不像恶棍
No, no, you don't look like monsters.

615
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,730
事实上  你们看上去曾非常相爱
In fact, you used to look like you were very much in love.

616
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,850
-您是格蕾斯吗  -什么
- Are you Grace? - Excuse me?

617
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,220
我是  谢谢你
Yes. Hi. Thank you.

618
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,160
欢迎参加  你的生日寻宝
第一站  90和第5大街路口

619
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,870
{\pos(196,63)}欢迎参加  你的生日寻宝
第一站  90和第5大街路口

620
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,420
巧克力酥皮是我的最爱
Chocolate-covered's my favorite.

621
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,000
他给你留了东西
He left you something else.

622
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,230
能帮我拿一下吗  谢谢
Can you hold that? Thank you.

623
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,860

克莱曼婷花店
麦迪逊大街72号

624
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,010
{\an1}晚上11点
放心去找弗兰克

625
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,340
那是在我叔叔的海滨别墅
That's my uncle's beach house.

626
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,550
是啊  还有你婶婶恐怖的纯素沙拉
Yeah, and your aunt's awful vegan smoothies.

627
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,290
吃起来像发霉的花生
They tasted like rotten peanuts.

628
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,790
你拼命想离开
You were desperate to leave,

629
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,510
说你要去游泳
and said you wanted to go swimming.

630
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,010
那是我们几周来的第一天假
It was our first day off in weeks.

631
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,590
是的  但是我们忘带泳衣了
Right, but we forgot our bathing suits.

632
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,930
我想全裸释放
I wanted to go au naturale,

633
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,250
但是你担心那些孩子
but you were worried about those kids.

634
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,580
我可不想你因为
I didn't want you to be arrested for

635
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,790
在海难的未成年人面前裸奔而被捕
running around bare-ass naked in front of a bunch of minors.

636
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,930
你那时还怀着孕
You were still pregnant then.

637
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,410
我不太了解我雇佣的人
I don't know much about the man I hired,

638
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,820
但是我知道的全告诉你
but I'll tell you what I can.

639
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,950
我通过一家私人保安公司联系了一个人
I contacted somebody through a private security firm.

640
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,680
我汇了一半的钱给了一个瑞士银行的账户
I wired half the money to a Swiss Bank account

641
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,440
然后得到了一个电话号码
and got a phone number in return,

642
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,020
剩下的钱完事后再付
and the rest was due after.

643
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,170
我想过叫停  但是那个号码
I tried to call it off, but the number

644
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,030
签售会以后就停用了
stopped working after the book signing.

645
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,470
那圣地亚哥呢
And Santiago?

646
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,240
我昨天联系过他  告诉他我改主意了
I tried to call him yesterday, tell him I changed my mind,

647
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,380
但是
but...

648
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,290
他一直恨你  亲爱的
he always hated you, honey.

649
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,210
他说就当是帮我忙了
Yeah, he said I should consider it a favor.

650
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,490
我们要去哪儿
Where are we going?

651
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,040
你说你想回家  那就回吧
You said you want to go home. That's where we're going.

652
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,820
你  你说过他们会在那儿等我们
You--you said they'd be expecting us there.

653
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,810
叫不回杀手  只好引杀手来找我们
If we can't call off the dogs, we'll bring them to us.

654
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,680
来吧
Come on.

655
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,550
你好
Hello.

656
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,820
你也好
Hello back.

657
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,190
谢谢你安排的寻宝
Thank you so much for the scavenger hunt.

658
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,520
我太喜欢了
I loved it.

659
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,530
上来吧
Come on up.

660
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,910
你怎么能安排这些
How did you get us in here?

661
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,600
我是讲解员
I work as a docent.

662
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,710
时不时能有点额外的好处
It affords me a few perks now and then.

663
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,030
今天真谢谢你
Thank you so much for today.

664
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,900
真是  真是太完美了
It was... it was perfect.

665
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,510
还没结束呢
It's not over yet.

666
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,220
上周到的
It arrived last week...

667
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,940
一位匿名人士捐赠的
from an anonymous donor.

668
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,360
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

669
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,980
你介意我们离开这倒霉窗户吗
Do you mind if we get the hell away from this window?

670
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,950
这是在等枪子儿
We're sitting ducks.

671
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,560
就是这个目的  德雷克先生
That's the point, Mr. Drake.

672
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,290
得让你们的杀手知道你们在家
Those hit men of yours need to know someone's home.

673
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,190
厨房很安全
Kitchen is secure.

674
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,400
莱奈尔  下次你约会的时候
You know, Lionel, next time you have a date,

675
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,890
别这么神神秘秘的
don't be so melodramatic.

676
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,020
我还以为你在谋划什么
I thought you might be up to something.

677
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,230
是啊  谋划个人私生活
Yeah, it's called a personal life.

678
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,600
屁股吃了一颗子弹
After taking a bullet in the ass

679
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,830
救了你也不止一次了
and saving yours more than once,

680
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,710
您认为我能有点隐私了吗
you think I've earned just a little privacy?

681
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
不能
No.

682
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,240
你确定他们会出现
You're sure they're even gonna show up?

683
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,040
这活儿得在明天之前搞定  对吗
You needed the job done by tomorrow, right?

684
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,540
是的
Yeah.

685
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,930
在董事会投票之前
Before the board votes?

686
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,030
是的
Yeah.

687
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
你们俩都没有支付全额
And neither of you paid the full amount?

688
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,710
没有
No.

689
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,310
很确定
Pretty sure.

690
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,090
我们要不要也带上枪
Should we get guns too?

691
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,080
我有更好的办法
I have a better idea.

692
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,910
等等
Wait.

693
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,540
-待着  -你要去哪儿
- Stay here. - Where are you going?

694
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,300
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

695
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,040
拜托
Come on!

696
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,790
至少我们不会挨饿
Well, at least we won't get hungry.

697
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,310
神奇小子呢
Hey, where's Wonder Boy?

698
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,520
他在检查楼上
He's securing the upper levels,

699
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,690
以防圣地亚哥带同伴来
just in case Santiago brings company.

700
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,900
这么有钱  他们还是不快乐
All this money, and they're still unhappy.

701
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,560
丹尼尔  我们是怎么了
Oh, Daniel, what happened to us?

702
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,280
说实话  我不知道
Honestly, I don't know.

703
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,580
那家伙说得对  我们不再交流了  不是吗
That guy was right about us not talking, wasn't he?

704
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,760
那事发生之后  你什么都不想谈了
You didn't want to discuss anything real after it happened.

705
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,020
我想再试一次  我问过你
I wanted us to try again. I asked you.

706
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,370
我也想再试试  但当时太急了
I wanted to try again too. It was just too soon.

707
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,970
然后你就说我应该休息一下
And then you said maybe I should take some time off,

708
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,240
好像都是我的错  因为我工作太卖命了
like it was my fault because I was working too hard.

709
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,690
我想让你待在家里
I wanted you to stay at home

710
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,640
是因为你刚经历了创伤  塞布丽娜
because you'd just been through a trauma, Sabrina,

711
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
不是责备你什么
not because I blamed you for anything.

712
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,130
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

713
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,020
我的天啊  你原来是这么想的
Oh, my God. Is that what you thought?

714
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,940
难怪我总是无法亲近你
No wonder I couldn't reach you.

715
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,890
我还一直步步紧逼
And I kept pushing and pushing, and--

716
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,630
我  我不知道
I-I didn't know.

717
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,210
我从没明确说出来过  是吗
I never actually said it out loud, did I?

718
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,550
我埋头工作
I just threw myself into work

719
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,700
是因为这比面对那事要轻松
because that was easier than facing what had happened.

720
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,470
然后不知不觉  我拥有的就只剩公司了
And next thing I knew, the company was all I had left,

721
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,210
而你却想从我手中抢走
and you wanted to take it from me.

722
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,770
我得做个了结  我们之间
I had to be done... with us.

723
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,900
我一直都很愤怒
I mean, I am so angry all the time, and--

724
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,020
我了解那种感觉
I know the feeling.

725
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,660
我不想一无所有地离开
I mean, I didn't want to walk away with nothing.

726
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,350
毕竟我们经历了这么多
Not after everything we'd been through,

727
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,580
我成长的环境又是那样
not after the way I grew up.

728
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,470
我必须要卖掉它  即使
I needed to sell, even if--

729
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,560
英雄所见略同哈
Great minds think alike, huh?

730
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,750
丹尼  如果我们能摆脱
Danny, if we get out of this...

731
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,930
当  当我们摆脱
When. When we get out of here.

732
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,000
也许我们可以
Maybe we could--

733
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,830
从头再来会不会很疯狂
Too crazy if we try again?

734
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,670
我觉得我们已经够疯狂了
I think it's just crazy enough.

735
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,700
很抱歉我想杀死你  亲爱的
I'm so sorry I tried to kill you, honey.

736
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,460
我也是
Me too.

737
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,080
纽约警察
NYPD!

738
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,280
弗斯科
Fusco!

739
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,330
-不  -求你住手
- No! - Please, don't do this!

740
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,180
你躲不过去的  警探
You can't hide from me, Detective.

741
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,980
她才没躲
Hey, she ain't hiding.

742
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,900
你还好吧
Are you okay?

743
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,290
还好  
Yeah.

744
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,700
和快乐先生共事  我哪敢不穿防弹衣

Grace, there's something you should know about me

790

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,820
哈罗德  不论你说什么
Harold, there's nothing you can say

792
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,520

that will make me run away,

793

但你应该换个时间再说
But you should tell me in your own time,

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,180
我们都可以一起发掘
we can discover together.

799
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,880
{\an9}{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}? You will look for me ?

800
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,670
{\an9}{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}? And I'll be gone ?

801
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,590
{\an9}{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}? And I'll be gone ?

802
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,460
{\an9}{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}? You will look for me ?
