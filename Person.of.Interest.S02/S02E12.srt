把枪放下  举起手来
Drop the gun! Hands above your head!

159
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,870
你说要几个小时  现在都几天了
You said hours. It's been days.

160
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,780
如果你还继续违反规定  我可以轻易
If you're gonna keep bending the rules, I can easily--

161
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,280
我没有违反什么  典狱长  但在此期间
I'm not "bending" anything, warden, but in my time here

162
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,740
我发现了15起以上严重违反
I've noticed no less than 15 serious infractions

163
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,670
纽约市监管囚犯条例的行为
of New York regulations governing the care and treatment of prisoners.

164
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,800
所以你不如先处理好了  再来威胁我
So perhaps you should tend to those before threatening me.

165
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,620
我想把手铐解开
Look, I want to un-cuff these guys.

166
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,690
卡特  他们中有一人 
Carter, one of these men

167
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,210
是位训练有素的秘密刺客
is a highly trained covert assassin.

168
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,370
我得让他信任我
I need him to trust me.

169
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,340
我们听到了四个故事
So, we got 4 stories

170
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,480
四个身份都通过了背景检查
and 4 IDs that pass background checks.

171
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,960
要么有个人在撒谎
So either someone's lying

172
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,630
要么四个人都抓错了
or we got the wrong four guys.

173
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,550
如果我没猜错  我们要找的那人
If I'm right, the man we're looking for is backed

174
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,740
背后有强大的私人情报网支持着
by a powerful private intelligence network

175
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,730
掌握的资源足以媲美政府机构
with resources comparable to any government,

176
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,870
他们能够为自己的特工
and they could certainly create an airtight cover

177
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,940
提供天衣无缝的掩护身份
for one of their operatives.

178
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,750
我可不会让那西装男
I'm not gonna let the man in the suit slip away

179
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,630
凭个驾照就过关
just because his license checks out.

180
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,320
现在  克拉克  瓦茨和霍尔特都住在外州
Now, Clark, Watts, and Holt all live out of state,

181
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,970
我让局里去查他们的家和单位了
and I've got agents checking their homes and businesses.

182
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,600
不过沃伦先生就在华尔街工作
But Mr. Warren apparently works right down on Wall Street.

183
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,650
我看我们去查下那个地址是不是
What say we make sure that address isn't just

184
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,830
空办公室
an empty office?

185
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,790
-走吧  -好
- Come on. - Okay.

186
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,470
发件箱  未知号码

187
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,470
{\pos(183,159)}有麻烦了  我们正在前往
约翰・沃伦的工作地点

188
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,720
就去查吧，警探

189
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,920
他在这里工作多久了
How long has he been working here?

190
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,330
至少两年了
At least two years.

191
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,380
我从去年九月开始为他工作
I've been at his desk since last September.

192
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,060
到底是怎么回事
What's this all about?

193
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,490
你最后一次见他是什么时候
When was the last time you saw him?

194
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,660
沃伦先生几天没打电话也没露面了
Mr. Warren hasn't called or come in for days.

195
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,460
我担心死了  你知道他在哪儿吗
I've been worried sick. Do you know where he is?

196
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,030
核实她和这栋楼所有人的身份
Check ID on her and everyone in the building.

197
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,890
硬盘  照片等统统拷贝
Clone the hard drive, photograph everything,

198
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,900
收集所有指纹
and dust it all for prints.

199
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,410
是  长官
Yes, Sir.

200
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,570
办公室不错  是吧
It's a nice office, isn't it?

201
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,450
你做掩护身份  还真是滴水不漏
When you cook up a cover, you don't mess around.

202
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,560
约翰・沃伦是安全掩护身份
John Warren is our friend's clean cover.

203
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,860
我们工作时从没用过
We never use it for work.

204
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,940
这是约翰最完整的身份
It's the most complete identity that John has,

205
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,980
也是最贴近他真实过去的
and it most closely matches the details of his true past.

206
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,820
但约翰・沃伦仍然是虚构的
But John Warren is still an illusion,

207
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,760
履历不完整的非真实存在
the incomplete footprint of a man who doesn't exist.

208
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,210
如果我们出了错
If we make a mistake,

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,060
或者唐纳利找出了漏洞
or if Donnelly spots a single flaw,

210
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,020
我们和我们的工作将陷入极度危机
we and the work that we do will be in very grave jeopardy.

211
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,270
有危险的不仅仅是约翰  警探
John's not the only one in danger, Detective.

212
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,080
你也一样
You are too.

213
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
你真会鼓舞士气  芬奇
This is a hell of a pep talk, Finch.

214
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,910
其他三位嫌犯还以为他们被关押
Look, the other three suspects still think they're being held

215
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,110
是要逼他们招供谋杀
for the murders they were going to commit,

216
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,320
一旦他们发现唐纳利
but as soon as they figure out Donnelly's

217
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
其实是在找约翰
actually looking for John,

218
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,010
他们会毫不犹豫地供出他
they'll give him up in a heartbeat.

219
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,350
把这罪名安到他们身上吧
I say let's pin this on one of them.

220
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,220
很高兴我们所想一致
I'm so glad we're on the same page.

221
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,670
我正在查那几名雇佣兵的身份
I've been working to identify our three mercenaries.

222
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,000
如果我们让唐纳利发现
If we can hand Donnelly

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,680
里面哪怕有一人有军事背景
a name and a military background for even one of them,

224
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
也许约翰就能获释了
it might get John released.

225
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,620
如果不成功  我在筹备越狱计划
And if that doesn't work, I'm engineering an escape plan.

226
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,260
是噢  那你最好赶快
Yeah, well, you better work fast.

227
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,700
也许弗斯科能帮上忙
Maybe Fusco can give you a hand.

228
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,460
{\pos(202,159)}麦克风打开

229
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,870
等等  不
Wait a second! No!

230
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,060
我是警察  这是干什么
I'm a cop! What are you doing?

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,290
为什么跟踪我
Why are you following me?

232
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,550
你和那些亚美尼亚坏蛋是一伙的  是吧
You are with the bad Armenians, aren't you?

233
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,060
这是干什么  我是警察
What are you doing? I'm a cop!

234
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,070
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help.

235
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,260
-天啊  我的眼睛  -弗斯科在忙  卡特
- Oh, God, my eye! - Fusco's busy, Carter.

236
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,100
{\pos(261,137)}麦克风关闭

237
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,960
还是我来吧
I think I'd better handle this.

238
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,700
卡特
Carter.

239
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,680
-你怎么看  -我觉得太真了
- So what do you think? - Looks pretty damn real to me.

240
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,080
不过这可能正好告诉我们
But maybe that just tells us

241
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,790
他隐姓埋名了多久
how long our man's been undercover.

242
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,230
从现在起  戴着这个
Look, from now on, I want you to wear this.

243
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,160
这个无线耳机和我的手提电脑相连
It's a wireless earpiece linked to my laptop.

244
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,740
这样我就能在审讯中为你补充问题和资讯
It's so I can feed you questions and info during your interrogations.

245
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,060
更方便我们配合
It'll help us be a better team.

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,990
我们联手合作  把他们的生活
Together, we're gonna sift through their lives

247
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,160
查个底朝天

Got them straight off the servers at Wright-Patterson.

257
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,280
你们只需要找间工厂
All you need is a factory and you'll be launching

258
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,400
六个月后自己的无人战斗机就下线了

-我的天  -抱歉

一定是前台给错钥匙了
The front desk must have given us the wrong key.

261
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,110
知道叛国罪要受何刑罚吗
Do you know the penalty for treason?

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,810
看看他们的表情
The look on their faces.

I should have brought my camera.

Can we just do this and go?

这是我第一次连杀三人
It's my first triple homicide.

268
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,630
不知道我还应该准备好笑话
Didn't know I was supposed to prepare jokes.

269
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,580
他们不是受害人  他们是敌方战斗人员
These aren't murder victims. These are enemy combatants.

270
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,410
不过也没错  我们是杀手  约翰
But yes, we are killers, John.

这是我们的工作
That is our job.

如果你想把工作做好

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,900
就得学会热爱工作
you're gonna have to learn to love your work.

274

Have you ever killed anyone?

Have you?

-回答问题才行  -很好  卡特

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,350
那么  你
Now, have you...

Yes.

在部队  95年
In the army in '95.

283
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,100
当时我在波斯尼亚执行维和任务
I was in Bosnia for the IFOR peacekeeping mission.

284
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,980
我们在克拉丹周边巡逻
We were on patrol near Kladanj.

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,870
半夜  我悄悄离开大路
Middle of the night, I sneak off the road

286
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,300
想去林子里小便
to take a whiz in the woods.

287
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,670
碰到了一个塞族武装分子带着一袋地雷
And there's this Serb militant with a bag of land mines,

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,710
拿枪对着我
AK pointed right at me.

289
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,310
枪瞎火了
It misfired.

290
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,430
所以我才活到了今天
That's the only reason why I'm still here.

291
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,390
我在他再次扣扳机前扑倒了他
I jumped him before he could pull again.

292
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,550
我们在地上扭打起来
We thrashed around in the dirt.

293
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,660
我扭断了他的脖子
And I broke his neck.

294
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,930
不想提这事了
Really don't like talking about this.

295
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,130
继续施压  你触到他的痛处了
Keep pushing. You hit a nerve.

296
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,970
你在军队里服役多久
How long did you serve in the military?

297
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,210
95年到01年

我想你能否动用纽约警局的资源

434
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,060
确定他的身份
to identify him.

435
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,080
他  小菜一碟
Him? That's easy.

436
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,730
他就是那个到处打探考文枪杀案的政府探子
That's the government spook who was sniffing around when Corwin got shot.

437
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,430
好  多谢  警探
Okay. Thank you, Detective.

438

你能不能帮我们摆脱这群
Any chance you can give us a hand

439
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,480
追杀我们的亚美尼亚

440
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,200
你有仇人吗
Do you have any enemies?

我确定
Well, I'm pretty sure

442

镜子后面那哥们不怎么喜欢我

443
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
逼问细节

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,320
在911之后又重回军队  而你没有
wound up re-enlisting right after 9/11, but not you.

449
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,020

There's a point where if you stay a soldier any longer,

450

To this day, I don't know if he was a terrorist or...

599
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,250
一个在错误时间醒来的普通人
just a guy who woke up at the wrong time.

600
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,150
好了  可以问了
Okay, ready when you are.

601
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,520
你恋爱过吗
Ever been in love?

602
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,110
一次
Once.

603
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,990
艾莉森・韦斯特
Allison West.

604
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,300
{\pos(167,160)}名字  艾莉森

对了  这就是答案
There's your answer, by the way.

607
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,600
什么答案
To what?

608
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
{\pos(221,80)}出生证明

609
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,480
我为什么离开军队
Why I left the military.

610
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,930
双子塔被袭时  我和艾莉
When the planes hit the towers, I was with Alli

611
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,160
在尼加拉瀑布的酒店里
in a hotel room in Niagara falls.

612
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,830
我那时刚刚退役
I had just gotten out of the service.

613
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,760
但当我们一起坐在床上
But as we sat together on that bed,

614
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
看着一切发生
watching it all go down,

615
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,290
我知道我必须回去
I knew I had to go back.

616
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,610
我看着她
And I looked at her.

617
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,670
她一言不发  努力坚强
She was quiet, trying to be strong.

618
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,300
我不知道
I don't know, I--

619
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,170
也许我是害怕了
maybe I was scared.

620
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,120
当我看着她  我看到了另一种完全不同的人生
But when I looked at her, I saw this whole other life.

621
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,920
如果我回到军队就永远不会拥有的人生
A life I knew I'd never have if I went back.

622
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,520
所以我留下了
So I stayed.

623
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,180
后来呢
What happened?

624
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,040
我是个傻瓜
I was an idiot.

625
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,020
让她离开了
Let her slip away.

626
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,680
我立刻就后悔了  但为时已晚
I instantly regretted it, but it was too late.

627
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,950
真有意思  一个决定  改变整个人生
It's funny how the choices you make change who you become.

628
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,560
选这条路  还是那条路
Pick one path or the other.

629
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,820
在银行听到爆炸声  试图帮忙
Hear an explosion at a bank and try to help,

630
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,950
突然就
and suddenly--

631
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,990
这么多年后  我仍然在想
All these years later I still wonder...

632
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,000
如果双子塔倒塌之后我重新入伍
if I had re-upped when the towers came down...

633
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,030
现在我会是怎样
who would I be now?

634
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,430
我们已经审讯几个小时了
We've been in here for hours.

635
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,300
有任何证据证明沃伦的身份
Do we have anything that proves Warren's

636
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,780
是假的吗
not who he says he is?

637
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,750
还有最后一个测试可以做
There's one last test we can try.

638
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,970
这到底是什么测试
Just what kind of test is this exactly?

639
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,720
我的眼线看到雅利安派的
One of my people spotted the Aryans

640
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,180
之前找过沃伦的麻烦
hassling Warren earlier,

641
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,580
如果我们任其发展
so if we let nature run its course,

642
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,950
也许西装男能给我们展示一下格斗技巧
maybe the man in the suit will show us his combat skills.

643
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,230
你疯了么  你会引发骚乱
Are you crazy? You'll start a riot.

644
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,210
把所有警卫清离院子
I'd like all the guards out of the yard.

645
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,260
马上  有劳
Now, please.

646
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,370
怕了么  菜鸟
Are you scared, fish?

647
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,680
来吧  接招
Come on! Get some!

648
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,570
快点  还击啊
Come on, fight back.

649
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,870
够了
He's had enough.

650
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,870
好了  起来  我们走
Okay, get up. Let's go.

651
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,760
你到底怎么回事
What the hell happened to you?

652
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,650
你曾是个好警察
You used to be good police.

653
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,700
但这事一开始
Ever since this thing started,

654
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,040
你就一直在违反规定
you've been bending the rules...

655
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,170
我认为我们的国家正受到攻击
I believe that this country is under attack...

656
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,390
这是不对的  唐纳利
and this is not right, Donnelly.

657
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,260
-隐形敌人的袭击  -你做得太过了
- by an invisible enemy. - You are over the line!

658
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,000
我会做一切我必须做的
I will do whatever I have to do--

659
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
你必须做的就是看好了
All you have to do is watch.

660
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,160
把文森特・霍尔特带进来
Get Vincent Holt back in that box!

661
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,460
你的名字不是霍尔特
Your name ain't Holt.

662
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,570
你也不是律师  你是雇佣兵
And you're no lawyer. You're a mercenary.

663
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,650
前特种部队  很可能是三角洲部队
Ex-special forces. Probably delta.

664
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,350
至少你的伙伴
At least that's what your buddies

665
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,780
凯利和麦卡沃伊是这么说的
Kelly and MaCavoy told us.

666
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,300
看  他们很聪明  做了交易
Now see, they were smart. They got a deal.

667
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,530
既然你不愿说出你的名字
But since you won't give me your name,

668
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,120
我只有咬定你了
I can just gitmo your ass.

669
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,070
派克  韦恩・F  我要见律师
Packer, Wayne F. Now get me a lawyer.

670
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,290
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

671
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,270
能证明那是你的真名吗
Can you offer any proof that's your real name?

672
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,680
我说了我要见律师
I said get me a lawyer.

673
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,370
只要我认为你会威胁国家安全  就别想
Not while I still think you're a threat to national security.

674
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,880
说吧  大兵  你的任务是什么
Come on, soldier, what's your mission here?

675
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,090
凯利已经说了是你们在银行设置的炸药
Kelly already told me you set the explosives in the bank.

676
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,480
不是我们
It wasn't us.

677
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,260
你刚刚承认了你们是一伙的
But you just admitted you were with him.

678
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,300
我可以定你个共谋罪
So now I got you on conspiracy.

679
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,520
你唯一能做的就是供你的老大
Your only play is to roll up on your boss.

680
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,060
-你替谁卖命  -我不会出卖别人
- So who are you working for? - I'm not your rat.

681
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,180
这回答表明确实有"老大"的存在
A response that suggests that there is in fact a boss to rat out.

682
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,680
去你的  贱人
Screw you, bitch.

683
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,110
那又可以加上杀手罪和黑社会团伙之类的罪
That adds contract killing and a whole bunch of RICO stuff.

684
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,610
你是要交待出你老大的名字
Now you want to give me the name of your boss

685
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,920
还是要我直接起诉你为"西装男"
or can I just charge you as the man in a suit?

686
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,880
这就是你要找的人  唐纳利
That's your man, Donnelly.

687
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,910
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

688
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,500
你所说的一切都将做为承堂证供
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

689
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,720
你有权请律师
You have the right to an attorney.

690
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,410
出人  打开一号门
Coming out. Open on one.

691
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,500
我准备好了  警探
I'm ready, Detective.

692
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,320
我已经把约翰的详细越狱计划发给你了
I've emailed you the details of my plan for John's escape.

693
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,770

All you have to do--

694
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,340
没必要了  芬奇
Won't be necessary, Finch.

695
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,310
形势在控制之中
Situation's under control.

696
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,740
对了  你欠我一部手机
And by the way, you owe me a phone.

{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? The girls smile ?

703
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,710
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? And people forget ?

704
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,880
在找人吗
Looking for someone?

705
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,250
没有
No one in particular.

706
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,420
弗斯科不来庆祝我获释吗
Fusco didn't want to celebrate my release?

707
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,090
芬奇安排了点事给他
Finch has him tied up with something.

708
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,670
我们两只有一人能逃走
Only one of us are gonna get out of this.

709
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,530
我一开枪  你就玩命跑
When I start shooting, you run like hell

710
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,300

No, Lionel. Save yourself.

712
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,630

You ready? Get ready to go.

713
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,020
我只想说谢谢你
I just want to say thank you.

714
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,200
我能撑过去多亏
I couldn't have got through this without...

715
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,000
有朋友陪我聊
a friend to talk to.

716
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,200
那些话里  有真的吗
So was any of it true?

717
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,590
我深表怀疑
I sincerely doubt that.

718
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,070
祝贺你  卡特
Congratulations, Carter.

719
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,530
你刚刚抓住了西装男

720
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,880

结束了  约翰

我告诉过你我们能抓住他

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,670
但恐怕这是你最后一次执行抓捕了
But I'm afraid that's the last collar you'll ever make.

726
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,670
我那么信任你  卡特  你却丢弃了我的信任
I trusted you, Carter, and you threw it away

727
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,130
丢弃了前途无量的职业
along with a very promising career.

728
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,490
抱歉
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,790
是我的错
It was my fault.

730
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,290
实际上  约翰  并非如此
Actually, John, it's not.

731
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,910
你们俩玩的那个小把戏
This little game you two have been playing,

732
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,860
暴露的不是你  是她

733
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,720
现在我需要弄清楚  你到底是谁
And now I'm going to find out exactly who you are.
