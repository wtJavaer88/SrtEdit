你知道我们在这儿造什么
You knew what we were building here.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,060
它要查的是阴谋  是阴谋策划者
This thing looks for plotters, schemers.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,180
我们造它是为了在恐怖分子行动前及时制止
We built it to stop terrorists before they could act.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,040
要是国会知道了你在造的这台机器
If congress knew about this machine you're building.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,590
你会去坐牢
You would go to jail.

00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,440
估计不会让咱俩当狱友吧
I don't suppose they'd let us be cell-mates.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,980
搜集信息  对我不成问题
Knowledge is not my problem.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,710
利用这些信息做点什么
Doing something with that knowledge,

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,950
是带你来此的原因
that's where you'd come in.

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,600
迟早有一天  我们俩会死掉
Sooner or later, both of us will probably wind up dead.

如果发生意外  我有应急预案

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,950
她想把你从暗处引出来
She was trying to lure you out into the open.

23
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,940
她要找的不是我  她要找的是他

他们对你来说  不过是蝼蚁

只有一次  我被一个人挡了下来
Except for this one time when someone stopped me,

89
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,860
那个人居然能预知我的行动
someone who just knew what I was about to do.

造个东西来保护焦虑无助的小羔羊们
to build something to protect its panicked, little flock.

95
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,420
我还以为他们永远都不会成功
I also thought they'd never pull it off,

96
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,200
因为我不知道你的存在
because I didn't know about you.

97
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,150
你成功了  是吧
And you pulled it off, didn't you?

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,390
那个监控我们所有人的东西
Something to watch over all of us.

99

只有一个问题  哈罗德
The only question, Harold,

100
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,170
为什么它没保护你呢
is why it didn't protect you.

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,720
芬奇不想露面是有原因的
Finch went off the grid for a reason.

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,180
我在找我的朋友
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

159
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,240
有情报说  你应该能帮上忙
I have a source that says you might be able to help.

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,240
我从没见过这俩人
I've never seen either of them.

161
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,500
再看看
Take another look.

162
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,650
我的情报从不出错
My source is never wrong.

163
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,820
我这辈子从没见过这俩人
I've never seen either of them before in my life,

164
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,060
听懂了吗
you understand?

165
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,280
你没说谎
You're not lying.

166
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,740
那我到底来这里干吗
Then why the hell am I here?

167
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,950
我不知道  伙计  真的
I have no idea, dude. Truly.

168
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,390
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

169
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,210
我猜猜  你惹上了麻烦
Let me guess, you're in some kind of trouble,

170
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,670
有生命危险
the life-threatening kind.

171
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,460
真是难以置信
I can't believe it.

172
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,970
我就是应急预案  后备人选
I'm the contingency, the backup.

173
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,960
什么
The what?

174
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,850
一旦发生意外  他根本不想让我找他
He didn't want me to find him if anything went wrong.

175
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,310
他只想要我继续救人
He just wanted me to keep rescuing people.

176
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,580
像你一样的人
People like you.

177
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,450
到底怎么回事
So what is it?

178
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,120
你惹到了这些家伙
You pissed these guys off somehow,

179
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,710
他们正准备干掉你
and they were about ready to kill you

180
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,410
我就刚好进门了
when I just happened to walk in the door?

181
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,110
不不不  我们只是 
No, no, no. we're just--

182
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,050
只是在谈话而已
we're just talking.

183
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,920
不  不  不
No, no, no.

184
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,720
你说得没错  警探
You were right, Detective.

185
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,690
里昂从我们这里偷了一大笔钱
Leon here stole a great deal of money from us,

186
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,780
我们刚要谈完  你就进门了
and we'd just about done talking when you walked in.

187
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,220
我没时间搞这个
Listen, I don't have time for this.

188
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,130
我要去找我的朋友  所以我准备带上里昂
I need to find my friend, so I'm going to take Leon here

189
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,550
然后离开这里
and we're going to leave.

190
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,900
其实  里昂偷的钱太多了
Leon stole more than enough, in fact,

191
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,200
多到杀掉一个警察也值了
to make it worth us killing a cop,

192
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,350
所以咱们来做个交易吧
so maybe we can make a deal.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,990
把里昂留给我们
You leave Leon here with us,

194
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,850
你可以继续去找你的朋友
and you can keep looking for your friend.

195
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,240
这警徽的主人
You know, the guy that owned this badge

196
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,550
应该会愿意跟你做这个交易
probably would have made that deal,

197
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,830
可惜我不是他
But I'm not him.

198
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,260
那你是谁
So who are you?

199
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,870
杀了他然后拿走他警徽的人
The guy who shot him and stole his badge.

200
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,360
你走不走  里昂
You coming or not, Leon?

你不打算帮我找他了哈
You're not gonna help me find him, huh?

伙计  都跟你说了  我不认识你朋友
Dude, I already told you, I don't know your friend.

216
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,010
他把你编程成这样的  是吗
He programmed you to do this, didn't he?

217
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,560
只管继续给我号码
To keep giving me the numbers.

What numbers? Who're you talking to?

看来咱们要走路了
Looks like we're walking.

223
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,310
你到底是什么人  退役军人吗  
What are you, ex-military?

224
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,570
黑水公司神秘特种佣兵吗
One of those Blackwater guys?

225
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,050
有关系吗
Does it matter?

226
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,670

你闯进来时  我正在跟那些家伙谈判
When you butted in, we were in the middle of a negotiation.

231
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,640
谈判一般可不会让你挨枪子
Negotiations don't usually end in bullets,

232
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,190
你那帮朋友是雅利安兄弟会的
and your friends in there were Aryan Brotherhood,

233
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,540
你在偷他们的东西前就该想清楚的
something you should've thought of before you stole from them.

234
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,950
对了  你拿了多少钱
By the way, how much did you take?

八百万
8 million.

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,850
我并没想偷他们钱  至少一开始不想
Look, I didn't plan on stealing, at least not at first.

237

我本来在贝尔斯登投行有份正经工作
I had a legitimate job at Bear Stearns.

后来因为经济危机  我被裁了
Then the recession hit and we all get axed,

239
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,870
然后我在一家新成立的小公司找了工作

243
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,670
你觉得这是贪婪盗窃吗
You wanna call that greedy?

244
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,030
我觉得这是替天行道
I call it payback.

Please, I gotta get out of town,

and I don't have time to babysit you.

等等
Wait!

254

别留我一个人在这
Don't leave me here alone!

卡特在忙着替我调查一桩谋杀案

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,400
而我就得浪费时间盯着这个里昂
and I get stuck wasting my time with this Leon.

267
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,030
你不是宣誓过要尽警察之责保护服务人民吗
Didn't you take an oath as a cop to protect and serve?

268
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,160
-那又怎样  -那就去尽警察之责

国安局分析师有过联系
right before she was killed.

290

我们想把佩克带来  但他有帮手
Tried to bring Peck in, but he had assistance,

291
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,290
可能是我们的人
possibly one of ours.

292
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,030
那人干掉了三人情报监视小组  单枪匹马
He took out a three-man ISA unit... by himself.

293
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,500
-他是谁  -我保证会问他
- Who is he? - I'll be sure and ask him...

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,670

出什么事了  莱奈尔
Something wrong, Lionel?

314
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,680
里昂假装心脏病突发  从警察局逃走了
Leon faked a heart attack, walked right out of the station.

315
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,220
下一次  你得注意着点
You know, next time, you should be a little more careful

316
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,170
能放心把他交给谁

317
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,760
我放心交给了你啊
I entrusted him to you.

318
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,800
你到底要不要我找到他
You want me to find him, or not?

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,430
我告诉你他去了哪儿
I'll tell you where he's gone.

320
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,580
还有  莱奈尔
And Lionel?

321
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,100

我是弗斯科警探  要送你去监狱
I'm Detective Fusco. I'm taking you to jail.

326

你要指控我什么
What are you going to charge me with?

329
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,250
盗窃公共财物还不够  我想想

330
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,900
帮第三帝国纳粹毒贩洗钱怎么样
how about laundering drug money for the Third Reich?

331
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,950
你不能把我关起来  监狱是那些人的地盘
You can't lock me up. These guys own the prisons.

332
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,800
我一晚上都挨不过的
I-I won't last a night in there.

333
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,730
放松点  里昂
Hey, relax, Leon.

334
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,610
你进不了监狱的
You're not gonna make it to prison.

335
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,590
你这位朋友是谁
So who's your friend here?

336
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,060
他不是干掉我们兄弟的那个
He's not the one who took out our boys.

337
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,810
那人应该高高的  西装笔挺
He's supposed to be tall, and, uh, well-dressed.

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,120
我是警察
I'm a cop.

339
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,100
是吗  那个人也这么说
Yeah? That's what the other guy said too.

340
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,730
里昂  我们的钱在哪
Leon, where's our money?

341
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,900
你还是现在  一枪杀了我吧
You might as well just-- just shoot me now.

342
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,100
完全可以办到
That can be arranged.

343
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,360
那笔钱又值不了你的命  小鬼
The money's not worth your life, kid,

344
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,940
当然更值不了我的命
and it sure as hell ain't worth mine.

345
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,920
好吧  在后备箱里
Yeah, in the trunk.

346
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,020
这儿大概有一百万  里昂  其他的呢
There's maybe a million here, Leon, where's the rest?

347
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,930
没了  只有这么多
it's gone, it-- there's nothing left.

348
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
带走他
Bring him.

349
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,760
老实说  我真希望你们带走他
Hey, frankly, I'd be inclined to let you have this guy.

350
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,130
他让我烦透了
He's a pain in my ass,

351
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,070
但他今天已经逃跑了一次
but he's already gotten away once today,

352
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,160
所以现在  这关乎到荣誉问题
So now, it's just a matter of pride.

353
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,680
我不得不带他走
I can't leave here without him.

461
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,270
他的原主人
Guy that had him,

462
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,720
他也没钱给我们
he didn't have our money either.

463
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,420
所以用他的狗来抵债
So he paid with his dog,

464
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,110
还有他的蛋
and his balls.

465
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,680
我得把你留一部分给提图斯
Now, I gotta leave some of you for Titus,

466
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,970
不过我确定他不会介意我先动手
but I'm sure he won't mind if I get a head start.

467
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,200
不  不
No! No!

468
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,110
又在外面给他们找了个伴
Found us another playmate outside.

469
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,100
高高的  西装笔挺的家伙
The tall, well-dressed guy.

470
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,610
你这样子挺美的  莱奈尔
That's a good look for you, Lionel.

471
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,970
你主动过来找事  哥们儿
You come into our house, brother,

472
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,800
居然只带了一把手枪
you better be packing more than just a handgun.

473
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,400
刚和你属下说了  我只想找到我的朋友
Like I told your associate, I just want to find my friend.

474
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,320
我没有什么朋友
See, I don't have many friends.

475
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,980
事实上  只有一个
Just the one, in fact.

476
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,210
好吧  算两个  要不这样
Okay, maybe two. So here's the deal.

477
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,590
你把里昂和弗斯科警探给我
You give me Leon and Detective Fusco here--

478
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,500
口塞不取都行  我会默默离开
you can even leave the gag on-- and I'll go peacefully.

479
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,110
如果我们不同意呢
And what if we say no?

480
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,160
那我今天大概就要练练手了
I guess I get my workout in for the day.

481
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,350
看来屠夫今晚能饱餐一顿了
Oh, looks like Butcher here is gonna eat well tonight.

482
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,110
狗不错
Nice dog.

483
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,460
比利时马里努阿犬
Belgian Malinois.

484
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,610
但你要知道
But you know,

485
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,820
受过训的狗狂叫不是为了示警
trained dogs don't bark in alarm.

486
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,290
-他们狂叫是因为焦虑  -那又怎样
- They bark from anxiety. - Yeah, so?

487
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,750
那很明显  它根本不尊重你
So clearly, it doesn't respect you.

488
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,690
怎么  有什么好笑的
What? Something funny?

489
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,120
我们部队在提克里特的时候也用这个品种
We used the same breed in my unit in Tikrit.

490
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,330
这世界上只有三个人
Only about three guys in the world

491
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,620
训这种狗
that train dogs like this.

492
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,170
好笑的是  那几位
The funny thing is, those guys,

493
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,900
他们只用荷兰语下命令
they only use Dutch commands,

494
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,230
我猜你不会说荷兰语
and I'm guessing you don't speak Dutch.

495
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,200
松开它
Let it loose.

496
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,470
[荷兰语]狗狗  安静
Foei! Stil!

497
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,190
[荷兰语]趴下
Afliggen.

498
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,010
什么都不许说  听见没
Not a word. You hear me?

499
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,380
我们要绝对安静地走回巡逻车
We're going back to my cruiser in total silence.

500
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,800
没问题  莱奈尔  安静得如带口塞
Sure thing, Lionel. Like a gag order.

501
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,840
两位  能不能帮我把手铐打开
Hey, hey, guys, think you could uncuff me?

502
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,610
-不行  -不行
- No! - No!

All right, I guess I've got some bugs to work out with you.

508
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,690

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:02,160
你的职责是保护所有人  不是保护我
Your job is to protect everyone, not to protect me.

513
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,700
我看我们得谈一下基本原则问题了
I guess we're going to have to discuss some ground rules.

514
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,480
我想你误会我了  哈罗德
I think you've got me wrong, Harold.

515
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,250
我并不喜欢杀人
I don't enjoy killing people.

516
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,000
但我也不为杀人而感到愧疚
But I don't feel very bad about it, either.

517
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,250
女士
Ma'am.

518
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,910
我小的时候
When I was a kid,

519
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,130
感觉电脑比人更亲切
computers made more sense to me than people.

520
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,360
我猜你也是
I bet you were the same way.

521
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,900
拿这个女人来说
Take this woman--

522
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,270
她看上去是个好人
she looks nice enough,

523
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,100
但她偷税漏税  嗑止疼药上瘾
but she lies on her taxes, she's addicted to painkillers,

524
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,030
多年来  她一直跟一名有妇之夫上床
And for years she's been sleeping with a married man.

525
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,130
我真是笨手笨脚的
Oh, I am so clumsy.

526
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,540
-给你  -非常感谢
- Here you go. - Thank you so much.

527
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,800
她没事的
She'll be just fine...

528
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,500
只要一两个月
in a month or two.

529
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,570
如果你坚持的话  有很多更难看的方法
And there are messier ways to do this, if you insist.

530
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,910
她和这些事有什么关系
What's she got to do with any of this?

531
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,730
有一天  我意识到
One day, I realized,

532
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,360
所有别人做的愚蠢自私的事
all the dumb, selfish things people do--

533
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,100
都不是我们的过错
it's not our fault.

534
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,490
没有人设计出我们
No one designed us.

535
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,020
我们都是意外  哈罗德
We're just an accident, Harold.

536
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,820
我们只是错误代码
We're just bad code.

537
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,240
但是你所建的
But the thing you built...

538
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,490
非常完美
it's perfect.

539
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,680
合理  美丽  精心设计的
Rational. Beautiful. By design.

540
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,770
我造的只是一台机器
What I made is just a machine,

541
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,240
一个系统  仅此而已
a system, and that's all.

542
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,620
我不这么认为  哈罗
I don't think so, Harry.

543
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,180
你骗过了内森  但我知道真相
You may have fooled Nathan, but I know the truth.

544
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,040
要做出能理解人类行为的东西
If you want to make something that understands human behavior,

545
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,580
至少要它和人类一样聪明
it has to be at least as smart as a human.

546
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,520
你创造的是智慧体
You created an intelligence,

547
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,940
是生命
a life,

548
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,430
然后你抹消了它的声音
and then you ripped out its voice,

549
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,820
把它关进笼子里  交给了
locked it in a cage, and handed it over

550
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,270
那群最可笑最腐败的人
to the most laughably corrupt people imaginable.

551
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,850
快打911
Call 911.

552
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,600
快找人帮忙
Call somebody!

553
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,180
女士
Ma'am?

554
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,380
在想你

555
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,380
想念你  亲

556
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,380
等不及想见你了

557
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,760
在想你

558
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,760
想念你  亲

559
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,760
等不及想见你了

560
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,430
在想你

561
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,430
想念你  亲

562
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,430
等不及想见你了

563
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,660
来吧  哈罗德  该走了
Come on, Harold. It's time to go.

564
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,050
情况紧急  需要现在见你
我们的地盘见

565
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,360
你看起来不像屠夫噢
You don't look like a butcher.

566
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,640
它看起来绝对像屠夫
It looks exactly like a butcher.

567
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,070
你是个甜心宝贝
You're a sweetheart.

568
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,880
只需要改个好点的名字
You just need a better name.

569
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,840
我们能专注于我的问题吗  拜托
Hey, can we focus on me, please?

570
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,160
我会开车送你去机场
I'll get you to the airport,

571
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,230
花一点你的不义之财
spend a little of your ill-gotten gains

572
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,210
给你买一张离开这里的单程票
and buy you a one-way ticket out of town.

573
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,350
卡特  你找了到什么
Yeah, Carter. What do you got?

574
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,430
一条可能的线索
Possible lead.

575
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,370
我又去了一趟欧文・雷诺兹的公寓
I went by Owen Reynolds's apartment again,

576
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,940
就是卖驾照给根的那个人
the guy who sold Root her license.

577
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,930
还没有他的消息  但是我看了他的邮件
Still no sign of him, but I got his mail.

578
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,870
几乎都是垃圾邮件  不过有一张仓库的
Mostly junk, but there is an overdue bill

579
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,520
催讨过期账款
for a storage unit,

580
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,710
在百老汇和珍珠大街交界处
Broad Street and Pearl.

581
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,200
我这就赶过去  谢谢
I'm on it, thanks.

582
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,760
你刚才错过了出口
Hey, you just missed the exit for the tunnel.

583
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,030
计划有变
Change of plans.

584
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,420
他在哪儿
Where is he?

585
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,260
一名西装男把他带走了
Some guy in a suit took him.

586
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,280
每个人都给我出去找  明白吗
I want everyone out looking, understand?

587
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,000
今晚就干掉他们俩
Those two die tonight.

588
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,820
我可以自己开车去机场
I can drive myself to the airport.

589
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,890
我必须走
I gotta get lost.

590
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,440
每次我放你走  你都差点死掉
Every time I let you go, you almost end up dead.

591
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,130
我快没时间找我的朋友了
I'm running out of time to find my friend,

592
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,090
现在我只有一条线索
and I've only got one lead left,

593
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,930
所以我调查的时候  你要非常努力地
so you're gonna try very hard not to get killed

594
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,160
保住自己的命
while I look into it.

595
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,250
明白吗
Do you understand?

596
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,440
那我们就陷入僵局了
Then we're at a stalemate,

597
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,920
因为我绝不会下车
'cause I'm not getting out of this car.

598
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,770
你态度很不好
You know, you got a bad attitude.

599
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,140
我的钱
Hey, my money!

600
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,100
那狗会杀死任何一个靠近那堆债券的人
That dog'll kill anyone that tries to get near those bonds...

601
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,520
包括你
including you.

602
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,120
天啊
Oh, man.

603
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,550
他  他是不是  他
Is--is he--is he--?

604
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,920
是的  他死了  里昂  死得透透的
Yes, he's dead, Leon. Very dead.

605
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,830
谁干的
Who did this?

606
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,910
抓走我朋友的那个人
Same person who took my friend.

607
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,880
他看到了她的脸  她必须杀了他
He saw her face, she had to kill him.

608
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,910
但是她之前一定付过他钱
But she would have had to have paid him up front.

609
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,860
坐下  里昂
Have a seat, Leon.

610
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,120
什么  绝不  干什么
What? No way. Why?

611
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,600
因为你擅长藏钱
Because you're good at hiding money.

612
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,710
如果那女人留下了线索  你肯定能找到她
If this woman left a trail, well, you can find her.

613
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,230
有件事我想知道  里昂
Something I've been wondering, Leon.

614
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,810
那笔钱其余的部分你怎么处理了
What happened to the rest of the money you took?

615
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,010
投资了  股市暴跌
I invested it. Stock tanked.

616
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,500
天  我有发现了
Oh, man. I found something.

617
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,410
好的  有笔钱转进了雷诺兹的账户
All right, a transfer into this guy Reynolds's account,

618
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,860
但是钱被偷了
only the money was stolen.

619
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,100
-谁转过来的  -雷诺兹自己
- From who? - Reynolds.

620
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,440
看起来像是她安装了
It looks like she installed

621
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,920
某种实时屏幕监视器
some type of real-time screen monitor

622
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,420
黑进了他的账户
to hack into his account.

623
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,020
你是说  她用这人自己的钱付给他吗
You're saying she paid the man with his own money?

624
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,280
无路可查  这是个死循环
There's nothing to trace. It's a loop.

625
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,850
也许我需要找个更在行的人来
Maybe I need to find someone better.

626
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,270
没有人比我更在行了
There is no one better,

627
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,860
也许  除了这名黑客
except maybe this hacker.

628
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,220
她简直是艺术家  无可追踪
She's an artist. There's nothing to track her,

629
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,580
甚至无从下手
there's nowhere to even begin.

630
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,550
约翰  我们有麻烦了
John, we got a problem.

631
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,130
为什么我一点都不惊讶
Why am I not surprised?

632
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,070
考文的卷宗不见了
Corwin's case file is missing.

633
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,650
数据记录被损坏
Digital records have been corrupted

634
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,660
弹道报告也是
and the ballistics report.

635
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,590
技术支持说系统有故障
Tech support says the system has a bug.

636
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,550
我会去查查  但是
I'll look into it, but...

637
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,580
约翰  我觉得我们已经没得查了
John, I don't think we have anything else to go on.

638
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,450
老兄
Dude.

639
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,150
如果哈罗德还在外面
If Harold is still out there,

640
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,800
我不知道该怎么找到他
I don't know how to find him.

641
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,020
约翰
John?

642
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,710
你到底在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

643
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,110
我不干了
I'm not doing this anymore.

644
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,730
我不动了  除非你给条路让我找到他
I'm not going anywhere until you give me a way to find him.

645
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,350
别又来了
Not this again.

646
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,980
如果我必须一直救这种白痴的命
If I'm supposed to keep saving people like this idiot,

647
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,190
你得给我回报
I want something in return.

648
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,880
否则  我就不干了
Otherwise, I'm done.

649
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,180
你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

650
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,070
这帮人会杀了我们的
These guys are going to kill us!

651
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,900
应该会
They probably are.

652
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,260
那这是干什么
So what the hell is this?

653
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,380
谈判
A negotiation.

654
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,830
我知道你有你的原则
I know you've got your rules,

655
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,750
不过那里边肯定没包括
but I'm guessing they don't account

656
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,010
所有人都死了怎么办
for everybody being dead.

657
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,160
没人接你的电话
No one answering your phone calls.

658
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,610
没人去救人
No one saving anyone.

659
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,570
没有应急预案
No contingency.

660
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,060
你想要怎样啊
What do you want?

661
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
要我放弃那些债券
You want me to give up the bonds?

662
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,080
放弃那些钱  没问题
Give all the money away? It's done.

663
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,030
我们得走了  快
We just have to move, now!

664
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,530
算吧  想办法绕过你的原则
Do the math, and figure out a way to bend your rules,

665
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,250
他是我的朋友
'cause he's my friend.

666
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,920
他拯救了我  明白吗
He saved my life. Understand?

667
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,380
没有他  我不会继续下去
And I won't do this without him.

668
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,270
阿亚库乔  高尔夫

671
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,890
谢谢
Thank you.

672
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,140
-那是谁  -说来话长  走
- Who was that? - Long story. Let's go!

673
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,000
什么事
Yeah?

674
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,030
你还真不好找  丹顿
You're a hard man to locate, Denton.

675
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,480
谨慎而已
Just being cautious.

676
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,410
谨慎是件好事
It's good to be cautious.

677
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,720
艾丽西娅・考文就很谨慎  当然  也没保住命
Alicia Corwin was cautious. Of course, it didn't save her.

678
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,020
找我有什么事
What can I do for you?

679
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,830
我的人阻止了考文案的调查
My operative is making the Corwin investigation go away.

680
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,380
很高兴听到这个
Glad to hear it.

681
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,970
小心点  丹顿
Look out for yourself, Denton.

682
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,760
我们已经死了一个人
One of us is already dead.

683
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,070
我不想再有人送命
I'd hate to lose any more.

684
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,240
我有点私事
I have a personal situation.

685
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,030
最近几天可能会联系不上
I might be out of reach for a few days.

686
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,980
丹顿  我们总能联系上你
Denton, we can always reach you.

687
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,490
人呢
Where are they?

688
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,250
-他们进去了  -走
- They're somewhere in there. - Let's go.

689
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,540
走吧  快离开
Go on. Get out of here.

690
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,220
-我会拖住他们  -好的
- I'll keep 'em busy. - Yeah, okay.

691
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,270
约翰
John--

692
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,140
以后再谢我吧
You can thank me later.

693
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,820
-钱在哪里  -没了
- Where's the money? - It's gone.

694
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,850
那对你来说可是坏消息
That's bad news for you.

695
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,230
找个体型相当的对手吧
Pick on someone your own size,

696
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,180
差那么一点的也行
or someone a little closer to it.

697
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,950
你真令你的同族蒙羞
You're an embarrassment to your race.

698
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,590
{\an8}雅利安兄弟会是种族主义者  推崇白人至上

699
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,590
当我们崛起
When we rise up--

700
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,550
我一直想把这个还给你
I've been meaning to get this back to you.

701
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,910
谢了
Thank you.

702
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,620
你打架居然能输
Never thought I'd see you almost lose.

703
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,020
我那不叫输  叫中场休息
Yeah, I wasn't losing. I was just resting.

704
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,840
起来
Come on.

705
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,210
至少有人是高兴的
At least somebody's happy.

706
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,520
高兴过头了吧
A little too happy.

707
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,410
你没在里面上厕所  是吗
You didn't go to the bathroom in there, did you?

708
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,760
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

709
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,430
我的钱  它吃掉了无记名债券
My money. It ate the bearer bonds.

710
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,360
就是这个  就叫他"小熊"[音同"无记名"]
That's it. We'll call him "Bear".

711
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,420
你不是说它不会让任何人碰钱吗
I thought you said it wouldn't let anyone near the money.

712
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,900
这么想吧
Look at it this way,

713
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,770
你破产了  不过你还活着
You're broke, but you're alive.

714
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,560
当然了  除非你说
Unless, of course, you lied to those guys

715
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,270
弄丢了其他的钱是在骗他们
about losing the rest of their money.

716
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,900
没有  我  我非常确定
No, I'm-- I'm pretty certain.

717
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,620
80%确定
Like 80% certain.

718
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,530
或许是75%
Maybe 75% cer--

719
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,470
你的朋友
Your friend...

720
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,070
希望你能找到他
I hope you find him.

721
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,670
他有你  真幸运
He's lucky to have you.

722
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,290
14岁女孩失踪

723
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,980
早
Morning.

724
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,230
你开玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

725
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,710
我有芬奇的线索
I got a lead on Finch.

726
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,680
你知道我们的神秘女要去哪儿吗
You know where our mystery woman's headed?

727
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,150
不  但我知道了她从哪儿来的
No, but I think I found out where she's from.

728
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,550
收拾东西  卡特  我们要去德克萨斯
Pack your bags, Carter. We're going to Texas.

729
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,220
你肯定饿了
You must be starving.

730
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,180
我们的朋友一会儿就到
Our friend will be here shortly,

731
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,770
到时候我会给你弄些吃的
and then I'll fix you something to eat.

732
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,620
我没有登陆系统的权限
I have no way of accessing it, you know.

733
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,680
我采取措施确保了这点
I made sure of that.

734
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,750
任何事物都有漏洞
Everything has a flaw.

735
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,970
你知道的  哈罗德
You know that, Harold,

736
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,400
就像我说过的
and like I told you,

737
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,180
我特别擅长发现漏洞
I'm awfully good at finding them.

738
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,410
为什么  你能从中得到什么
Why? What could you possibly want from it?

739
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,890
和你一样
The same thing you did.

740
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,160
你或许告诉自己你是在帮助人们
You may have told yourself you were helping people,

741
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,380
不过  你造机器的真正原因是
but the real reason you built the machine

742
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,100
这个世界太无聊了
is because the world is boring.

743
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,570
人类的发展已经到了极限
Human beings have come as far as we're gonna go.

744
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,290
我想看看接下来会发生什么
I want to see what happens next.

745
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,670
你说得对  我们很像
You're right, you and I are alike...

746
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,780
在很多方面  我真不愿意承认
in many ways-- not that I'd care to admit it.

747
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,730
我总也搞不懂为什么人们会那么残忍
I spent years wondering how people could be so cruel,

748
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,930
卑劣  自私
petty, so selfish--

749
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,430
后来我开始想要如何改变他们
And then I'd think about how you could change them,

750
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,010
教化他们
fix them.

751
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,830
所以我才把机器封住
And that's why I've sealed up the machine.

752
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,620
不是为了防备我将机器交付给的那些人
Not to protect it from the people I was giving it to...

753
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,910
而是为了防备我自己  防备像我们一样的人
to protect it from me, from people like us,

754
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,670
防备我们想要用它做的事
from the things we'd do with it.

755
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,800
所以我永远不会帮你控制它
That's why I'll never help you get control of it.

756
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,670
我知道
I know.

757
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,900
你不必
You won't have to.

758
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,100
因为  哈罗德
Because, you see, Harold,

759
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,100
我并不想控制你的机器
I don't want to control your machine.

760
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,460
宝贝  我收到你的信息了
Hi, honey. I got your message.

761
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,510
还好吧
Is everything okay?

762
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,920
我只想要放它自由
I just want to set it free.
