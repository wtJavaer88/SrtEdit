00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,770
卡尔・比彻的事
All that business about Cal Beecher...

158
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,910
你了解什么
What do you know?

159
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,060
我干我这行也很久了
Been doing my job for a long time too.

160
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,250
没有内务部档案的情况下  我只能猜测
And not having those IAB files, I can only surmise,

161
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,290
他们亮起那么多红灯
but the kind of red flags they put up,

162
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,020
比彻有大麻烦
Beecher is bad news.

163
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,660
避开吧  卡特
Steer clear, Carter.

164
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,290
我是费伊特工
This is Special Agent Fahey.

165
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,650
我是纽约警局的卡特警探
This is Detective Carter of the NYPD.

166
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,840
我在查一些失踪人员的档案
I've been looking through some missing person files

167
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,060
上面有你的笔记
that have your notes on them.

168
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,510
这些案子有一点共同之处
The cases were connected through one potential MO,

169
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,750
那些消失或损毁的照片
something about missing or destroyed photos

170
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,910
你在多处犯罪现场都发现了
you uncovered at more than one potential crime scene.

171
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,560
这一模式你有没有查到新线索
Have you been able to chase down any new leads on that MO?

172
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,130
我在华盛顿总部工作  警探
I work out of headquarters in DC, Detective.

173
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,270
我不追查线索  我只写报告
I don't chase leads. I write reports...

174
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,580
还没人看
that no one reads.

175
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,200
好吧  但我有个线人
Right. But I might have a new informant

176
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,530
有关于本案的新信息
with additional information for this case.

177
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,880
我是几个月前整理那些信息的
Well, I put all that information together months ago.

178
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,380
当时我打电话给纽约警局
I called the NYPD at the time. 

179
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,890
没人帮得上忙
No one there was helpful.

180
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,420
没人有其他信息
No one had anything to add.

181
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,500
现在突然冒出新的消息了
Now something suddenly just popped up?

182
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,740
是保密消息来源
It's a confidential source.

183
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,330
对联调局保密  想得美
Confidential from the FBI? Nice try.

184
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,400
如果有新消息打给局里联络处
Call the bureau liaison if you have any new information,

185
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,620
不然就再见了
otherwise have a nice day.

186
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,380
恭喜你有新
Congratulations on your new...

187
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,080
{\pos(193,180)}欧文岛

188
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,600
他们在疏散这个岛  芬奇
They're evacuating the island, Finch.

189
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,730
但我还是到了洛林斯租下的房子
But I made it out to Rollins' rental house.

190
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,020
你在哪
Where are you?

191
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,730
我回到了布鲁克林  洛林斯的家里
Well, I'm back at Rollins' in Brooklyn.

192
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,560
在黑暗里摸索
Bumping around in the dark.

193
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,310
风暴毁了楼下的变压器
Storm knocked out a transformer down on the street

194
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,620
周围九个街区全部断电
and all power within a nine-block radius.

195
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,890
干嘛又回去
Why go back there?

196
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,200
卡特警探和一名联调局特工聊了聊
Detective Carter spoke with an FBI agent

197
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,370
他发现了那些案件有个模式
who's discovered a pattern in the crimes.

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,320
那些失踪人员的家里都没有照片
There were no photographs of the missing persons at their homes.

199
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,520
所以我在查看照片  到底有没有
So I'm looking for photos, or a lack thereof.

200
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,920
这是什么
What's this?

201
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,200
地下储藏室
"Basement storage."

202
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,970
得下楼看看了  小熊
I'm gonna take a look downstairs, Bear.

203
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,610
没什么可担心的
Nothing to worry about.

204
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,610
空相框  和其他人一样
Empty photo frames. Just like the others.

205
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,420
里瑟先生  我在洛林斯的地下室有发现
Mr. Reese, I've found something interesting in Rollins' basement.

206
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,790
芬奇  我听不见
Finch, I didn't copy.

207
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,360
芬奇
Finch?

208
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,590
芬奇
Finch?

209
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,300
这儿还有别人
I'm not alone.

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,560
小熊
Bear?

211
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,730
你在干什么
What are you doing?

212
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,610
什么东西
What is it?

213
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,630
里瑟先生  我想我弄明白了
Mr. Reese, I think I know what happened

214
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,120
那些失踪的人出了什么事
to all those missing people.

215
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,390
联调局  不许动
FBI, don't move.

216
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,130
举起手来  拿出身份证明
Hands up. I want to see some ID.

217
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,940
到底哪个
Well, which is it?

218
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,670
是要我举起手  还是要看身份证明
You want my hands up, or you want to see ID?

219
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,640
詹宁斯  美国法警
Jennings. US Marshals Service.

220
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,500
我在找一个人  名叫洛林斯
I'm trying to locate someone, a guy named Rollins.

221
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,390
有些问题要问他
Got some questions for him.

222
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,810
你在找洛林斯  我也是
You looking for Rollins? Me too.

223
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,910
我确信他和
I believe he's connected to--

224
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,520
和其他失踪案有关
To another missing persons case.

225
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,480
我们相信有一名通缉逃犯在找洛林斯
We believe a wanted fugitive may be looking for Rollins.

226
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,710
他在这儿吗
Is he here?

227
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,110
我不知道  才刚开始找
I don't know. I just started looking.

228
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,530
我们何不放下武器
Well, why don't we take our weapons off each other

229
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,580
搜查这栋房子
and clear this house?

230
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,770
洛林斯一案有新发现
Trail was hot on Rollins,

231
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,280
但总部没人能腾出手来  跟进线索
but no one at HQ would get off their hands, follow up the lead.

232
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
我就决定亲自看看
So I decided to come out here myself.

233
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,140
你一个人来的吗
You out here all alone?

234
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,430
虽然从匡提科毕业好多年了
Well, it's been a few years since Quantico,

235
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,740
但我还记得点儿外勤工作
but I remember a thing or two about working in the field.

236
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,870
这条线索你跟对了
Well, you're on the right trail.

237
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,460
洛林斯最近在这待过
Rollins was here recently, 

238
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,000
顶着这种风暴他也走不远
he couldn't have gotten far in this storm.

239
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,790
我车就在外面
My car is outside.

240
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,190
不如去当地警局吧
Why don't we head to the local police station?

241
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,860
我们需要更多人手
We're gonna need a few more guys on this.

242
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,930
有人想销毁牙齿
Someone tried to destroy these teeth.

243
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,760
但温度不够没烧化牙釉
But the flame wasn't hot enough to burn enamel.

244
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,900
可能要花点时间  不过
It could take some time, but...

245
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,290
如果死者有牙医记录
if the vic's dentals are on file,

246
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,750
就能查到他的身份
we could get an ID.

247
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,090
不行  我们没时间等
No, we can't wait that long.

248
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,380
如果那些牙是杰克・洛林斯的
Assuming that the teeth belong to Jack Rollins,

249
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,350
牙取下之前他应该已经死了
he was likely dead when they were removed.

250
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,480
倒也但愿如此
One would hope so, anyway.

251
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,160
凶手肯定很清楚怎么处理尸体
Well, whoever did this knows how to get rid of a body.

252
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,290
他们不只要他的命
They didn't just want to kill Rollins,

253
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,760
还要他彻底消失
they wanted him to disappear.

254
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,550
我们调查的不是单纯的连环失踪
We may be looking at more than a string of missing persons.

255
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,380
我们调查的是连环谋杀
We may be looking at a string of murders.

256
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
六个受害人
Six victims.

257
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,360
如果凶手能假装受害者的身份
If our killer can assume these identities,

258
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,560
那他应该冒充了这些失踪者
then he would be a composite of all these missing persons

259
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,020
而且不止一次了
in more ways than one.

260
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,580
我们调查的是连环杀手
We're looking at a serial killer.

261
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,750
芬奇  你在干什么
Finch, what are you doing?

262
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,200
里瑟在岛上找的人凶残至极
Mr. Reese is out on an island looking for a man violent enough

263
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,880
不惜拔掉人的牙齿
to pull out another man's teeth.

264
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,250
我无法警告他  只能亲自过去
And now I can't warn him. I have to get there myself.

265
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,700
去岛上的路肯定都封死了
I'm pretty sure all the roads are closed now.

266
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,120
你怎么能过去呢
How do you think you're gonna get out there?

267
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,950
用飞行执照
Think I'll use my pilot's license.

268
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,110
飓风马上就到
I got a nor'easter touching down right now.

269
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,000
岛上还有357个居民
I've got a population of 357 souls,

270
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,460
需要我撤离这岛  否则就来不及了
I've got to get off this island before I can't anymore.

271
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,740
警长已经在内陆负责疏散了
Chief of police is running the evacuation on the mainland.

272
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,950
这被水淹掉的小镇上就我一个警察了
I'm the law left in the town with half its ass underwater.

273
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,780
这是联邦要案
This is a matter of federal importance.

274
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,550
-我们要找这个人  -不认识
- We're looking for this man. - Don't recognize him.

275
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,470
他要是在这租房的  估计已经疏散了
But if he was a renter, he's probably been evacuated.

276
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,340
警长  警长  请回答
Chief? Chief, come in.

277
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,490
不介意我们打几个电话吧
Mind if we at least make a few phone calls while we are here?

278
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,010
当然
Sure.

279
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,180
只要手机和座机还能通
If the cell and land lines weren't down,

280
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,500
电还没停
the power wasn't out,

281
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,250
应急无线电还没赶在今天不能用了
and the emergency radio didn't pick today to crap out on me.

282
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,910
-还要别的吗  -要  这儿咖啡如何
- Anything else? - Yeah. How's your coffee?

283
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,990
先生们  虽然你们有管辖权
Hey, gents, you may have jurisdiction and authority here,

284
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,310
但你们不会有我的协助
but one thing you don't have is my cooperation.

285
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,550
现在  天是老大
For now, mother nature takes priority.

286
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,940
法警  我们不能傻坐在这里
Look, Marshal, we can't afford to sit around here

287
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,760
副警长不帮忙也一样
with or without the deputy's help.

288
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,010
我们调查的不是单纯的一起失踪
I don't think we're on the trail of just a missing person here.

289
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,330
我认为洛林斯已经死了  而且还不止他一个
I think Rollins is dead, and he may not be the only one.

290
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,520
我们在查的是个冷血的连环杀手
I think we're on the trail of a cold-blooded killer.

291
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,600
你之前怎么不说
You didn't want to share this earlier?

292
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,170
我也不确定
Well, I didn't know all the facts.

293
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,220
严格说来  这只是我的猜想
Technically, it's still just a theory.

294
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,630
话说  你知道毁尸灭迹吗
Tell me, what do you know about making a body disappear?

295
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,870
这里成空城了
This place is a ghost town.

296
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,090
是啊  我们局都执行风暴巡逻去了
Yeah. Our uni's are out on storm patrol.

297
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,370
你为什么过来
What brings you down here?

298
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,000
为你
You.

299
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,490
我想过打电话  不过你不接  是吧
I would have called, but you're not answering those, are you?

300
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,840
我就想亲自看看
So I decided to drop by,

301
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,180
也许你能告诉我  我做错了什么
and maybe you could tell me what I did wrong.

302
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,810
卡尔  我正忙着呢  以后再说
Cal, I'm working on something. I'll talk when I can.

303
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,340
那我回头再来
I guess I'll check in later.

304
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,150
你是怎么困在这岛上的
So how'd you get stuck on the island?

305
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,200
消声器进水了  引擎发动不了
We got water in the muffler and the engine died,

306
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,420
于是就到这了  卡莉和我
so we came here-- Carly and I.

307
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,670
这是我的新娘  卡莉
That's my new bride Carly over there.

308
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,420
我们刚刚结婚  都是牙科保健员
We just got married. We're both dental hygienists.

309
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,690
-这点我说过吗  -是的
- Did I say that? - Yes.

310
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,450
你之前说不止洛林斯一个人是什么意思
What did you mean earlier when you said Rollins wasn't the only one?

311
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,840
我认为我们在查的是连环犯罪
I think we're on the trail of several crimes.

312
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,510
我在调查分布在多个州的多起谋杀案
I'm looking at multiple murders across multiple states.

313
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,930
凶手肯定是先占用了受害人的身份
The killer must have taken the identity of his victim

314
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,850
然后才转向下一个目标
before moving on.

315
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,390
我一路追查到斯坦福的那个学生
I followed the trail back to that student at Stanford,

316
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,540
再查下去
then I worked forward.

317
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,980
发现每个受害人都是先搬迁至其他城市
It turns out every victim of the killer moved cities

318
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,450
然后在18个月之内就消失了
within 18 months of vanishing.

319
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,460
洛林斯搬到了纽约
Rollins moved to New York.

320
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,290
我就去了纽约  发现了租赁凭单
So I went to New York, found the rental bill.

321
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,860
跟着他到了欧文岛
Followed him out here to Owen Island.

322
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,970
那个盗用洛林斯身份出行的人
Whoever was traveling as Rollins

323
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,920
可能还在这个岛上
could easily still be on this island.

324
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,530
艾瑞卡  桥被淹没了
Erica, we just lost the bridge.

325
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,200
什么时候的事  斯坦
When did this happen, Stan?

326
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,330
几分钟之前
A few minutes ago.

327
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,110
我锁了酒吧
I locked up the bar,

328
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,020
看到贝基刚搞定A&P[连锁超市]的告示牌
I saw Becky finishing the boards on the A&P.

329
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,360
我们冲向大桥
We high-tailed it down to the bridge,

330
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,900
正好看到它被淹
just in time to see it go under.

331
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,090
退潮之前绝对过不去
No crossing it until the tides go down.

332
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,000
-这家伙又是谁  -丹尼斯・坎宁安
- And who's this guy? - Dennis Cunningham.

333
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,410
选错日子视察酒店
I picked a bad day to check up on my hotel.

334
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,160
所以是你在建那酒店了
So you're the guy building that hotel?

335
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,470
在天气好的时候
On my drier days.

336
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,340
我们已经开工90天了
We're 90 days out on that property.

337
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,510
-如果全被冲走了  -还有别人
- If it washes away-- - - There's more.

338
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,810
我们在过来的路上看到了
On the way here, we saw someone.

339
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,990
在码头那里
Down by the docks.

340
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,150
看起来像是准备离开岛吗
Did it look like it was trying to get off the island?

341
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,190
像是在自己备船
Looked like he was prepping a boat for himself.

342
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,640
我们得过去一趟
We have to get down there.

343
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,450
这里有五名滞留居民
I've now got five stranded people

344
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,490
我才不离开
and no way off this rock,

345
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,020
这才是我该待的地方
this is where I need to be.

346
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,350
当然  副警长
Absolutely, deputy.

347
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,460
所以我们去替你带他回来
So we'll go and bring him back here for you.

348
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,810
什么怪人会冒着生命危险
Special kind of man ricks his life

349
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,780
在这种天气出海捕鱼
in this weather for a few crustaceans.

350
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,710
伙计们  我只是个渔民
Whoa, fellas, I'm just a fisherman.

351
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,310
这一网下来可值不少钱
There's a lot of money in this haul.

352
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,280
我不知道这也犯法
I didn't know I was breaking a law.

353
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,670
你的身份证呢
You have ID?

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
在水上可没人要看它
Don't get asked for it on the water.

355
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,500
-你叫什么名字  -伊森・马特森
- What's your name? - Ethan Mattson.

356
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,980
伊森  你现在是在岸上
Well, Ethan, you're on land now.

357
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,460
-你跟谁在一起  -没别人
- Who's with you? - No one.

358
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,160
我知道你在那儿
I know you're there.

359
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,950
我这儿有15发子弹
I've got 15 shots here.

360
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,590
想想清楚
Think it over.

361
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,530
不要开枪
No need for shooting!

362
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,400
我只是想要逃离这风暴
I was just looking to get away from this storm is all!

363
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,390
你住在岛上吗
You from the island?

364
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,940
不  我想找个船上的工作
No, I was looking for some work on the boats.

365
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,060
被风暴困在这里了
Got stuck out here by the storm,

366
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,560
以为可以坐船出去
thought I'd ride it out.

367
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,060
把他们俩都带回警局
Let's get them both back to the station.

368
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,220
我不管你是谁
I don't care who you are,

369
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,940
都不能危害居民
you can't endanger my citizens

370
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,070
在镇中心强行迫降塞斯纳飞机
by landing your Cessna in the middle of my town.

371
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,490
那其实是德哈维兰海狸水上飞机
That actually a de Havilland Beaver.

372
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,760
怎么回事
What's going on here?

373
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,110
这个业余风暴追逐者
This amateur storm chaser

374
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,830
哈罗德・格尔被捕了
Harold Gull is under arrest.

375
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,330
他把水上飞机降落在了镇广场
He landed his float plane in the town square.

376
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,920
我需要一片水来降落  那里刚好
I needed a stretch of water to land and there was, well,

377
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,250
全是水
water everywhere.

378
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,630
-这些又是什么  -我的气象设备
- And what's all this? - My meteorological equipment.

379
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,590
我是全国风暴追逐者
I've been a certified member of the National Storm Chasers

380
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,120
及观测者协会十年的注册会员
and Spotters Association for over ten years.

381
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,060
副警长  虽然他很鲁莽
Deputy, despite this man's recklessness,

382
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,700
但你能等到风暴之后再治他的罪吗
could you book him with endangering our lives after the storm?

383
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,690
我们有更重要的事要解决
We have bigger things to worry about.

384
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,570
好吧
Fine.

385
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,370
但风暴过去
But when the storm ends,

386
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,300
我要狠狠收拾他
I'm hitting him with everything I've got.

387
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,530
斯坦  天开始黑了
Hey, Stan, it's getting dark out there.

388
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
你能给后面的发电机
You think you could put some more diesel

389
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,840
加点柴油吗
in the gennie out back?

390
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,510
好的
Yeah.

391
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,810
全国风暴追逐者协会  哈罗德
The National Storm Chasers Association, Harold?

392
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,220
管用啊  不是吗
Well, it worked, didn't it?

393
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,640
我们之前错了  这并不是犯罪团伙
We were wrong. This isn't a group conspiracy.

394
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,210
那些号码  他们都死了
Those numbers, they're all dead.

395
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,420
我们追踪的是凶手
And we're tracking their killer.

396
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,620
我知道
I know.

397
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,980
我不幸看到了
I had the displeasure of seeing

398
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,190
真正杰克・洛林斯的残骸  只剩下臼齿
all that was left of the real Jack Rollins, molars and all.

399
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,770
变态的战利品
Some twisted mind's idea of a trophy.

400
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,030
要是机器给出这六个号码是想告诉我们
What if the machine sent us all six numbers to tell us

401
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,460
有人一直在假扮那些人
that someone had been all of those people?

402
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,630
要是那个聪明的杀人犯感兴趣的不止是
What if a smart killer was interested not only

403
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,320
夺走性命  还有他们的身份
in taking lives, but in taking identities.

404
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,330
就像变色龙
Like a chameleon.

405
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,800
假扮成受害者  过他们的生活
Changing into his victims, living their lives

406
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,330
直到他厌倦了  就去找下一个目标
until he gets bored and moves on to the next.

407
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,840
要想找出这种杀手  我们需要考虑
To identify such a killer, we would want to consider

408
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,510
他曾是谁  他可能长什么样
who he has been, and what he might look like.

409
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,330
好吧  要如何辨认出
Okay, so how do you spot someone

410
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,570
擅长扮演别人的人呢
who's that good at being anyone else?

411
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,900
打扰下  法警
Excuse me, Marshal.

412
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,800
那个联调局的家伙叫你去下后面
That FBI guy needs to see you out back.

413
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,390
快来看这个  斯坦利扑灭的火
You need to see this. Stanley put them out.

414
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,380
有人想用柴油把这堆烧掉
Someone used diesel to try to cook the pile.

415
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,730
几分钟前凶手还在这儿
The killer was here minutes ago.

416
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,300
他近在咫尺
He's close.

417
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,930
而且他抛弃了"洛林斯"的身份
And he's shed the "Rollins" identity.

418
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,730
那他可能是里边的任何人
Then he could be anyone in there.

419
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,900
如果凶手就在他们之中
If the killer is among these people,

420
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,080
那他现在会很不自在  这打破了他的模式
then he's out of his element-- he's broken his pattern.

421
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,770
假设顶替受害者的身份  就是他的固有模式
Assuming the identities of his victims, it's part of his ritual.

422
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,390
现在洛林斯的身份证已烧毁
And now that Rollins' ID is burned,

423
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,520
他被困住了
he's trapped.

424
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,150
他肯定假扮了别的身份
He must have taken on another identity.

425
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,670
而顶着那身份他无处可去
And he can't go anywhere with it.

426
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,320
他跟我们一样困在这里
He's as stuck as we are.

427
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,720
为何机器不给我们他真实的身份
Why didn't the machine give us his real identity?

428
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,910
为什么玩游戏
Why play games?

429
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,280
我估计是他很聪明
I assume he's smart, 

430
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,330
他删除了他的原始数据
and he digitally erased his original persona.

431
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,700
我就删了
I did.

432
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,150
我们要想办法找到他
Well, we need to find a way to hunt him.

433
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,450
也许我们可以  里瑟先生
We might be able to, Mr. Reese.

434
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
你了解风暴追逐吗
Are you familiar with storm chasing?

435
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,480
你在看什么
What are you watching?

436
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,640
我不知道你仍然忙得没空跟我说话
Didn't know if you were still too busy to talk to me.

437
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,850
其实  我正好需要多双眼睛帮我看看
Actually, I could use another set of eyes on something.

438
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,720
你看看
Take a look.

439
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,620
这是六个月前芝加哥一栋大楼的安保摄像头
This is a building-owned security camera in Chicago six months ago.

440
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,020
这是我在查的一个失踪人口
A missing persons I'm working.

441
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,070
这人叫洛林斯
Guy named Rollins.

442
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,100
这是他正在离店
This is him leaving his shop,

443
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,930
这是他第二天回来的画面
and him coming back the next day.

444
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,760
然后他就搬去了纽约
He moved to New York soon after.

445
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,880
你注意到什么
What do you notice? 

446
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
这是同一个人吗
That the same guy both times?

447
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,240
-怎么这么问  -挺像
- Why do you ask? - That's a close match.

448
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,500
但锁门的人是左撇子
But the guy locking up is left-handed,

449
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,880
开门的人用右手
and the guy unlocking is a righty.

450
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,910
而且他高一点
He's also a couple inches taller.

451
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,720
-正是  -你在查什么
- Exactly. - What are you looking at here?

452
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,430
-高明抢劫案吗  -比那糟多了
-Some kind of elaborate robbery? - Something much worse.

453
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,090
我确定一下
So let me get this straight.

454
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,650
你想让我约谈
You want me to conduct a series of interviews

455
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,490
在局里的每一个人  还要这个人帮忙
with everyone on the station and you want this guy to help?

456
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,000
他是唯一一个在桥被淹后登岛的
He's the only one who arrived on this island after the bridge went out.

457
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,940
我知道他样子有点怪
I know he appears a little strange,

458
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,090
但他的包里确实装着有趣的装备
but he does have some interesting equipment in those bags.

459
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,270
好吧  除非他有指纹扫描仪
Yeah, well, unless he has a fingerprint scanner

460
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,500
以及暴力犯罪数据库
and the VICAP database,

461
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,250
否则他有什么是我们需要的
what does he have that we need?

462
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,420
费伊特工  对吗
Agent...Fahey, is it?

463
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,380
你了解地震仪吗
Are you familiar with the instantel seismograph?

464
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,210
防弹衣
Body armor?

465
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,600
我觉得我们似乎不必如此重装
I don't think we'll be taking too much heavy fire with this group.

466
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,860
詹宁斯  我朝九晚五大部分时间
Look, Jennings, I spend most of my nine-to-five

467
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,960
都坐在办公桌前
tethered to a desk.

468
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,880
我审讯过一些贪污和盗窃身份的窃贼
I've questioned a few embezzlers and some identity thieves.

469
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,740
但这次我们是要跟杀人犯共处一室
We're about to walk into a room with a killer.

470
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,290
那我躲在你身后
And I'll be standing right behind you.

471
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,220
谢谢  爱米斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Amis.

472
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,650
我是联调局的  正在岛上调查一单失踪人口案
I'm with the FBI, looking for a missing person on the island here.

473
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,760
我要问你些常规问题
I'd like to ask you a standard series of questions,

474
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,510
非常感谢您的配合
and I'd appreciate your cooperation.

475
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,670
-好  问吧  -这是杰克・洛林斯
- Okay, so ask. - This is Jack Rollins.

476
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,880
我想知道
I'm trying to establish

477
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,100
这个岛上谁最近和他联系过
who had contact with him on the island recently.

478
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,400
我不认识他
I don't recognize him.

479
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,660
每年的这个时候都没太多游客
We don't get too many tourists this time of the year,

480
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,990
但有的话我会在店里碰见
but I would have seen him at the store.

481
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,340
今晚在局里的几位你认识谁  贝姬
Who do you recognize at the station tonight, Becky?

482
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,650
我认识斯坦利很久了
I've known Stanley most of my life.

483
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,730
-你不认识谁  -度蜜月的那对
- Who don't you recognize? - That honeymoon couple for one.

484
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,720
你们两个在哪里认识的
And where did you two meet?

485
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,940
奥尔巴尼
We met in Albany.

486
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,400
你早前为何没疏散
Why didn't you evacuate earlier?

487
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,000
我说过了
I told you,

488
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,410
那一渔网能值几万块呢
I've got a few thousand bucks crawling around in those traps

489
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,130
你们非逼我扔码头上了
you made me leave down on the docks.

490
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,200
所以你就无视紧急状态通知
So you disregarded a state of emergency?

491
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,850
我得保住我的收成
I had to preserve my catch.

492
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,090
你经常一个人放网吗
You often pull in traps all by yourself?

493
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,030
-进展如何  -还行
- How's it going? - Good.

494
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,860
看到这些小波动了吗
See all these tiny waves?

495
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,470
这叫微震
They're called microseisms,

496
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,270
这些小起伏是心跳
and all these little bumps are the heartbeat.

497
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,240
这根针像感应地壳变动一样的感应心跳
The needle picks it up like it would a tectonic shift,

498
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,340
这里感应很多
and it's picking up a lot.

499
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,310
-其他人呢  -都没问题
- And everyone else? - I'm getting clean readings.

500
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,450
里面的金属会放大信号
The metal in the table amplifies it.

501
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,890
每个人都很平静
Everyone is steady.

502
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,330
酒吧老板斯坦利稍差一点
Stanley the bar owner is a little below average,

503
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,020
不过我想他应该有别的问题
but I think there might be something wrong with him.

504
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,370
没事  我想他血液的酒精浓度
No, I just think his blood alcohol level

505
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,610
都能发动割草机了
could start a lawn mower.

506
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,670
-不过那个渔夫呢  -他在紧张
- But that fisherman in there? - He's nervous about something.

507
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,880
我认识伊森・马特森
I know Ethan Mattson.

508
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,160
他在欧文住了五年了
He's lived on Owen for five years.

509
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,470
虽然他有点小麻烦  但他精通船务
He gets into some trouble, but he's good on the boats.

510
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,930
你想知道我不认识谁吗
Do you wanna know who I don't recognize?

511
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,120
欧文岛上一半的人知道坎宁汉地产
Half of Owen knows Cunningham Properties,

512
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,670
但我从来没跟他面对面打过招呼
but I can't say I've ever said "Hi" to his face.

513
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,610
还有那个流浪汉
And that drifter?

514
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,330
谁会大冬天到岛上来
I mean, who comes to an island in winter

515
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,030
找季节工作
looking for seasonal work?

516
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,360
温特女士  请问您做斯坦福大学
Ms. Winter, how long have you been the dean

517
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,050
学生事务处主任多久了
of student affairs at Stanford?

518
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,000
十  不  十一年了
10--no, 11 years.

519
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,900
我想您帮忙
I'm wondering if you could shed light

520
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,960
一件前学生失踪案
on a former student who went missing.

521
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,540
昂利・缪塞  他毕业于
Henri Musset? He graduated--

522
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,410
2005年  我记得昂利  他是留学生
In 2005. I remember Henri. He was an international student.

523
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,450
毕业后立刻就失踪了
He went missing right after he graduated.

524
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,180
警方寻找了数周
Police called for weeks.

525
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,350
法国派出了特派员  国际刑警都参与了
Inspectors from France, even Interpol.

526
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,020
那孩子在圣地亚哥有一条网络踪迹
There was a digital trail on the boy in San Diego,

527
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,490
在他毕业18个月后
18 months after graduating.

528
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,280
我们和警方也是这么说的
Just as we told the authorities then,

529
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,030
昂利从没留下过转寄地址
Henri never left a forwarding address.

530
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,890
我们经常会和毕业校友暂时失去联系
We often lose touch with recent alumni

531
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,250
直到他们安顿下来
until they settle down somewhere.

532
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,050
这么说最后一次见到昂利还是在校园里
So the last time Henri was seen was on campus.

533
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,780
他住学生公寓  当时有室友吗
He lived in student housing. Did he have a roommate?

534
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,120
有  最后一年的室友是名学生  叫亚历克斯・德克兰
Yes. His last year, it was a student named Alex Declan.

535
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,390
这上面说
It says here--huh.

536
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,790
怎么了
What?

537
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,230
我刚在昂利的住宿表格里看到条记录
I just see a note on Henri's housing form.

538
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,850
他在最后一个学期要求调换室友
He requested a new roommate his last semester.

539
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,960
最后一年的最后一个学期
The last semester of his senior year?

540
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,430
-这种事情常见吗  -不太常见
- Does that happen often? - Not usually.

541
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,700
大多数毕业生满脑子是其他很多事情
Most seniors have a million other things on their mind.

542
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,340
不过问题貌似解决了
But the matter seems to have been resolved.

543
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,580
你有德克兰的记录吗
Do you have any records on Declan?

544
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,860
奇怪
That's strange.

545
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,920
德克兰在住宿记录里是昂利的室友
Declan is listed in housing as Henri's roommate,

546
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,220
但我找不到他的入学登记
but I can't find his registration.

547
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,550
照片也没有
No student photo either.

548
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,150
肯定是什么地方弄错了
Something must have fallen through the cracks.

549
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,170
丹尼斯  你真是个大忙人
Dennis, you're such a busy guy.

550
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,980
都不怎么来岛上
You don't get out to the island very often.

551
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
我用不着天天守着地产
I don't babysit my properties.

552
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,460
不过酒店的进度晚了几天
But the hotel out here was days behind schedule.

553
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,420
你觉得我愿意大雨天逛沙坑吗
You think I want to slog around this sandpit in the rain?

554
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,030
维克托  你没有身份证明
Victor, you don't have an ID.

555
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,120
你没有任何来岛上的正当理由
You don't have a solid alibi for being here on the island

556
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,980
也没有去码头的正当理由
and, last of all, for being down at the boatyard.

557
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,300
我说过了  我只是路过而已
I told you. I was passing through.

558
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,430
认得这个吗  是你的东西
Recognize this? It's yours.

559
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,930
有很多的D型环
You've got a lot of D-rings.

560
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,330
有点奇怪
Kind of weird.

561
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,290
你要么是个登山者  要么
Unless you're a climber, or...

562
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,670
当过军人
in the military.

563
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,700
你心脏有问题吗
Do you have a heart problem?

564
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,370
因为现在  你的心脏在狂跳
Because right now, yours is really pumping.

565
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,160
欧文岛警局  我是乔丝・卡特警探

566

卡特警探

572
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,360
来自纽约市警局

我有消息
I have new information

574
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,890

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,340
我需要立刻和他通话
I need to speak to him immediately.

576
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,490

Who is it?

577

有个市里的警探呼叫
Some detective from the city got through,

578
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,400
说她叫什么卡朋特  卡特

579
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,470
发电机

能听到吗  完毕

上帝啊  她  她死了吗
Oh, my God. Is she--is she dead?

582
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,690
你不应该出去  风暴很强
You shouldn't go out there. The storm's pretty bad.

583
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,260
我在跟踪一条线索  很急
I'm following up on a lead, it's urgent.

584
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,340
我得去欧文岛

585
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,130
我不能让你去
I can't let you do that.

586
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,160
我不管有什么线索
I don't care what lead it is. 

587
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,500

先是审问我们  现在又这样
First you question us, and now this?

592

你  你也在帮他们
You. You were helping them.

593
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,800
他们到底在干什么
What were they doing in there, really?

594
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,680
他们征用了我的设备

596
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,840
说是要找到一个杀人犯
Talking about finding a killer.

597
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,280
贝基  他们问了你什么
Becky, what did they ask you?

598
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,350
他们问我认识这里的谁
They asked me who I recognized here.

599
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,630
那你不认识谁啊
Then who don't you recognized.

600
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,800
大家请冷静
Everyone please settle down.

601
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,990
你正在岛的另一端建酒店
You're building a hotel on the other side of the island.

602
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,380
却没人认识你
Nobody even knows your face.

603
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,230
我在市里有几百个商业伙伴
I have hundreds of business contacts in the city.

604
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,180
随便打个电话
Call any of them.

605
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,420
那么做有什么好处  哈罗德
And what good did that do, Harold?

606
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,720
行为分析  约翰  给点时间
Behavior analysis, John. Just give it a minute.

607
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,920
你呢  新郎先生  谁都不认识你
What about you, Mr. Newlywed? Nobody knows your face.

608
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,360
等等  我认识她
Wait a second, I know his face.

609
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,680
各位  咱们都忘了  她是被刀杀死的
Everybody, we're forgetting, she was killed with a knife.

610
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,790
-是谁的刀  -我知道是谁的
- So whose knife was it? - I know whose it is.

611
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,430
那是一把卡巴刀[兰博刀]
That knife? It's called a Ka-Bar.

612
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,540
在普通装具店是买不到的
Not exactly something you pick up at a local bait and tackle.

613
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,930
我没伤人
I didn't hurt anybody.

614
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,140
一般人不会
You need to be a special kind of person

615
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,900
携带那种武器
to carry a weapon like that.

616
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,990
放开我
Let me go.

617
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,170
如我所料
That's what I thought.

618
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,470
我是说谎了
I was lying.

619
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,300
行了吧
Okay?

620
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,250
上帝作证  我是说谎了  但我不是杀人犯
God help me, I was lying. But I'm not a killer.

621
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,470
没错  你是海军陆战队的
No. You're a marine.

622
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,930
那把刀  这纹身
The knife. The tattoo.

623
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,750
还有你包上挂的D型环
The D-rings clipped to your bag.

624
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,300
你是逃兵
You're on the run.

625
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,940
基地勒强营24期的
24th meu out of Camp Lejeune.

626
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,070
第二期兵役了
Second tour.

627
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,490
我不能回去
I couldn't go back.

628
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,860
我本想找船去加拿大
I wanted to get a boat to Canada.

629
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,910
结果被困在这儿了
I got stuck here.

630
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,940
谁还知道你有那把刀
So who else knew you had that knife?

631
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,370
我不知道
I don't know.

632
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,950
我是跟那个渔夫一起过来的
I mean, I came into the station with the fisherman.

633
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,470
等等  那个渔夫去哪儿了
Wait, where is the fisherman?

634
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,530
-他肯定是溜掉了  -我去追
- He must have slipped out. - I'll go after him.

635
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,840
如果我没回来  带这些人去安全地带
If I don't come back, get these people to safety.

636
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,550
你觉得我们跨州之前
So...do you think we can cross the entire state

637
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,340
你能说句话吗
before you say a word to me?

638
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,010
你想说什么
What do you want to talk about?

639
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,030
我能想到个话题
I can think of some things.

640
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,370
比如说一名纽约警探无法进入联调局
Like how an NYPD detective got aced out of the FBI

641
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,890
就因为择友不当  这话题怎么样
because she keeps bad company, how about that?

642
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,710
你在说什么  联调局
What are you talking about, the FBI?

643
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,460
跟内务部不太友好吧  卡尔
Not a friend of internal affairs, huh, Cal?

644
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,370
乔丝  我在缉毒队
Joss, I'm in narcotics.

645
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,240
每年我们都会被内务部查好几次
We get pulled in by IAB half-a-dozen times a year.

646
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,770
对我们来说不算什么
My neck of the woods don't mean a thing.

647
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,080
对我算
It does to me.

648
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,780
让我怀疑我是不是信任错了人
Makes me wonder about the man I trusted.

649
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,200
怎么  你不相信我吗
Oh, what, you don't trust me?

650
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,810
你觉得我腐败了  我受贿了吗
You think I'm dirty? That I'm on the take?

651
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,510
你是不是这么想的
Is that what you think?

652
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,560
我不知道该怎么想  卡尔
I don't know what to think, Cal.

653
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,450
他们到底跟你说了我什么
Yo, what did they tell you about me?

654
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,090
比彻  慢点
Beecher! Slow down!

655
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,370
真的吗
You serious?

656
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,620
怎么  你以为我会伤害你
What, you think I'd hurt you?

657
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,340
我不知道
I don't know.

658
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,180
可我不想伤害你
But I don't want to hurt you.

659
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,960
大麻
Marijuana.

660
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,510
这就是你想从风暴中拯救的东西
This is what you were trying to protect from the storm.

661
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,590
不  这不可能
Oh, no, that couldn't be.

662
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,530
难以置信
Unbelievable.

663
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,220
我们要找杀人犯
We're hunting a killer,

664
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,430
结果却跟这么个业余毒贩杠上了
and instead we get amateur drug night in the sticks.

665
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,900
你用你的船偷运这些东西吗
You smuggle it in on your boat?

666
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,400
别回答了  我要说对了你流点血就行
Ah, don't say anything. Just bleed if I'm right.

667
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,660
一般说来  我会把你送进监狱
Ordinarily, I'd make sure you went behind bars.

668
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,900
但我眼下另有要事
But I got bigger fish to fry.

669
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,940
先把你送进后备箱吧
So you go in the trunk.

670
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,880
联调局
FBI.

671
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,810
我哪里暴露了
What gave me away?

672
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,750
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

673
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,900
约谈间隔时的感应针孔
The needle spiked in between the interviews.

674
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,040
当时我没注意看
When I wasn't watching.

675
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,220
当时你在桌边休息
When you were resting on the table.

676
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,460
你应该注意下心率的
You should keep an eye on that heart rate.

677
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,220
我就知道你的水平远不止那种审问
I knew you were too good at those interrogations.

678
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,550
你到底是谁
Who are you really?

679
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,120
我也想问你一样的问题
I could ask you the same thing.

680
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,340
你比我预想的还要高一点
You're taller than I would have thought.

681
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,310
还剪了头发
And you cut your hair.

682
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,500
你完全相信了敬业的"费伊特工"
And you bought every minute of the dedicated "Agent Fahey".

683
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,160
是啊  演得挺好
Yes, quite the performance.

684
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,200
敢出声  我就开杀戒了
Make a sound, I start hurting innocents.

685
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,120
我们走走吧
Let's take a walk.

686
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,890
我想私密点的空间对我们俩都好
I thought a bit more privacy would do us some good.

687
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,320
事已至此
You know, the walls are closing in.

688
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,660
你无处可逃
You have no place to run.

689
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,860
结束了
It's over.

690
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,390
对费伊来说结束了  当然
It's over for Fahey, sure.

691
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,310
就像洛林斯来说结束了
Just like it was over for rollins.

692
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,830
你是在他们死前还是死后拔了牙
Was that before or after you tore teeth out of his head

693
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,420
扔进火炉的
and threw them in a furnace?

694
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,800
那倒霉东西烧不尽  有漏洞  我知道
Damn things never burn. Sloppy, I know.

695
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,960
但是联调局来敲门了
But when the FBI's knocking on your door,

696
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,990
动作要快一点才行
you have to move faster than you should.

697
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,080
会有其他特工来调查的
Other agents will come looking.

698
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,340
就像上一个那样吗
Like the last one?

699
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,110
联调局特工总是两人一起行动
Federal agents always work in pairs.

700
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,210
但是那个穿着愚蠢蓝色风衣的家伙单干了
But this hard-ass showed up solo in a stupid blue windbreaker,

701
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,350
敲我的门  问洛林斯的下落
knocking on my door, looking for Rollins.

702
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,700
他跟我说话
He talked to me.

703
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,410
看起来很紧张
Seemed nervous.

704
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,500
有点不太自在
A little out of his element.

705
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,910
然后我把他敲晕了
Right then I knew I had him beat.

706
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,990
我别无选择  只好杀了他
He left me no choice. I had to kill him.

707
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,100
然后我意识到离开这个岛唯一的办法
Then I realized my only way off this island

708
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,030
就是变成他
was to become him.

709
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,320
结果又遇到这场该死的风暴  
Then this damn storm hits, 

710
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,120
还有个法警牛仔来敲门
and some cowboy US Marshal comes knocking.

711
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,650
我只能继续扮演费伊特工
I was stuck as Special Agent Fahey,

712
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,370
就即兴发挥了
so I improvised.

713
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,370
还有那个副警长  为什么要伤害她
And the deputy. Why harm her?

714
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,220
我不确定她都从无线电里听到什么
Well, I couldn't be sure what she heard off the radio.

715
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,520
得时刻做好即兴发挥的准备啊
You always have to be ready to improvise.

716
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,760
说实话  问题不在于我是谁
Honestly, the question isn't who I am.

717
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,030
而是你是谁
It's who you are.

718
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,100
我观察了你一整晚
I watched you all night.

719
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,920
你看  我总能认出伪装者
See, I can always spot an impostor.

720
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,790
我认出了你
I spotted you.

721
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,440
你和我一样吗
Are you like me?

722
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,410
你根本不了解
You have no idea.

723
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,520
你不过是业余的
You're an amateur at this.

724
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,180
我可没打算这样
Not the way I planned it, man.

725
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,300
我不伤害人
I don't hurt people.

726
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,400
后备箱里的联调局探员也不是我杀的
And I didn't kill the FBI guy in that trunk.

727
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,620
但是你碍着事了  所以你得沉到海里
But you're in the way, so you go in the drink.

728
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,140
别担心
Don't worry.

729
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,500
水这么凉  很快的
As cold as this water is, it'll be quick.

730
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,980
伊森
Hey, Ethan.

731
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,020
有这么快吗
As quick as that?

732
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,330
费伊是扮不长了  我认为神秘的格尔先生
Now that Fahey won't get far, I think the mysterious Mr. Gull

733
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,200
可以成为下一个挑战
might be my next great challenge.

734
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,320
你永远无法离开这个岛
You'll never get off the island.

735
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,070
明早他们会赶来寻找真正的阿兰・费伊
By morning they'll come here looking for the real Alan Fahey.

736
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,340
他们会找到他
And they'll find him...

737
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,120
在他的后备箱里
in the trunk of his car.

738
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,590
那你呢
And what about you?

739
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,410
那你呢
And what about you?

740
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,710
那你呢
And what about you?

741
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,620
那  你呢
And what about...you?

742
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,740
你问的问题  就是答案
You asked the question and you're the answer.

743
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,840
你的飞机
Your plane.

744
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,370
你要带我飞离这里
You're gonna fly me out of here.

745
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,450
你的命还有用
You haven't outlived your usefulness.

746
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:50,600
你成不了我  因为我拯救生命
You could never be me because I save lives.

747
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,940
而你夺取生命
You take them.

748
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,820
不  我比那些人活得都要优质
No, I live those lives better than real people ever could.

749
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,590
我跟着他们  看他们挥霍自己拥有的一切
I follow them and watch them waste what they have.

750
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,550
我给予他们的身份以公平
I do those identities justice.

751
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,820
见我所见
The things I've seen.

752
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,940
活我所活
The lives I've lived.

753
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,190
等我找到我想成为的那个人  我会停手
One day I'll stop, when I find the person I'm meant to be.

754
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,460
什么
What?

755
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,310
像你这样的人无法停手
People like you don't stop.

756
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,090
你想怎么找借口都随你
You can rationalize it however you like.

757
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,360
但你伤害他人只因为你喜欢
But you hurt people because you like it.

758
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,170
只因为你变态
Because you're sick!

759
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,870
你心理失衡  你需要治疗
You're maladjusted and you need help.

760
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,790
再想想
On second thought, 

761
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,400
我觉得还是换个方式离开这个岛
maybe I'll find another way off this island.

762
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,380
真遗憾不能进一步了解你
I'll miss finding out more about you.

763
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,610
还有什么没说的
If there's anything left to tell,

764
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,230
我继续生活时随便编下吧
I'll make it up as I go along.

765
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,870
别担心  我很擅长
Don't worry, I'm good at that.

766
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,960
就像你一样
Just like you.

767
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,410
-你没事吧  哈罗德  -警探
- You all right, Harold? - Detective?

768
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,570
你真是太及时了
You have impeccable timing.

769
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,690
你怎么过来的
How did you get here?

770
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,170
跟着海岸警卫队来了
I hitched a ride with the Coast Guard.

771
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,940
屋里面一些情绪激动的人说
And some very unpleasant people inside said they thought

772
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,460
他们看见你朝这边来了
they saw you come this way.

773
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,850
就是他吗  那位身份杀手
So is that him, our identity killer?

774
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,220
他扮成了联调局特工
He was pretending to be an FBI agent.

775
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,390
他是真的很擅长
He was really rather good at it.

776
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,410
他有警徽  配枪  还有
He had a badge and a gun and a--

777
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,440
还有什么
And what?

778
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,690
防弹衣
Body armor.

779
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,800
{\pos(193,200)}欧文岛

780
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,510
{\pos(193,200)}欧文岛

781
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,740
你在干什么
What are you doing?

782
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,250
这里是警局
It's a police station.

783
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,130
肯定会有这玩意儿
There's bound to be one of these around here somewhere.

784
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,630
听着
Hey, listen...

785
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,690
我不知道昨晚我们算怎么回事
I don't know what happened last night between us,

786
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,670
但是  我想知道今天怎么回事
but, uh, I'm wondering what happens today.

787
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,490
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what happens.

788
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,080
但是我很高兴有你在
But I'm glad you were here.

789
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,320
昨晚有毒贩用捕鱼枪射我
A drug smuggler shot at me with a spear gun last night.

790
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,800
你是第一次遇到吗
Is that a first for you?

791
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,320
真希望是第一次
Wish I could say yes.

792
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,940
很高兴你回来了  里瑟先生
Glad you made it back, Mr. Reese.

793
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,490
我也是
I am too.

794
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,320
很高兴机器是对的
And I'm glad the machine was right.

795
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,900
怎么说
How so?

796
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,250
它很聪明  告诉我们凶手
It was smart enough to tell us about a killer

797
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,830
有着多重身份
with multiple identities.

798
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,400
也许出现六个号码不是故障
It may be true that the six numbers were not a glitch,

799
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,200
但之前三天的沉默是
but the three days of silence preceding it were.

800
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,540
如果机器正常运行
If the machine had been working properly,

801
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,970
我们也许就能拿到阿兰・费伊的号码
we might have gotten a number for the real Alan Fahey

802
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,180
然后救下他
and saved him.

803
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,490
而现在  却牺牲了一名联调局特工
Instead, an FBI agent is dead.

804
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,430
真希望知道这对未来意味着什么
But I wish I knew what that means for the future.

805
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,450
至少风暴过去了
At least the storm is passing.

806
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,610
不  里瑟先生  我感觉刚刚开始
No, Mr. Reese, I have a feeling that it's just beginning.
