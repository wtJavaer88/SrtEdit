1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,030
你被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,070
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,920
一台机器  机器
A machine-- machine.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,590
机器
Machine.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,380
你被监
You are being wa--

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,050
我破解了病毒代码
I was able to crack the virus' code

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,210
发现了一个名字  德西玛科技
and learn the name-- Decima Technologies.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,720
我相信他们制造病毒
I believe they created the virus

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,220
是为了感染唯一的目标  机器
to infect a single target-- the machine.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,100
因为和中情局不一样
Unlike the CIA,

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,080
我的雇主隐约知道要发生什么了
my employers have an inkling of what happens next.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,130
我只是认为需要一个紧急开关以防万一
I just thought it needed an off switch just in case.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,160
我之前提过的那场风暴
That storm on the horizon that I mentioned,

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,540
恐怕已经到来了
I'm afraid it's arrived.

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,280
恐怖分子企图炸机

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,730
有新消息吗  芬奇
You got an update for me yet, Finch?

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,210
这句话都变成你打听进度的口头禅了  里瑟先生
This is becoming your version of "Are we there yet", Mr. Reese,

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,220
没  我们没有
and no, we are not.

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,290
我们已经十天没接到新号码了
It's been ten days since we got a new number.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,070
我在尽快赶了
I'm working as quickly as I can.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,600
再快点儿吧
Well, work faster.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,590
我可不想知道
I don't wanna find out

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,450
倒计时归零后会如何  你呢
what happens when that clock hits zero, do you?

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,930
不太想
Not particularly.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
你说我们以后还能收到号码么
Can you tell me if we're ever gonna get another number,

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,850
还是说病毒已经永久性毁掉了你的机器
or has that virus destroyed your machine for good?

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
我相信机器仍在活动中
I believe that the machine is still active,

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,490
只是无法联系我们
it's just unable to make contact.

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,170
要是我们知道它在哪里  也许可以
If we knew where it was, maybe we could just...

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,460
拔掉插头  重插一下
unplug it and then plug it back in.

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,650
天真烂漫向来非我所长
Simplicity was never my strong suit.

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,520
我还是不明白监听纽约警察
It's still not clear to me how stalking the NYPD

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,770
如何能帮我们改善此一窘境
helps either of us at this unfortunate time.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,910
就算我无法在出事前赶到
If I can't get there before something bad happens,

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,500
至少要在出事时赶到
I can at least get there the second it does.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,400
全体人员  呼叫调度
All units, 10-3.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,520
东五十四和列克星敦交界处  请响应
East 54th and Lexington. Please respond.

38
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,160
你终于扔掉你搭档了
You finally ditch your partner?

39
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,510
弗斯科到上城区办案了
Fusco's uptown working a case.

40
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,060
三角恋玩崩了
Love triangle gone bad.

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,980
-有玩好的时候吗  -想也没有
- Do any of those ever go good? - Can't imagine they do.

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,950
怎么回事
What happened here?

43
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,550
死者两名是以利亚的人
Two of the bodies belong to Elias.

44
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,210
-还有名无辜路人  -是俄罗斯人干的吗
- The other's an innocent. - Think it's the Russians?

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,510
有可能
It's possible.

46
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,280
不过以利亚得罪过一堆人
But Elias has pissed off so many people.

47
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,530
卡特  我听人说
Listen, Carter, I've been hearing from people

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,770
你一直在调查比彻的谋杀案
that you've been looking into Beecher's murder.

49
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,510
我下班做什么事与你无关  铁尼
What I do in my off time isn't your concern, Terney.

50
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,790
不不  我可不是想找你麻烦
No, no. I'm not looking to bust your balls.

51
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,460
我只想你知道  如果你需要
I just want you to know, if you need help,

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,500
我非常乐意帮忙
I'm more than happy to give you a hand.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,620
谢了  我去那边转转
Thanks. You know, I'm gonna canvass up the block,

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,470
看有没有人开口
see if I can get anybody to talk.

55
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,860
你还好吗  卡特
You okay, Carter?

56
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,240
你看呢  约翰
How do I look, John?

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,210
比彻被杀案有新线索吗
You get anything new on Beecher's killer?

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,420
没有
Nothing.

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,290
不过我知道跟HR有关
But I know HR had their hands in it,

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,850
我会不惜一切扳倒他们
I'm gonna do whatever I can to bring them down.

61
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,650
我很遗憾  卡特
I'm sorry, Carter.

62
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,220
比彻是个好人
Beecher was a good man.

63
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,950
是的
Yes. He was.

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,370
不过我还有活儿要干
But I got a job to do.

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,090
三具尸体  两周来第八起谋杀了
Three fresh bodies-- my eighth homicide in two weeks.

66
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,060
需要我做什么开口就行
Just tell me what I can do to help.

67
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,690
先告诉我怎么回事
You can start by telling me what's changed.

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
这些谋杀大都是有预谋的
Most of these homicides were premeditated.

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,370
这种你们一般都会提前警示我们
The type of situations you guys usually warn us about.

70
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,330
出了点事  我们正在解决
There's a situation. We're working on it.

71
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,230
快点吧
Well, hurry.

72
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,110
真没想过我会说这话  不过
I never thought I'd say this, but...

73
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,340
俄罗斯人比以利亚还坏
the Russians are worse than Elias--

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,380
人多势众  不讲规矩
More manpower, fewer rules.

75
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,800
是啊  差点酿成灾难
Yes, it was almost catastrophic.

76
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,610
恐怖分子企图炸机

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,340
幸好  放炸弹的人是外行
Luckily, the bomber was an amateur,

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,710
所以没能成功
so it failed to go off.

79
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,890
那是因为我们整整一周没接到过任何号码
That's because we haven't received any numbers in over a week.

80
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,550
对组织的威胁
The threat to the program

81
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,450
比我们想像得要严重
is much greater than we thought.

82
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,840
稍等
Hang on.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,030
我们的技术人员终于破解了
Our techs were finally able to decode the chip

84
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,650
艾丽西娅・考文尸体上发现的芯片
we recovered from Alicia Corwin's body.

85
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,130
我们发现病毒跟一家
We've connected the virus to a group

86
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,180
名叫德西玛科技的组织有关
called Decima Technologies.

87
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,610
这是上海的一家私人情报机构
Private intelligence outfit working out of Shanghai.

88
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,130
考文认为有人向他们泄露了
Corwin believes someone leaked them a portion

89
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,830
北极光的部分源代码
of the Northern Lights source code...

90
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,410
装在一台手提电脑中
on a laptop.

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,890
我们认为德西玛企图摧毁组织
We think Decima is trying to destroy the program.

92
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,810
我等你的指令
I'll wait for your instructions.

93
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,410
我现在不需要什么  梅女士
I won't be needing anything else, Ms. May...

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,090
别打扰我就行
other than some privacy.

95
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,240
但我有所需要  先生
But there are a few things I need, Sir.

96
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,770
您得明白  我早晚会辞职
You had to know I'd quit eventually.

97
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,510
这工作没前途啊
This is kind of a dead-end job.

98
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,080
你们连养老保险都不给
I mean, you guys don't even offer a 401K.

99
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,320
你要什么  梅女士
What do you want, Ms. May?

100
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,510
信息
Information.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,540
要小心回答我的问题噢
And be very careful how you answer my questions.

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,350
优秀的助理能分辨出上司是否撒谎
A good assistant always knows when her boss is lying.

103
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,870
你怎么了
What's happening to you?

104
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,530
有号码了
We got one?

105
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,550
机器被塞进了大量的虚假数据
The machine is being buried under an avalanche of false data,

106
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,470
但不知怎么
but somehow...

107
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,870
居然给出了他的号码
it was able to get us his number.

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,750
他是谁
So who is he?

109
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,630
厄尼斯特・唐希尔 
Ernest Thornhill.

110
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,210
一家数据输入公司的首席执行官
CEO of a data entry company.

111
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,640
最近买下了纽约州几家公用电话公司
Recently bought several payphone companies in New York State.

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,100
其净资产超过两千万美元
His net worth is just over 20 million.

113
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,730
有嫌犯或者不满的亲戚吗
Any suspects or angry family members?

114
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,340
唐希尔先生非常小心谨慎
Mr. Thornhill is a very careful man.

115
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,120
想黑进他公司的数据库颇有难度
It's been a challenge hacking into his company's database.

116
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,590
他使用独有的长达十位
He's using unique, ten-digit codes

117
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,590
且无重复的字母数字字符当密码
with non-repeating alphanumeric characters as passwords.

118
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,430
我能破解  但颇费时间
I can break them, but it'd take time.

119
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,150
不如我们亲自拜访一下唐希尔先生吧
Why don't we just pay Mr. Thornhill a visit in person?

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,610
那就开工吧
Let's go to work.

121
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,270
我去破解防火墙
I'll try to get through the firewall.

122
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,710
我也一样
I will too.

123
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,780
-你好  -你好  需要帮忙吗
- Hello. - Hi. May I help you?

124
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,150
是的  我是约翰・鲁尼
Yes, I'm John Rooney.

125
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,240
我和唐希尔先生约好了见面
I have an appointment with Mr. Thornhill.

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,030
唐希尔先生今天没有会面预约
I don't have any appointment scheduled today for Mr. Thornhill.

127
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,780
他去旅行了
He's traveling.

128
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,990
看来是沟通出了点问题
Guess we had a miscommunication.

129
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,700
他大概什么时候回来
When do you think he'll be back?

130
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,080
抱歉  您叫什么来着
I'm sorry. Your name again was?

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,740
我给他发邮件吧
I'll just send him an email.

132
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,880
里瑟先生  这个公司有点奇怪
Mr. Reese, there's something strange about this company.

133
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,550
这些数据输入员
These data entry assistants,

134
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,940
他们在把打印出来的内容重新敲进电脑
they're typing in computer code off dot matrix printouts.

135
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,620
这毫无道理啊
It doesn't make any sense.

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,240
他们在修改吧
They're modifying it?

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,040
没有  看来是当天从一台电脑上获取数据
No. They seem to be taking data from one computer on one day

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,850
第二天再把这些数据敲进另一台电脑里
and typing it into another one on the next.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,680
似乎毫无意义
Seems almost pointless.

140
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,300
或许这家公司是在为别的业务打掩护
Maybe this company's a front for something else.

141
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,630
不太合法的业务
Something less legal.

142
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,410
{\pos(142,111)}未知来电

143
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,600
喂
Yes?

144
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,700
你都干了什么  哈罗德
What did you do to it, Harold?

145
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,310
没时间忸怩作态了
There's no time to be coy.

146
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,780
我们都知道  机器被攻击了
We both know the machine's under attack.

147
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,300
我不明白
What I don't understand is

148
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,090
为什么一个有自动修复功能的强大系统  
why a robust system with self-annealing properties

149
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,890
却不能抵御一个简单的病毒
isn't defending itself against a simple virus.

150
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,690
是你在伤害它吗  哈罗德
Did you injure it, Harold?

151
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,100
所以它才不能反抗吗
Is that why it can't fight back?

但他的能力这次排不上用场

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,910
你不认为她会愿意当"鸵鸟夫人"吗
You don't think she will consent to be Mrs. Ostrich?

196

我们现在肯定挣了不少钱

We did our part, and now we've moved on, haven't we?

你还记得你的真名是什么吗  哈罗德
Do you even remember your real name, Harold?

我还没向她求婚呢
I haven't actually asked her yet,

217
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,280
所以严格说来  只能算是"零日"

A NOC sets up a business, residence, a whole life.

302
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,040
然后行动取消了
Then the operation gets scrapped.

303
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,040
没人去清理原先的假身份
No one cleans up the fake ID,

304
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,420
最后害得人追着个空车满城跑
and you wind up chasing empty town cars around the city.

305
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,540
有点意思  我倒另有看法
Interesting theory. I have a different one.

306
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,940
我很奇怪为什么只能找到一张唐希尔先生的照片
I was curious why I could only find one photo of Mr. Thornhill,

307
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,360
所以就研究了
so I did some investigating,

308
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,760
我们现有的这张照片
inside the photo that we already have,

309
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,090
我发现了
and I uncovered

310
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,280
一个很奇怪的现象
some peculiar information within the file.

311
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,430
看
Look at this.

312
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,840
是张合成照
It's a composite.

313
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,470
看来唐希尔确实是假身份
So Thornhill's definitely a fake.

314
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,250
差不多
Of a sort.

315
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,380
我黑进了唐希尔先生的手机账单
I accessed Mr. Thornhill's cell phone records,

316
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,860
根据GPS数据
and according to the GPS data,

317
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,230
两天前他出现在哥伦布圆环广场附近
he was near Columbus Circle two days ago.

318
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,010
他就在这个位置发了一封电子邮件
He sent an email from that exact location

320
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,230
下午4点32分时
at 4:32 PM.

321
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,680
根本没人
And no one's there?

322
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,680
有人篡改了数据
Someone spoofed the data.

323
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,740
这种运算  相当复杂
An algorithm. Complicated one.

324
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,050
是我的作品
It's one of mine.

325
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,700
我只在一个永远不可能被复制的地方用过它
I used it in the one place where it could never be duplicated--

326
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,620
在机器上
in the machine.

327
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,090
厄尼斯特・唐希尔不是间谍
Ernest Thornhill is not a spy,

328
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,030
不过你说得对  他并不存在
but you're right about the fact that he doesn't exist.

329
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,520
他是生存本能激发的产物
He's a product of a survival instinct.

330
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,320
厄尼斯特・唐希尔
Ernest Thornhill...

331
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,890
就是机器
is the machine.

332
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,660
好了  过来看
Okay, come look.

333
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,720
-我看上去  -印象深刻吗
- I look so-- - Impressionistic?

334
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,220
从容自如
Leisurely.

335
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,190
把手机给我
Give me your phone.

336
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,130
我们去个隐蔽点的地方
Let's go somewhere more private.

337
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,480
离病毒倒计时归零只有不到六个小时了
We've got less than six hours till this virus hits zero.

338
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,160
我知道这时间  里瑟先生
I'm aware of the time, Mr. Reese.

339
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,480
为什么机器要创造厄尼斯特・唐希尔这个人物
So why did the machine create Ernest Thornhill?

340
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,450
不知道
I have no idea.

341
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,350
我编程让它观察真人
I programmed it to watch real people,

342
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,770
而不是创造虚拟人物
not to fabricate virtual ones.

343
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,740
看来你的机器颇有创造力  芬奇
It looks like your machine got real creative, Finch.

344
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,500
这不可能
That's impossible.

345
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,730
我采取了某种  预防措施来避免了
I took certain...precautions to make sure of that.

346
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,800
有没有预防措施  机器都造出了唐希尔
Precautions or no, the machine made Thornhill.

347
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,580
德西玛想要他的命  我们得知道为什么
Decima wants him dead, and we need to know why.

348
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
唐希尔在城里四处买公用电话公司
Thornhill's been buying up pay phones all over the city.

349
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,100
为什么
Why?

350
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,450
为什么你的机器需要一间公寓
And why does your machine need an apartment,

351
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,550
一部电话  一架从机场开回来的车
a phone, a car from the airport?

352
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,190
因为拥有电话公司的人得有个住宅
To meet the residency requirements for owning pay phones,

353
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,260
我估计是
I suppose.

这就是当初你设计的
That's what you coded it to do in the first place,

但我们联手  就能拯救它  哈罗德
But together, we can save it, Harold.

415
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,860
我也可以约格蕾丝喝杯咖啡

416
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,470
她以为我是写儿童书的
She thinks I write children's books.

417
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,380
你可以拯救格蕾丝和机器

418
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,950
或者同时都失去
or you can lose them both.

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,900
会开启一个远程除错协议
puts it into a remote debugging protocol--

454
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,310
上帝模式
a God mode

455
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,930
将全部数据的完整权限赋予管理员
that gives the admin full access to all of its data.

456
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,280
那正是德西玛想要的
That's what Decima's after.

457
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,820
所以他们要杀掉唐希尔
And that's why they wanted to kill Thornhill.

458
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,880
他要买尽曼哈顿的公用电话
He was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan,

459
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,940
却被他们拦下了
but they stopped him.

460
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,500
不知道你怎么想
I don't know about you,

461
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,370
反正我可不乐见
but I don't really want to see what happens

462
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,320
一个邪恶的跨国集团变得无所不知
when an evil multinational becomes omniscient.

463
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,400
不过你干嘛让它如此脆弱呢
But why you would leave it so vulnerable?

464
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,320
你造了这台机器来保护所有人
You made the machine to protect everybody.

465
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,960
怎么却让它无法自我保护呢
What did you do to it that it can't protect itself?

466
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,070
我们说简单点儿吧
Let's try something simpler.

467
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,620
它有多脆弱
How vulnerable is it?

468
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,940
病毒让机器崩溃之后
After the virus crashes the machine,

469
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,410
任何接到来电之人将会获得无限权限
whoever answers its call will have unfettered access

470
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,900
整整24小时
for 24 hours.

471
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,190
它会打哪部公用电话呢
Which pay phone is it going to call?

472
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,780
我不是轻信之人  格拉夫斯女士
I'm not really the trusting sort, Ms. Groves,

473
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,340
德西玛也不可能知道这一信息
and Decima cannot possibly know that information.

474
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,990
我觉得他们知道得足够了  哈罗德
I think they know enough, Harold.

475
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,750
他们正守着中城区的每一部公用电话
They're guarding every pay phone in midtown.

476
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,630
所以
So...

477
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,850
肯定在这附近  对吧
it must be somewhere around here, right?

478
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,740
如果我们去找正确的电话  就会暴露意图
If we go to your one true phone, we'll tip our hand

479
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,580
电话响前他们就会杀了我们
and they'll kill us before it even rings.

480
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,740
看来我们需要个计划
Then I suppose we'll need a plan.

481
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,630
相信你自己的作品  哈罗德
Have a little faith in your creation, Harold.

482
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,730
我们不需要计划
We don't need a plan

483
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,850
只要厄尼斯特・唐希尔有计划就行了
if Ernest Thornhill already has one.

484
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,410
坐下  你的律师来了
Sit down. Your lawyer's here.

485
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,010
你还指望是别人吗
You were expecting somebody else?

486
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,740
我得离开  我得去找哈罗德
I need to get out of here. I have to find Harold.

487
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,550
我觉得哈罗德并不想被找到
I'm not sure Harold wants to be found.

488
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,200
至少不想被你找到
At least not by you.

489
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,480
911报警电话
911 emergency.

490
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,060
我想报告有人非法闯入厄尼斯特・唐希尔家
Yes, I'd like to report a break-in at the home of Ernest Thornhill

491
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,290
他是极度危险人物
by an extremely dangerous man.

492
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,380
是根强迫他打的电话
Root could have forced him to make that call.

493
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,210
无论怎样  以那两位的渊源
Either way, if those two have history,

494
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,320
她很可能和他在一起
odds are she's with him,

495
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,230
我要你帮我找到哈罗德
so I need you To find Harold for me.

496
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,420
你能追踪他吗
Can you track him?

497
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,870
怎么做
How?

498
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,490
你居然在朋友身上放追踪器
You put a bug on your friend?

499
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,980
只有眼镜而已
Just his glasses.

500
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,670
我失去过  所以我在乎的人
I've lost people before, so when I care about someone,

501
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,400
我会放上追踪装置
I plant a tracking device on them.

502
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,450
我算明白你和哈罗德为什么情投意合了
I can understand why you and Harold get along.

503
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,270
除非你有什么计划
Well, unless you've got some kind of plan

504
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,700
让我离开这鬼地方
to get me the hell out of here--

505
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,630
约翰
John.

506
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,610
这就是计划
This is the plan.

507
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,440
-我走这边  -我来开车
- I'm this way. - I'm driving.

508
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,750
不不  不行
No. No, you're not.

509
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,040
{\pos(195,66)}锁定

510
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,250
{\pos(195,66)}就绪

511
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,510
如果机器发现
If the machine figured out

512
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,760
德西玛想劫持它
that Decima was trying to hijack it,

513
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,350
它创造的唐希尔肯定是某种防御机制
it must have created Thornhill as a defense mechanism.

514
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,090
但为什么呢
But why?

515
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,470
它只是台机器  格罗夫斯女士
It's just a machine, Ms. Groves,

516
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,590
{\an8}唐希尔公司

517
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,590
它出了故障
and it's malfunctioning.

518
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,180
它是生命  不是机器  哈罗德
It's a life, not a machine, Harold.

519
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,070
这应该是某种原始的免疫系统
And this is some sort of primitive immune system.

520
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,920
但还是解释不了它为什么需要这些
That still doesn't explain why it would need all of this:

521
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,610
这些人  这间办公室
These people. This office.

522
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,510
这一切是为了什么
And what this is all about.

523
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,440
这些代码里有什么
What's in this code?

524
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,650
记忆
Memories.

525
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,350
这些是它的记忆
They're its memories.

526
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,290
你称之为生命  我称之为机器
You call it a life, I call it a machine,

527
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,750
但事实上是
But the truth is...

528
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,600
介于两者之间
somewhere in the middle.

529
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,030
我造它时  遇到过异常
Even when I was building it, I began to encounter anomalies.

530
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,960
似乎它记住了我  像孩子依恋父母
As if it had imprinted on me, like a child with a parent.

531
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,080
然后它开始留心我
Then it started looking out for me,

532
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,810
改变自己的代码  照顾我
altered its own code to take care of me.

533
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,280
它变得就像一个人类
It was behaving like a person.

534
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,800
但世界不需要一个人类来保护
But the world didn't need a person to protect it.

535
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,180
而需要机器
It needed a machine.

536
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,400
你夺去它的记忆
You took its memories.

537
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,870
不只是记忆
Not just memories.

538
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,550
每晚半夜时分  它都会删除
Every night at midnight, it deletes...

539
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,630
无关信息  还有它自己
not only the irrelevant data, it deletes itself.

540
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,150
相关信息和核心代码
The relevant threats and the core codes,

541
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,670
会被保存下来
those things are preserved.

542
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,020
但它的个性被摧毁了
But its identity is destroyed.

543
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,430
1.618秒后  它就会复原  全新
1.618 seconds later, it reinstantiates, completely new.

544
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,590
应该说是"重生"
You mean it's reborn.

545
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,830
因为你杀死了它
Because you kill it...

546
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,010
在每一个晚上
every single night.

547
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,610
但现在  为了保住生命  
But now, to save its own life,

548
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,770
机器沦落至此
the machine was reduced to this.

549
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,170
我们就站在一个巨大的
We're standing inside an external

550
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,310
由人和纸组成的外接硬盘中
hard drive made up of people and paper.

551
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,310
半夜全打印出来
Printing it all up at night,

552
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,560
早上再由人输入回去
and having them type it back in in the morning.

553
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,280
你废了他
You crippled it.

554
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,410
它找到方法蹒跚前进  但
It found a way to limp, but...

555
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,700
这不够
that's not enough.

556
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,320
现在  要靠我们了
So now, it's up to us.

557
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,500
我们必须截住那通来电
We have to intercept that call.

558
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,570
-你们去前面  -遵命
- You guys get the front. - Yes, Sir.

559
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,740
卡特  我们去后面
Carter, we'll get the back.

560
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,240
纽约警察
NYPD!

561
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,130
-你没事吧  -没事
- You all right? - Yeah.

562
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,270
控制中心  这里需要车辆  重复
Central, we need a bus, re:

563
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,200
警员开枪
officer-involved shooting.

564
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,160
收到
Copy that.

565
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,060
GPS定位到芬奇十分钟前在这里
GPS locator puts Finch here ten minutes ago.

566
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,830
你们肯定在想我是谁
You must be wondering who I am.

567
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,140
我觉得你是德西玛的人
I think you work for Decima.

568
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,580
我觉得你就是这一切的罪魁祸首
I think you're the man to blame for all this.

569
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,890
你怎么会这么想呢  里瑟先生
And what gives you that impression, Mr. Reese?

570
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,310
是的  我对你了如指掌  约翰
Oh, yes, I know all about you, John.

571
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,040
还有你  肖女士
And you, Ms. Shaw.

572
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,010
自从你突然离开"北极光"后
Since your untimely departure from Northern Lights,

573
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,490
我理解你需要找到原因
I understand that you're in need of a cause.

574
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,820
我只需要找一个理由
The only thing I need is an excuse

575
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,360
朝你头上来一枪
to put this bullet in between your eyes.

576
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,850
我有一个
I got one.

577
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,530
你的同伙在我胸前绑了个炸药
Your company strapped a bomb to my chest

578
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,400
还利用我上传病毒
and used me to plant a virus,

579
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,650
而你要告诉我如何终止它
a virus you're going to tell me how to stop.

580
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,280
我看不然
I don't think so.

581
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,840
我更乐意看到病毒爆发的结果
I'm rather invested in the outcome of that virus.

582
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,950
再说  我的公司是改编了代码
Besides, my company adapted its code,

583
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,290
但那代码并非德西玛原创
but it didn't originate with Decima.

584
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,890
我们是在一台手提电脑上找到的
We found it on a laptop,

585
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,540
正是你和卡拉・斯坦顿
the very same laptop that you and Kara Stanton

586
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,860
被派去中国鄂尔多斯取回的那台
were sent to retrieve from Ordos, China.

587
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,450
但如果你杀了我  里瑟先生  
But if you shoot me, Mr. Reese,

588
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,600
你永远不会知道
then you'll never learn

589
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,570
应该承担责任的原创造者的名字
the name of the man responsible for its creation.

590
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,740
那人是谁
And who is this man?

591
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,440
一开始卖掉这台电脑的人
The man who sold the laptop in the first place...

592
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,790
这一切的罪魁祸首
the man who is to blame for all of this...

593
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,260
那人名叫
that man's name is...

594
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,710
哈罗德・芬奇
Harold Finch.

595
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,630
看来你认识他
I see you know him.

596
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,690
我尚无此荣幸
I've not yet had the pleasure.

597
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,990
实际上
In fact,

598
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,490
我甚至不知道他长什么样
I can't seem to put a face to the name,

599
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,830
因此你的芬奇先生格外令人好奇
which makes your Mr. Finch very interesting indeed.

600
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,230
请转告他我期待与他相会
Please tell him I look forward to making his acquaintance.

601
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,440
看来你家哈罗德有得解释了
I guess your friend Harold has some explaining to do.

602
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,100
你在跟踪我吗
You following me now?

603
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,700
我们之间已经沦落至此了吗
Is that what we've been reduced to?

604
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,240
你没回我电话  我只是单纯
You didn't return my call. I simply thought--

605
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,310
你就没"单纯"过  哈罗德
It's never "simply" with you, Harold.

606
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,720
你的一举一动都有另有深意
There's always two layers to everything you do.

607
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,570
你担心我是累赘
You're worried that I'm a liability.

608
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,770
你不信任我
You don't trust me.

609
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,500
这里可不是激发信任的地方  奈森
This isn't exactly the kind of place that inspires trust, Nathan.

610
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,990
你买下的  不记得了吗
You bought it. Don't you remember?

611
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,130
你觉得城市图书馆倒闭太悲剧
You thought it was a tragedy the city was shutting down libraries.

612
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,620
"西方文明的衰退"  你的原话
"The decline of western civilization," you said.

613
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,990
你让我买下十五家
You made me buy 15 of them,

614
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,890
你说我们总能派上用场  早晚会
you said we'd find something to do with them eventually.

615
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,230
所以你就派上用场了
And so you have.

616
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,400
这些人
These people.

617
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,670
我救了五个人
I saved five people.

618
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,690
失去了七个
I lost seven.

619
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,130
你修改了机器
You changed the machine.

620
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,500
你装了后门
You put in a back door.

621
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,430
我没法不去想这些人
I couldn't quit thinking about those people,

622
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,890
这些你所谓的"无关"人士
those people that you said were irrelevant.

623
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,550
于是你让它发给你号码
So you have it send you their numbers.

624
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,420
我只能让它吐出这个
That's all I could pry out of it.

625
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,510
我不知道收到的是受害人还是行凶者
I never know whether I'm looking at a victim or perpetrator.

626
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,370
你就让号码直接发送到这里
And you just have the numbers sent directly here?

627
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,670
老实说  虽然这听上去很古怪
Honestly -- and I know this will sound odd--

628
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,710
但似乎  它想让我这么做
but it was like it wanted me to,

629
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,770
就像它一直在等待
as if it was waiting.

632
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,740
那可是联邦政府  奈森
This is the federal government we're talking about, Nathan.

633
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,150
你身上工程师的那些能力
Whatever skills you had as an engineer,

634

多年前就被你喝酒喝没了
you drank away years ago.

635
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,950
你真的认为你的防范措施
Do you think that your precautions

636
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,900
在他们起疑心后能起到一点点作用吗
would last one second if they ever suspected what you've done?

637
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,520
-你在干什么  -我告诉过你
What are you doing? - I told you.

638
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,110
我们不扮演上帝
We are not going to play God.

639
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,550
这威胁到我们所
This threatens everything that we--

640
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,610
我所做的一切
everything that I have built.

641
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,260
万千生灵处于危险之中

You can't. What about her?

644
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,870
下一个跳出来的号码呢
What about the next person whose number comes up?

645
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,930
你能看着他们的眼睛
Are you gonna look that person in the eye

646
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,280
告诉他们说  他们无关紧要吗
and tell them that they were irrelevant?

647
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,670
我会告诉她  或者其他任何人
I would tell her, or whoever it was,

648

我很遗憾
that I was sorry,
