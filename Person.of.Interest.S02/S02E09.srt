才攒够钱带他的老婆孩子过来

245
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,550
甘愿做出什么事呢

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,760
我黑进了古巴的政府数据库

247
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,530

毫无疑问  是俄罗斯人提供的

古巴记录了所有叛逃者的资料

看来奥多涅斯是古巴国家队

254
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,740
00到05年间的投手

260
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,690
他的妻子就会进监狱

262
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,660

特勤局的

367

不知道是谁告诉他们的

反正我们接到消息时他们已经围在尸体旁了

无意冒犯  但这案子有保密级别

375
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,200
不过  既然尸体出现在纽约

376

让人好奇另一半去哪里了

但我们会继续搜查这块区域

公汽  出租车
Town car? Cab?

390
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,190
如果找到谁载他过来的
Maybe if we find out who drove him here,

391
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,390
也许就能找到凶手
we could find the shooter.

392
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,860
或者目击证人

393

你们排查整个区域  我们去调阅监控摄像

GPS显示那位司机昨晚在晨间公园

399
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,310
逗留了至少25分钟
for a window of 25 minutes last night,

400
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,110
正是某位俄罗斯人
right around the time

401
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,640
中枪身亡的时段
some Russian guy succumbs to acute lead poisoning.

402

你觉得那位出租车司机
And you think our cab driver

403
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,660
和这起谋杀案有关
is connected to this homicide?

404
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,920
我还以为你能告诉我
Figured you could tell me.

405
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,390
还有  为什么特勤局要掺和
Along with, why are the Secret Service crawling

406
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,820
这起调查
all over this investigation?

407
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,930
我不知道
I have no idea.

408
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,890
要是你能调查出的话  感激不尽
But whatever you can find out would be much appreciated.

409
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,000
不太可能
Unlikely,

410
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,120
因为他们跟你们一样
considering they're about as forthcoming

411
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
不太爱分享信息
with information as you are.

412
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,050
我尽力而为吧
I'll see what I can find out.

瓦蒂姆・普什科夫
Vadim Pushkov.

415
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,860
既然牵涉到了特勤局
If the Secret Service is involved,

416
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,890
那他有可能是国际罪犯
he's likely some kind of international criminal.

417
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,470
看来这位司机昨晚载了不该载的人
Seems like our cabbie gave the wrong guy a ride last night.

418
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,620
从59街大桥走  去皇后区

我似乎没法黑进这个女人的手机
I can't seem to access this woman's phone.

423
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,930
她不是没有手机

424
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,460
就是手机关机了
or it's currently turned off.

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,430
他们要过桥去皇后区
They're taking the Bridge into Queens.

一直往下开
Now take this all the way down

越走越窄的单行道
One-way street that bottlenecks down the way.

432
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,250
就停在这吧
This is good right here.

433
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,790
他们停在路当中了
They're stopped in the middle of the block.

434
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,400
她在引他入套  芬奇
She's isolated him, Finch.

435
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,200
11.5美元

我每天都要见很多人

他叫普什科夫  你载过他

442
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,360
他有落下什么东西吗
Did he leave anything behind?

443
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,600
别对我说谎
Do not lie to me.

我找不到的
I didn't find it.

抱歉  不载客了
Sorry, I'm not in service.

450

实际上
Here's the thing.

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,440
你最好还是载我一程
You're gonna want to give me a lift anyway.

452

我今天倒霉透了  知道不

你还是  下车好吧

现在听好了
Now listen up.

458
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,980
我们被围堵了  大概有两辆车

459
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,310
四到六个枪手

460
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,660
我要你瞄准他们车的后围侧板
I want you to aim for the rear quarter panel of their car,

461
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,200
别松油门直撞过去  明白吗
and don't let off the gas, you got that?

462
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,370
就是现在  费尔曼
Now's a good time, Fermin.

463
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,590
-等等  什么  -快  费尔曼
- Wait, what? - Now, Fermin.

464
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,470
里瑟先生  你没事吧
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

465
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,380
我没事  芬奇
I'm fine, Finch.

466
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,810
不过真正的威胁找上门了
But I think the real threat just found us.

467
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,370
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

468
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,750
他们是什么人
Who are those people?

469
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,360
里瑟先生  那个把他引入陷阱的金发女人
Mr. Reese, the blonde who led him into the trap

470
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,350
一下车就打了个电话
made a call just after leaving the cab.

471
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,500
我没法完整辨别
I can't quite make it out.

472
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,900
但我确信她讲的是爱沙尼亚语
But I believe it's Estonian.

473
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,140
爱沙尼亚黑帮
Estonian Mob.

474
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,840
我认出他们的手法了
I recognize their methods.

475
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,540
围杀
It was a kill box.

476
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,530
在俄罗斯有过类似经历
Had a similar experience in Russia.

477
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,590
他们可没成功
Didn't work out too well for them.

478
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,770
关掉GPS
Disabled the GPS.

479
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,450
不能冒险让他们追踪到你
Can't risk them accessing it to track you down.

480
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,630
你是谁
Who are you?

481
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,500
搭车人
Just a guy who needed a ride.

482
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,920
那个女人问了你昨天载的一个乘客
That woman asked about a passenger in your cab last night.

483
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,990
他叫普什科夫  他怎么了
His name is Pushkov. What happened to him?

484
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,450
我不认识这个普什科夫
I don't know this Pushkov!

485
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,660
我只是个出租车司机
I'm just a cab driver!

486
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,090
你还准备像对那个女人一样对我撒谎吗
What, you're gonna lie to me like you lied to that woman?

487
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,030
这可大不一样  费尔曼
There's a big difference here, Fermin.

488
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,300
我是唯一能够帮你的人  明白吗
I'm the only one who can help you, you understand?

489
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,450
你为什么要帮我
So why are you helping me?

490
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,030
也许因为你是个正直的人
Maybe you're an honest guy

491
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,060
只是犯了点小错误
who just made a mistake.

492
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,310
但你得想清楚  你这条命是否值钱过
But you need to decide whether your life's worth more

493
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,100
那人落在出租车里的东西
than whatever that guy left in your cab.

494
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,610
好吧
Okay.

495
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,840
我在机场载上那个人
I picked this guy up near the airport, huh?

496
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,480
我们开了好一会儿  他看起来很紧张
We drove around for a while. He seemed nervous.

497
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,950
他用俄语打电话
He spoke in Russian on his cell phone.

498
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,850
-你懂俄语吗  -一点点
- You understand Russian? - A little.

499
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,170
我小时候在古巴  我祖父说俄语
My grandfather spoke it when I was a kid in Cuba.

500
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,380
听起来他是想要卖掉什么东西
It sounded like he was trying to sell something.

501
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,620
他管那东西叫  "HSAID"
He called it, uh, "HSAID",

502
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,830
还有什么  "旅客"
Or--or--or "Travelers".

503
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,710
我不知道他在讲什么
I didn't know what he was talking about.

504
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,380
那个金发女人说他落了东西在你车上
That blonde lady said he left something in your cab.

505
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,360
是什么
What was it?

506
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,410
我不是警察  费尔曼
I'm not a cop here, Fermin,

507
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,010
但如果你想要我帮你  你得告诉我
But if you want my help, you need to tell me

508
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,190
他落了什么在你车里
what he left in your cab.

509
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,010
一台手提电脑
He left a laptop.

510
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,630
他落在座位下面了
He left it underneath the seat.

511
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,590
肯定是忘了拿
He must have forgot.

512
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,330
你怎么处理的
What'd you do with it?

513
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,880
卖了
I sold it...

514
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,490
卖给一个朋友换钱了
to a friend for money.

515
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,840
我本来不是这种人  但是
Look, I never do that, but--

516
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
我载着他开了一天
I drive him around all day

517
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,070
然后他居然没付钱
and then he stiffed me on the tab.

518
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,970
-芬奇  你在吗  -永远都在  里瑟先生
- Finch, are you there? - Always, Mr. Reese.

519
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,860
看来普什科夫做了笔交易
Sounds like this Pushkov had some kind of a deal

520
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,600
要把手提电脑卖给了爱沙尼亚帮
to sell the laptop to the Estonians.

521
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,240
但他却落在了出租车上
But then he leaves it in the cab?

522
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,650
他知道会有危险
He knew it would be dangerous.

523
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,510
想谈个更高的价钱
He wanted to negotiate a higher price.

524
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,710
显然  爱沙尼亚帮可没心情谈价
Clearly, the Estonians were in no mood to negotiate.

525
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,790
那台手提电脑上会有什么东西
What in the world could be on that laptop?

526
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,490
-你在跟谁说话  -我的合伙人
- Who are you talking to? - My business partner.

527
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,460
爱沙尼亚帮不在乎手提电脑是不是在他手上
Estonians don't care if he doesn't have the laptop.

528
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,070
他们杀他是因为他知情
They'll kill him just because he knew about it.

529
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,430
就为了一台手提电脑
Just because of a laptop?

530
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,530
是为了手提电脑里的东西  找回它
Because of what was on it, and getting it back

531
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,610
可能是保你小命的唯一筹码
may be the only leverage we have to keep you alive.

532
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,150
先从你卖给的那位朋友开始

他们会杀掉所有
And they're willing to kill anyone

564
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,210
接触过电脑的人
who comes in contact with it.

565
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,260
我黑进了阿齐兹的电子邮箱
I've gotten into Aziz's email account.

566
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,260
这里显示他把手提电脑卖给了
It appears that he sold the laptop

567
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,410
一个名叫D3MN8的线上买家
to an online buyer named "D3MN8."

568
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,870
有什么方法能找到他吗
Any way we can track him?

569
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,470
如果D3MN8发现了电脑上的东西
If D3MN8 discovers what's on the laptop,

570
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,760
他会想转手卖掉
he may try to flip it.

571
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,030
在这种情况下  他可能会去黑暗网路
In which case, he'd probably go to the Darknet,

572
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,920
在丝绸之路或其他黑市论坛上出售
try to sell it on Silkroad or one of those black market forums.

573
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,860
我会试着追踪他
I'll try to track him down,

574
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,420
看能否安排一次会面
see if I can negotiate a meeting.

575
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
阿齐兹怎么办
What about Aziz?

576
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,350
纽约警方会很快到这里
The NYPD will be here shortly...

577
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,400
调查杀害你朋友的凶手
find out who did this to your friend.

578
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,410
我们快走吧
We better get moving.

579
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,070
因为下一个目标就是你
'cause you're gonna be next.

580
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,850
让我猜猜
Let me guess,

581
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,740
那位司机招认了
your driver confessed

582
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,290
是他在公园里杀了那俄罗斯人
to killing the Russian in the park.

583
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,400
不尽然
Not exactly.

584
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,040
你想听好消息还是坏消息
You want the good news or the bad news?

585
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,160
先说好消息吧
Start with the good.

586
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,510
普什科夫是被爱沙尼亚黑帮杀的
Pushkov was killed by the Estonian Mob.

587
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,560
他们在找他落在出租车上的手提电脑
They're chasing a laptop he left in our driver's cab.

588
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,070
所以特勤局的才会围着尸体转
Which explains the Secret Service swarming the body.

589
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,800
他们为什么迫切想得到那台手提电脑
Why do they want this laptop so bad?

590
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,090
还不清楚  可他们会杀掉所有
Don't know yet, but they're willing to kill anyone

591
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,480
接触过电脑的人
who comes in contact with it.

592
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,040
留意一个金发女人
Keep an eye out for a blonde.

593
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,710
她是负责人
She runs point for them.

594
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,170
我去调警方的爱沙尼亚帮简报
I'll pull our analytical brief on the Estonians.

595
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,130
那坏消息是什么
Now, what's the bad news?

596
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,780
他们刚扔下另一具尸体
They just dropped another body.

597
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,170
我会把地址发给你
I'll text you the address.

598
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,140
我真不该拿走那台手提电脑
I never should have taken that laptop.

599
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,050
我就知道这整件事都是个错误
I knew this whole thing was a mistake!

600
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,560
不管我做什么  到头来都不对
No matter what I do, nothing seems to turn out right.

601
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,320
你是指  你是怎么决定
You mean, how you chose to get involved

602
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,970
和门多萨这种走私贩扯上关系的
with a smuggler like Mendoza?

603
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,190
门多萨是我们的联系人
Wh--Mendoza was our contact.

604
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,460
我们逃出来后
When we defected,

605
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,430
他就为我们这些棒球手安排好一切
he arranged everything for us ballplayers.

606
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,160
他把我们一路带到纽约
He brought us all the way to New York.

607
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,960
作为回报  你们挣的钱要分给他
In exchange, he takes a cut of your contract when you get paid?

608
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,600
门多萨说这是规矩
Mendoza said that's the way it worked.

609
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,700
他承诺得天花乱坠
He promises the moon.

610
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,770
我以为棒球  这个国家
I thought baseball, this country,

611
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,410
能让我赚到钱
was gonna make me rich,

612
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,400
可这个局
but this game...

613
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,720
还是取决于自己
you know, it lies to you.

614
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,590
你一受伤  就完了
And once you got injured, it was over.

615
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,820
打不了球  赚不了钱
You can't play, you can't make money.

616
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,290
就变得无人问津
You become a nobody.

617
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
所以门多萨找到了另一条途径
So Mendoza figured he'd find another way

618
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,290
从你们身上吸金
to get his money out of you.

619
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,620
-你的家人  -对  他说他会帮我
- Your family. - Yeah, he said he'd help.

620
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,310
可现在他一味压榨我  毫不在乎
But now he's sticking it to me. He doesn't care.

621
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
有时我希望我从没离开古巴
Sometimes I wish that I'd never left Cuba.

622
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,850
你的所作所为很勇敢
You did a brave thing.

623
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,200
背井离乡  为家人谋求更好的生活
Leaving to find a better life for your family.

624
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,050
美国梦  不是吗
American dream, right?

625
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,800
找份好工作  买栋大房子
You get a good job, you buy a house.

626
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,220
我宁可全都不要  只要能再见家人一面
I'd trade all that in just to see my family one more time.

627
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,460
看着儿子长大  你知道吗
To see my son grow up, you know?

628
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,550
他几乎都不认识我了
He doesn't even know who I am anyway.

629
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,930
我可以帮你挽回  费尔曼
I can help you make things right, Fermin.

630
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,160
但你得相信我
But you've got to trust me.

631
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,160
我有别的选择吗
Do I have a choice?

632
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,830
你那个线人
This CI of yours...

633
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,700
他怎么知道爱沙尼亚帮杀了普什科夫
how does he know the Estonians killed Pushkov?

634
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,870
他们在找他带的一台手提电脑
They're hunting a laptop he had on him.

635
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,750
你知道里面有什么吗
You know what's on that thing?

636
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,710
-你知道吗  警探  -还不知道
- Do you, Detective? - Not yet.

637
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,460
可我有很强的预感
But I'm getting a strong premonition

638
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,090
里面的东西会让政府颇为难堪
that whatever it is, it can embarrass the government.

639
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,140
我说得对吗
Am I right?

640
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,700
我只想帮忙
Look, I'm only trying to help.

641
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,210
瓦蒂姆・普什科夫是名独来独往的黑客高手
Vadim Pushkov was a lone wolf hacker extraordinaire.

642
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,180
{\pos(274,138)}机密

643
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,440
五年前我们第一次注意到他
We first noticed him five years ago.

644
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,240
他偷了十万个信用卡账号
He stole over 100,000 credit card numbers.

645
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,460
他第二次出现时
The next time he turned up,

646
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,440
侵入了内华达的无人机引航站
he hacked into a drone pilot station in Nevada

647
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,910
把飞行控制加密协议在线出售给了
and sold the flight control encryption protocol online

648
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,470
一名巴基斯坦的买家
to a buyer in Pakistan.

649
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,150
这么说他再次出现了
So, he showed up on your radar again,

650
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,690
你们希望在他出售所窃资料前抓住他
and you guys hoped to catch him before he sold whatever he stole.

651
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,220
问题是  我们不知道
Problem is, we have no idea

652
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,910
普什科夫这次黑到什么了
what Pushkov was up to this time.

653
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,560
要是那台手提电脑
Afraid to even think about what would happen

654
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,800
误入敌手  后果不堪设想
if the contents of that laptop slipped into the wrong hands.

655
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,250
未知号码信息
HTSC电脑店
第九东大街 3424号

656
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,830
未知号码信息
HTSC电脑店
第九东大街 3424号

657
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,810
你跟我来吧
You might want to come with me.

658
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,260
去哪里
Where are we going?

659
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,310
在曼哈顿东村的一家电脑店发现一具尸体
Body dropped at a computer store in the East Village.

660
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,520
最后卖出那台手提电脑的人
Last guy to sell the laptop.

661
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,450
里瑟先生  我还在继续搜寻D3MN8
Mr. Reese, my search for D3MN8 continues.

662
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,970
不过我想我已经发现
But I think I may have discovered

663
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,990
普什科夫手提电脑上是什么东西了
what was on Pushkov's laptop.

664
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,190
是什么  芬奇
What is it, Finch?

665
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,130
卡特警探说
Detective Carter said

666
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,040
他们发现普什科夫在肯尼迪机场
they found a $275 receipt on Pushkov

667
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,950
短期停车的面值275块钱的收据
for short-term parking at JFK.

668
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,780
275块
$275?

669
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,420
这可一点也不"短期"
Nothing short-term about that.

670
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,160
确实不短  他没有飞往任何地方
No, and he wasn't flying anywhere.

671
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,680
所以既然奥多涅斯听到他说"HSAID"
So if Ordonez heard him say "HSAID",

672
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,150
可能他说的是
It's possible that he's speaking about

673
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,140
国土安全局自动身份识别数据库
the Homeland Security Automated Identification Database.

674
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,310
我看应该是他偷了
My best guess is he stole information

675
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,590
大量的乘客信息
on a huge number of travelers:

676
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,810
地址  联调局清关数据  生物识别数据
Addresses, FBI clearances, biometric data.

677
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,230
就是说他们可以随意
Means they could sneak whoever they wanted

678
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,730
盗用任何人的身份入境
directly into the country using stolen credentials.

679
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,020
恐怖分子肯定想染指
Terrorists could get their hands on this.

680
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,190
无人知晓的情况下  这漏洞才有价值
A breach like that only has value if no one knows about it.

681
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,790
因此他们要杀死所有
Which is why they're killing everybody

682
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,750
接触过手提电脑的人
that comes in contact with the laptop.

683
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,700
我的怀疑得到了证实
My suspicions are confirmed.

684
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,940
我发现D3MN8在他常去的
I found the laptop listed

685
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,380
黑暗网络聊天频道挂出了手提电脑
on a Darknet IRC channel frequented by D3MN8.

686
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,520
他要价五万美金
He's trying to sell it for $50,000.

687
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,670
他发现了他手里的东西
He's discovered what he's got in his hands

688
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,590
相当值钱
and what it's worth.

689
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,650
他得先有命花钱
If he lives that long.

690
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,840
我会买下来  安排会面
I'll try to make a buy, set up a meet.

691
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,710
里瑟先生  我设法和D3MN8
Mr. Reese, I've managed to connect with D3MN8

692
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,930
在黑市取得了联系
on the black market.

693
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,890
我们已经商定好了手提电脑的价格
We've agreed on a price for the laptop.

694
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,190
现在正给你发送
Sending you the address now

695
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,720
约见的交易地址
to meet up with him for the buy.

696
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,160
这是什么地方
What is this place?

697
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,230
芬奇  这里没人
Finch, there's no one here.

698
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,050
这地方是空的
This place is empty.

699
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,410
什么叫"空的"
What do you mean, empty?

700
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,650
屋里只有我们两个人
We may be the only ones in this room...

701
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,190
但我们还有伴儿
but we're not alone.

702
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,520
有人在监视我们
We're being watched.

703
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,070
我是弗斯科
Fusco.

704
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,290
鲍曼会过去接你
Bowman will swing by and pick you up.

705
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,650
你们俩拿上包裹  按计划送达
You two will get the package, deliver it as planned.

706
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,960
听着  我想过了
Hey, listen, I've been thinking about this.

707
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
我做不到
I can't do it.

708
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,720
我得自保
I got to keep my nose clean...

709
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,850
我被抓了对你也没什么好处
because I'm no good to you locked up.

710
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,440
我肯定我们会为你

你早前想买这台手提电脑

但我不喜欢你搭档的样子

消失  至少一年内不再出现

他们会杀了你

那你为什么想要
Then why would you want it?

796
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
这就不劳你费心了
Let me worry about that.

797

I think you have something that belongs to me.

805

打开看过了吗
Did you open it?

806
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,370
没必要  我知道里面有什么 
I don't have to. I know what's on it.

807

我不会让你拿走它的
And I know I'll never let you take it.
