兰德尔先生  你被录用了
Mr. Randall, you are hired,

165

谁会指望
But why would anyone

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,950
巴西人能准时呢

卡特警探
Detective Carter.

320
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,900
你不该这样偷偷跟着我
Shouldn't sneak up on me like that.

321
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,270
你在找约翰
You're looking for John?

322
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,540
我觉得陈尸房里应该找不到他
I don't think you're gonna find him in the morgue.

323
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,070
多谢提醒  警探
Appreciate the advice, Detective,

324
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,620
不过我已经不再寻找你的朋友了
but I'm no longer looking for your friend.

325
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,420
我被调职了
I was reassigned.

326
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,650
真可惜
That's a shame.

327
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,780

It truly is.

328
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,280
你伤了腿吗
You hurt your leg?

329
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
老伤了
Old mistake.

330
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,620
时不时折磨我一下
Comes back to haunt me now and then.

331

上臂有道五公分的切口

337
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,090
那是正常验尸伤口吗
Is that standard autopsy procedure?

338
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,320
不  不是
Nope, it's not.

339
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,580
没有肿胀  没有血块
No swelling, no clotting,

340
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,240
验尸报告中也没有记录
and no record of it in the ME's report,

341
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,880
因此伤口一定是在验尸后才造成的
which means it must've happened after the autopsy was performed.

342
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,310
你把报告背过了
You memorize the report,

343
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,780
还是突然想到了
or you just know that off the top of your head?

466
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,830
你觉得保罗和这事有关吗
You think Paul had something to do with this?

467
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,100
不太可能
Unlikely.

468
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,710
保罗死了
Paul's dead.

469
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,370
警方认为他是自杀
Police think he committed suicide

470
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,770
就在和你一起的那个晚上
the same night that you were with him.

471
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,640
如果保罗是自杀
If Paul committed suicide,

472
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,260
那为什么这些人要找上我
then why would those men be after me?

473
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,580
如果他是自杀
If he committed suicide,

474
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,240
他们就不会找你了
they wouldn't be.

475
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,770
你可以指证那人在现场
You can place this guy at the scene.

476
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,370
不止是我  还有盖比
Not just me. Gabi.

477
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,300
我得去找她  她也会有危险
I need to find her. She might be in danger too.

478
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,440
我会叫警方的朋友查看她的情况
I'll call a friend on the police force to check on her.

479
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,990
他们可以追踪到她的手机
They'll be able to track her cell phone.

480
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,100
我们必须马上找到她
We need to find her now.

481
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,500
不行  你得待在这儿
No, you need to stay here.

482
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,240
有人正试图杀你
Someone just tried to kill you.

483
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,430
她是我朋友  我一定要去
She's my friend. I'm going.

484
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,290
你拦不住我的
You can't stop me.

485
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,280
好吧  但等我们到后
Okay, but when we get there,

486
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,590
你要待在车里
you stay in the car.

487
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,820
-卡特  -警探  打扰了吗
- Carter. - Detective, is this a bad time?

488
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,580
没有  我  我只是偶然碰见了个
No. I, uh--I just ran into someone

489
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,710
很久没见过的人
I hadn't seen in a while.

490
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,730
我查到了225酒吧里那伙人身上的印记
I ID'd the branding on those bangers from club 225.

491
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,900
他们是14街黑手党的
They're 14th Street Mafia.

492
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,940
谢了  警探
Thank you, Detective.

493
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,680
麻烦查一下你的邮箱
Now, if you could just check your email...

494
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,490
认得右边这个男人吗
You recognize the man on the right?

495
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,880
保罗・罗曼诺  迷幻药贩子
Paul Romano. Designer drug peddler

496
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,700
据说四天前自杀了
who allegedly committed suicide four nights ago.

497
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,670
你听上去不太确定啊
You don't sound convinced.

498
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,670
顶层公寓的摄像机"恰巧"坏了
The penthouse cameras were conveniently malfunctioning.

499
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,610
这个人在保罗跳楼前和他在一起
The other guy was with Paul before he jumped.

500
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,730
-你认识他吗  -不认识
- Do you recognize him? - No.

501
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,500
但那个印记说明他也是14街黑手党的
But that branding he's got means he's 14th Street Mafia too.

502
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,470
我帮你查查这个人是谁
I'll work on getting a new name.

503
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,390
还有  我们想让你帮忙追踪一个手机号
Also, we need you to track a cell phone.

504
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,370
这女孩可能知道关于保罗被杀的情况
A girl who may know something about Paul's murder

505
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,660
可能身处险境
and who may be in trouble.

506
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,080
我来处理
I'll take care of it.

507
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,580
想出去走走吗
Would you like to go for a walk?

508
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,710
得先找条皮带
Well, let's get a leash.

509
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,940
你想要点奖励吧
I suppose you'll want some treats.

510
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,290
卡特  告诉我你找到盖比了
Carter, tell me you found Gabi.

511
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,120
她昨晚没回家
She never came home last night.

512
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,280
手机显示她在31街和1街交界处
Tracked her cell to 31st and 1st,

513
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,120
所以我就来找她了
so I came down to find her.

514
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,380
盖比在这儿
Gabi's here.

515
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,500
太好了  我们这就去
Great. We're on our way.

516
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,000
不用了  约翰
That's not a good idea, John.

517
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,860
我一眼就知道这个地址是哪儿
I recognized the address as soon as it came up.

518
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,220
31街和1街是市陈尸房
31st and 1st is the city morgue.

519
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,760
巡警在下城区发现了她的尸体
Couple uniforms found her body downtown.

520
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,330
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,780
索菲亚想一个人静一静
Sofia wanted some air.

522
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,110
我把她带到了全市唯一
I took her to the only place

523
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,770
能让人静一静的地方
in the city you can actually find any.

524
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,230
她怎么样了
How is she taking the news?

525
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,910
几乎跟期待中的一样
About as well as can be expected.

526
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,450
她最好的朋友被杀了  她很自责
Her best friend was murdered, and she blames herself.

527
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,030
芬奇
Listen, Finch,

528
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,420
我需要你过来看着索菲亚
I need you to come keep an eye on Sofia.

529
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,060
我要去找杀害盖比的凶手  她跟着我不安全
She's not safe with me if I'm out looking for Gabi's killer.

530
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,160
没问题  我很快到
Not a problem. I'll be there shortly.

531
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,070
我们只不过
So we'll just--

532
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,490
只不过出去一下
we'll just go outside.

533
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,800
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese,

534
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,170
我这边情况有点复杂
I seem to be having a bit of a complication.

535
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,250
恐怕没法去找你了
I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you.

536
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,000
没问题  哈罗德
No problem, Harold.

537
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,660
我叫弗斯科来
I'll call Fusco.

538
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,790
他肯定没什么重要事可做
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

539
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,600
我不能回领馆
I can't go back to the consulate.

540
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,360
我父亲  会让我招待巴西总统
My father, he'll make me play host to the Brazilian president.

541
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,740
但我应该出去
I should be out there

542
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,140
找到那个杀了我朋友的混蛋
finding the bastard who killed my friend.

543
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,910
那是警察的工作  索菲亚
That's for the police, Sofia.

544
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,120
不是你的
Not you.

545
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,550
那晚  盖比本来不想去的
You know, that night, Gabi didn't even want to come out.

546
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,130
她会去  因为我说我们要去
She came out because I said we had to.

547
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,910
我们就要去
We just had to.

548
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,900
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

549
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,180
你们只是在错误的时间去了错误的地方
You were at the wrong place at the wrong time.

550
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,170
永远都是错误的地方
They're all the wrong places.

551
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,990
我迷失了太久
I've been lost for so long.

552
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,090
我以为只要我一直寻找
I thought maybe if I kept looking,

553
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,830
我就能找到让我开心的地方
I might find somewhere that made me feel happy.

554
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,520
我从没想过有人会因此送命
I never thought anyone would get hurt.

555
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,660
我有段时间也迷失了
I've spent some time feeling lost.

556
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,470
后来呢
What changed?

557
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,420
有个人找到了我
Someone found me,

558
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,950
告诉我  我需要一个目标
told me I needed a purpose.

559
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,540
似乎是很棒的朋友
Sounds like a good friend.

560
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,310
他就是
He is.

561
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,120
走吧
Come on.

562
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,650
弗斯科警探会陪你参加
Detective Fusco will be looking after you

563
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,980
你父亲今晚的晚宴  索菲亚
at your father's party tonight, Sofia.

564
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,270
我明白
I get it.

565
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,800
我没他那么高  也没他敏捷
I'm not as tall as him, maybe not as fast.

566
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,320
尽管拿我开玩笑  我能忍
Go ahead, make fun of me. I can take it.

567
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,950
你长得像我叔叔雅各布
You look like my uncle Jacobo.

568
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,160
我们叫他Garanhao
We call him the Garanhao.

569
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,260
什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

570
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,570
种马  他可有女人缘了
Stud. He has great luck with the ladies.

571
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,880
别让她离开你的视线
Don't let her out of your sight.

572
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,450
干啥  你当我第一次吗
What's this, my first trip to the rodeo?

573
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,640
你喜欢[中东食物]法拉费吗
So you like falafel?

574
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,590
我查到了
I got an ID

575
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,180
录像里神秘男子的身份
on your mystery man from the video.

576
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,580
黑帮科查到叫蒙哥马利・斯宾塞  又名"好马"
Gang Unit ID'd Montgomery Spencer, aka Monty.

577
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,900
有暴力攻击和私藏毒品的犯罪记录
Record for assault and possession with intent.

578
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,500
他和保罗・罗曼诺之间有什么关联
What's his connection to Paul Romano?

579
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,180
这个我没查出来
That's what doesn't check out for me.

580
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,490
直到六个月前
Up until six months ago,

581
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,530
罗曼诺一直在向他的朋友兜售
Romano was selling small amounts

582
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,200
小量的夜店毒品
of club drugs to his friends.

583
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,320
但有传言说保罗开始卖
But word is Paul started moving

584
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,520
大量的迷幻药
huge quantities of designer drugs.

585
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,610
也许好马是他的供货人
Maybe if Monty was his supplier,

586
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,900
保罗想和他讨价还价
Paul tried to renegotiate his end.

587
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,720
看来这场讨价还价不如他意了
I'd say the negotiations didn't go his way.

588
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,680
有可能
Maybe.

589
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,920
我还是搞不懂这两个人
I still don't understand how these two

590
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,780
是怎么搞到一起去的
wind up in bed together.

591
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,950
好马多半有供货渠道
Monty might have had the hookup to the supplier,

592
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,000
罗曼诺有客源
and Romano the client base,

593
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,310
可他们谁都没有钱来提供资金支持啊
but neither of them had the money to bankroll it.

594
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,880
这么说他们还有个匿名合伙人
So they had a silent partner.

595
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,670
我不知道  不过我这有个地址
I don't know, but I got an address

596
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,790
是好马和他的狐朋狗友
to the bar where Monty and his pals

597
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,550
平时常去的
like to spend some time in.

598
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,750
我想我们去当面问他吧
Figured we'd go and ask him in person.

599
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,880
谢了  卡特
Thanks, Carter.

600
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,250
那不是令媛吗
Isn't that your daughter?

601
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,270
索菲亚  你去哪里了
Sofia, where have you been?

602
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,240
你还好吗
Is everything okay?

603
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,290
很好  只是
It's okay. I just--

604
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,090
来
Come.

605
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,760
一位巴西的老朋友想跟你打个招呼
An old friend from Brazil wants to say hello.

606
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
-这位是小女  索菲亚  -你好
- This is my daughter, Sofia. - Hi.

607
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,780
来电
好消息先生

608
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,010
既没个短信  又没个电话
You know, you don't write, you don't call.

609
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,060
人家虽然是大人了  但很敏感的
I mean, I'm a big guy, but I am sensitive.

610
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,290
我也很高兴和你通话  警探
It's good to talk to you too, Detective.

611
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,970
我们的朋友还安全吗
Is our friend safe?

612
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,410
可疑目标太多  人山人海
A target-rich environment. Lots of people.

613
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,530
所以我黑进了博物馆的摄像头
That's why I've accessed the museum's security cameras,

614
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,810
看了厨房的场景以后
and having seen the kitchen,

615
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,060
我建议你不要吃鲜虾泡芙

我在车里坐烦了
I got bored sitting in the car,

635
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,140
你用了不止四分钟

636
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,250
这家伙用霓虹灯砸我脑袋
Well, this guy hit me over the head with a neon sign,

637
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,080
真没运动精神
not very sportsmanlike.

638
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,890
他们都不肯告诉我
And none of them want to tell me

639
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,350
哪里能找到他们的朋友好马
where to find their pal Monty.

640
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,250
是啊  所以你应该先开口询问
Yeah, that's why you should ask them

641
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,970
然后再揍晕人家  约翰
before you knock them out, John.

642
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,510
里瑟先生  那天晚上还有另外一个男人
Mr. Reese, there was another man

643

在保罗・罗曼诺的顶层公寓里
at Paul Romano's penthouse that night,

644
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,200
索菲亚的男朋友杰克・休斯
Sofia's boyfriend Jack Hughes.

645
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,220
他就是提供资金支持的人
He's the bankroller.

646
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,670
弗斯科和索菲亚在一起
Fusco's with Sofia.

647
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,000
快通知他
Let him know.

弗斯科警探
Detective Fusco?

649
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,720
索菲亚在哪里
Where is Sofia?

650
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,150
补妆呢
Powdering her nose.

651
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,600
不  她没有
No, she isn't.

652
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,310
恐怕你去错地方了  里瑟先生
I'm afraid you're in the wrong place, Mr. Reese.

653
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,790
出租车
Taxi!

654
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,350
对此我非常抱歉  宝贝
I'm really sorry about this, babe.

655
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,270
抱歉
Sorry?

656
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,930
我不明白
I don't understand.

657
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
抱歉  宝贝
Sorry, babe.

658

为什么
Why?

659
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,740
世道艰难
Times are tough.

660
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,070
我信托基金的额度到了  需要钱
I ran through my trust fund and needed money.

661
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,830
好马有货源
Monty had the product.

662
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,110
我搭上他和保罗一起贩
I hooked him up with Paul to move it,

663
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,650
但是保罗太贪心了
but Paul got greedy.

664
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,900
是你害死了保罗
You had Paul killed.

665
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,730
不是  好马给了保罗一个选择
No, Monty gave Paul a choice--

666
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,940
还我们钱  或者被扔出窗户
give us the money, or go out the window.

667
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,450
好马是不是也给了你一个选择
Did Monty give you a choice?

668
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,880
你  或者我
You or me?

669
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,010
差不多吧
Something like that.

670
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,900
抱歉  宝贝
Sorry, baby.

671
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,660
你是个漂亮的后患
You're just a beautiful loose end.

672
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,390
手机交出来
Give me your phone,

673
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,500
马上

674
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,270
用俄语说
Say it in Russian.

675
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,440
换意大利语
Now Italian.

676
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,090
你把这个给其他人看过吗
Did you send or show this to anyone?

00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,660
很好
Good.

678
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,300
好了  笨蛋  好戏结束了
Okay, bozo, show's over.

679
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,920
快  亲爱的  下车
Come on, darling. Get out of the car.

680
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,110
我先宰了你  一样再抓她
I'm just gonna find her again after I shoot you.

681
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,870
开玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

682
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,450
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

683
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,340
你想什么呢  以为能跑过我吗
What do you think, you're gonna outrun me?

684
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,220
让我琢磨一会儿
Let me mull that over a sec.

685
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,300
没错  我确定能跑过你
Yep, I'm pretty sure I can outrun ya.

686
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,740
谢了  卡特

687
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,050
受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

688
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,620
我没事
I'm fine.

689
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,050
找到杰克了吗
Did you find Jack?

690
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,650
还没有
Not yet.

691
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,360
十一点的航班  飞往开曼岛  对
11:00 flight, to the Caymans, that's right.

692
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,330
天啊
God!

693
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,610
是好马干的  我发誓
Okay, it was Monty. I swear.

694
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,480
他无法无天啊
He's unleashed, okay?

695
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,220
是他要消除后患的  不是我
He was the one who wanted to tie up the loose ends, not me.

696
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,140
保罗本来不用死的
Paul was never even supposed to die.

697
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,220
求你了  你想要什么
Please. What do you want from me?

698
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,360
这是勒索吗
Is this a shakedown?

699
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,480
不  这是分手
No. This is a breakup.

700
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,760
索菲亚  要我把他扔下去吗
Sofia, should I drop him?

701
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,120
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

702
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,100
先别扔
Not yet.

703
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,930
你杀了我唯一的朋友
You killed my only friend.

704
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,470
那不是我的主意  宝贝
That was so not my idea, baby.

705
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,050
就像把我出卖给好马也不是你的主意一样
Just like selling me out to Monty wasn't your idea?

706
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,380
我说了他让我选择
I told you he gave me a choice,

707
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,290
你或者我
you or me.

708
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,080
你有他  我就知道你会没事的
You have him. I knew you'd be okay.

709
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,640
我会没事的
I will be okay.

710
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,130
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? She was made to blow you away ?

711
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,590
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}?She don't care ?

712
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,470
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}?what any man say ?

713
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,990
进去

714
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,990
感觉好舒畅
That was fulfilling.

715

716
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,750
想过你接下来要做什么吗

00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,640
我要跟我父亲回巴西
I will be returning to Brazil with my father

718
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,580
开始竞选
for the election.

719
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,100
我想我没法说服你一起走
Guess I can't talk you into relocating?

720
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,300
纽约是我的家
New York's my home...

721
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,200
目前是
for now.

722
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,210
你把我照顾得很好
You've taken very good care of me.

723
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,800
晚安
Night.

724
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,810
卡特警探  你致电中情局
Detective Carter, did you call the CIA

725
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,120
问过马克・斯诺
regarding Mark Snow?

726
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,870
我打过他的手机  是的
I called his cell, yes.

727
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,720
你和马克・斯诺联系过
You had contact with Mark Snow.

728
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,040
据我所知  监视斯诺的人是你
Last I checked, Snow was yours to keep tabs on,

729
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,930
不是我
not mine.

730
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,590
你跟丢了
You lose him?

731
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,100
我本来要说去找他的搭档伊万斯
I'd say talk to his partner Evans,

732
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,800
不过那家伙五周前死在一家酒店里
except the guy was found dead in a hotel five weeks ago.

733
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,860
我替你做的工作够多了
Think I've done enough of your job for you.

734
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,000
现在  恕我失陪
Now, if you'll excuse me.

735
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,380
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Her eyes?

736
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,350
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? they're rubies and pearls?

737
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,020
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? She's not made?

738
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,530
刚刚去了陈尸房
Dropped by the morgue.

739
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,720
从考文的尸体上取出了点东西
Got something off Corwin's body.

740
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,150
是我们想的吗
Is it what we thought?

741
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,940
初步看了一下
Took a preliminary look at it.

742
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,930
我想我们有大麻烦了
I think we have a big problem.

743
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,710
你还要多久能到
How soon can you get here?

744
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,970
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? She was made to blow you away?

745
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,450
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? She don't care?

746
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,810
考文死了
Corwin's dead.

747
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,840
你对此可没什么发言权  马克
Not sure you're the best judge of that, Mark.

748
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,290
你还认为我也死了呢
I mean, you thought I was dead too.

749
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,020
总得乐观一点吧
Always been a bit of an optimist.

750
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,710
你想知道是谁让她派遣你
You wanna know who told her to send you

751
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,990
和里瑟到中国去
and your pal Reese to China,

752
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,350
你得使劲大声吼问她了
you'll have to ask her really loudly.

753
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,640
可惜
Shame.

754
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,680
看来你要为我多跑几趟了
Guess you'll have to run a few more errands for me.

755
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,020
我告诉你  做我们这行的
I gotta tell ya, our line of work,

756
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,050
会遇上很多心理不正常的人
you meet a lot of disturbed people,

757
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,060
但是你  卡拉
but you, Kara?

758
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,400
你总能自成一派
You were always in a class all by yourself.

759
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,580
小心一点
Be careful.

760
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,560
可别伤害我的感情
Wouldn't wanna hurt my feelings.

761
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,210
也许我会忘记你在这里了
I might forget you down here.

762
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,870
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Her lashes flap ?

763
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,730
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? and they smack men back ?

764
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,460
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? like springs bouncing off of her curls ?

765
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,820
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Oh, yeah ?

766
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,590
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? She's long ?

767
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,040
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? long gone ?

768
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,320
该去喝那杯啤酒了
It's time we went for that beer.

769
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,890
我有事情要处理
