要是有什么我能帮上忙的

我会跟你说的  回头再聊

160
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,410
我知道你不想跟我说话
I know you don't want to talk to me.

161
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,160
-但是舍曼斯基的事  -没什么可说的
- But look, about Szymanski-- - There's nothing to talk about.

162
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,600
除非你准备说出你线人的名字

163
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,700
那人害死了他

164
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,830
-乔丝  -我说过了
- Joss-- - Like I said.

165
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,430
你没事吧

166
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,520
比彻收到的舍曼斯基脏钱的线报

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,410
我证明了那些钱不是他的  舍曼斯基就死了
I prove the money wasn't his, Szymanski turns up dead?

168
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,100
我得知道是不是比彻陷害他  弗斯科
I gotta know if Beecher set him up, Fusco.

169
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,130
-我帮你查查吧  -好的

还没
Not yet.

173
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,920
你还在跟你的目标吗
You keeping track of yours?

174

是的  多亏员工卡里的芯片

我能看到这栋楼里所有员工的位置

发现潜在威胁了吗

177
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,290
到目前为止  只发现了过劳工作和生吃海鲜

178
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,940
雅各布斯女士非常敬业  热忱

技术精湛

你对这号码动心了  是吧  芬奇
You've got a crush on this number, don't you, Finch?

181
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,020
一个人认可同类的品质并不代表就
A human being can recognize qualities in another human being without--

182
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,010
她离开办公室了
She's leaving her office.

183
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,750
奇怪  我跟着她到了科研技术部楼层
It's strange. I followed her to the R&D floor.

184
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,410
她进了电脑库房
She's in the computer storage room.

185
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,100
{\pos(124,137)}贾斯丁・李

为何雅各布斯女士身居高位
Why would someone in Ms. Jacobs's position

200
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,630
还要偷偷摸摸跑来偷取电脑文件
be sneaking around stealing computer files

201
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,660
还要躲着公司的保安人员
and hiding from corporate security?

202
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,830
我知道你喜欢那女人  芬奇
I know you like this woman, Finch.

203
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,300
但是中情局教会了我一件事
But if the agency taught me one thing...

204
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,830
最厉害的间谍
it's that the most effective spy

205
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,180
是不最招人怀疑的
is the one you'd never suspect.

206
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,830
忠诚的信仰者
A true believer.

207
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,910
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

208
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
里瑟先生  你在吗
Mr. Reese, are you there?

209
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,990
稍后打给你  芬奇
I gotta call you back, Finch.

210
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,250
你好啊  肖
Hello, Shaw.

211
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,220
我想你可能会在这里
I thought I just might find you here.

212
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,830
所以你就决定来拜访一下
And you decided to drop in for a visit?

213
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,370
监视很闷啊
Stakeouts can get a little tedious.

214
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,300
你怎么就认为我想要人陪
And what made you think I wanted the company?

215
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,750
因为我曾开枪射你  还是因为我曾把你们丢在公墓
The time I shot you, or the time I ditched you at the cemetery?

216
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,440
我顽强啊
I'm persistent.

217
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,530
也许你是领会不了暗示
Or maybe you just can't take a hint.

218
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,870
达琳・科尔和伊万・科尔
Darlene and Evan Cole.

219
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,700
你前搭档的父母
Your former partner's parents.

220
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,600
死去的搭档
Dead partner.

221
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,720
政府诬陷科尔是本土恐怖分子
The government framed Cole as a domestic terrorist.

222
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,370
我想你可能会回这里
I thought you might come back here

223
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,700
为他洗清罪名
to set the record straight.

224
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,930
你怎么知道的
How'd you figure that?

225
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,640
因为我就会
It's what I'd do.

226
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,030
主控者已经杀了他们的儿子
Control killed their son.

227
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,840
不需要再毁掉他们对儿子的记忆
They didn't need to take their memory of him.

228
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
即使中情局也不会如此恶劣
Even the CIA wouldn't stoop that low.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,300
他们只会把所有见不得光的东西藏起来
They'd just sweep their mess under the rug

230
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,770
然后在墙上挂上他的那颗星
and give him a star on the wall.

231
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,990
你的前雇主因为科尔发现真相而杀了他
Your former employers killed Cole for discovering the truth,

232
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,180
没什么能阻止他们杀他的父母
and nothing's stopping them from killing his parents, too.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,680
但你已经知道了
But you already know this.

234
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
所以你跑到了这里  而没有进去
That's why you're out here and not in there.

235
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,770
下次你想要呼吸新鲜空气
Next time you want some fresh air...

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,040
换个地儿吧
pick a different spot.

237
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,880
有位朋友曾经对我说
A friend once told me,

238
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,360
干我们这一行的
in our line of work,

239
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,970
我们行走在黑暗中
we walk in the dark.

240
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,390
但我们无需一个人行走
Doesn't mean we have to walk in it alone.

241
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,170
我觉得你这问题不像是病毒
Well, I'm not sure the source of your problem is a virus.

242
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,380
而像是
It's more likely...

243
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,190
摩卡咖啡 
Mochachino.

244
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,310
我帮你换个新键盘
I'll try to find you a new keyboard.

245
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,050
谢谢
Thank you.

246
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,160
你偷的到底是什么东西呢
Now what was it you were stealing?

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,260
你在雅各布斯女士的办公室里做什么呢
What are you doing in Ms. Jacobs' office?

248
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,460
安全更新
Security update.

249
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,520
一周前刚刚更新过
We just had an update a week ago.

250
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,590
之后我们又发现了额外的威胁
Well, we've since discovered additional threats to the network

251
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,840
需要再次更新
that needed addressing.

252
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,190
具体是怎样的威胁呢
And what threats might those be, specifically?

253
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,320
一种复杂的内核模式木马
A complex kernel-mode rootkit

254
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,860
通过受感染的小程序来使得安全子系统失效
that disables secure subsystems through compromised applets,

255
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,390
我想就不用我向你解释
and I'm sure I don't need to explain to you

256
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,390
如果不安装更新是何等危险
how dangerous that could be if the update were not installed.

257
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,750
装好了
All set.

258
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,560
不用谢
You're welcome.

259
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,610
你想什么呢
What are you thinking?

260
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,250
纸巾用完了
They ran out of paper towels.

261
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,940
我是说你拒绝透露
I'm talking about you refusing to say

262
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,880
是谁给了你舍曼斯基钱的线报
who gave you the tip on the Szymanski money.

263
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,320
那些钱被联调局做了标记
The bills were marked by the feds.

264
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,950
在对以利亚的一家杂货店进行突袭行动中被发现的
Found in a raid on a bodega that Elias was operating out of.

265
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,820
所以呢
So?

266
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,380
那些钱没被收进证物
Money never made it to evidence.

267
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,420
要么是以利亚的人拿了这钱
So either Elias's boys got a hold of it

268
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,540
要么就是一些黑警干的
or some dirty cops did.

269
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,670
不管怎样  都挺恶心
Either way, it stinks.

270
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,450
你是说跟我有关
You saying I had something to do with it?

271
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,060
我是说舍曼斯基被人陷害了
I'm saying Szymanski got set up.

272
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,320
你一直不肯透露口风  让我觉得你也脱不了干系
And by you keeping quiet, makes me think you were in on it.

273
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,710
知道吗  我有个朋友以前也在
See, I got friends who used to work

274
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,490
你所在的辖区工作  弗斯科

I heard about your crew.

276

两个进了监狱  一个失踪
Two are in jail and one's missing,

277
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,600
你居然还敢说我是黑的
and you're calling me dirty?

278
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,180
我直说了吧
Let me spell it out for you.

279
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,230
-离卡特远点儿  -否则呢
- Stay away from Carter. - Or what?

280
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,070
这是怎么回事  伙计们
What's going on, fellas?

281
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,780
问的好
That's a good question.

282
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,260
这是怎么回事
What is going on?

不了  我有个会议
No, I have a meeting.

290
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,440
日程表上没有啊
I don't have anything scheduled.

291
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,220
是临时通知的
It was a last minute thing.

292
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,840
我就懒得列在日程表上了
I didn't bother putting it on the calendar.

293

-里瑟先生  你在哪儿  -在路上

花商说没有姓李的人
the florist said no one by the name of Lee

308
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,070
住过那里

People move, change their address.

00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,450
我查过了  他的父母从未住在那里过
I checked. The parents never lived there.

311
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,730
不只如此  关于李的所有信息
It's not just that. Everything about Lee,

312
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,310
从联系人信息到工作经历  都是假的
from his contact information to his work history, was a lie.

313
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,820
我认为他是卧底
I think he may have been a plant.

314
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,890
卧底  为谁工作
A plant? For who?

315
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,760
所有的竞争对手都有可能
Could be any of our competitors.

316
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,610
所以我不想在办公室谈这个
That's why I didn't want to have this conversation at the office.

317
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,100
还有这个
And then, there's this.

318
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,370
她刚刚把昨晚那个闪存盘给他了
She just gave him the flash drive that she used last night.

319
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,160
我找到了李的电脑  拷贝了他的文件
I found Lee's computer, made copies of his files

320
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,110
发现了他死亡当天发出的一堆加密邮件
and found a handful of encrypted emails sent the day he died.

321
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,630
我试着打开  但没成功
I tried, but I couldn't open them.

322
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,160
还有谁知道这事儿
Who else knows about this?

323
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,520
只有你
Just you.

324
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,720
既然他在你手下做事
Seeing as he worked in your division,

325
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,170
我认为你会希望先了解一下
I thought you'd want to get out in front of this.

326
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,770
的确  我会去调查的
I do. I'll look into it.

327
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
然后我们一起告诉老头子  好吗
Then we can tell the old man together, okay?

328
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,750
莫妮卡
And, Monica...

329
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,840
谢谢你

我得看到那盘上的邮件
I need to see the emails on that drive.

331
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,230
我得找个借口进入他的办公室
I'll have to contrive a reason to get into his office.

332
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,640
我有更好的主意

333

感谢你能来见我  奎恩先生
Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Quinn.

337
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,170
肩膀好点了吗
How's the shoulder?

338
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,330
慢慢康复了
It's getting stronger day by day.

339
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,380
你电话上听起来很担忧
You sounded concerned on the phone.

340
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,480
舍曼斯基一案引发了诸多疑问
There's been some questions about the Szymanski investigation.

341
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,070
比如  我从哪里得来那些钱的消息
Like, who my source was about the money.

342
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,960
-你怎么说  -没说
- And you said? - Nothing.

343
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,150
你让我不说出你的名字  我照做了
You asked me to keep your name out of it, and I have.

344
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,310
问题是  我自己也想知道
Thing is, uh, I've been wondering myself.

345
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,370
那条线报是从哪里来的
Where did that tip come from?

346
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,030
线报很可靠  有什么关系
Well, the tip was strong. Why does it matter?

347
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,630
关乎一名殉职警探的荣誉
A dead detective's reputation is on the line.

348
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,310
就有关系
It matters.

349
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,740
卡尔  在我这个职位
Cal, in my position

350
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,270
会不断收到很多消息
I'm constantly being offered information.

351
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,210
人们愿意告诉我
And the reason people come to me

352
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,920
是因为他们相信我会保密
is they know I will keep their confidence.

353
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
好吧
Right.

354
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,680
线报来自以利亚手下的一名喽
The tip came from one of Elias's soldiers.

355
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,000
以利亚在坐牢  他的手下日子不好过
Since Elias has been in prison, his men have struggled.

356
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,410
这家伙不爽看着舍曼斯基拿着钱
This guy was just tired of seeing Szymanski getting paid

357
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,050
而自己入不敷出
while he scraped by.

358
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,680
我可以把那条消息告诉任何人
Now, I could have given that information to anybody,

359
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,840
但我想让我的教子领功
but I wanted my godson to get the credit for it.

360
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,020
我认为质疑你的人是想自己抢功
I imagine whoever's questioned you wish they had made the bust.

361
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,870
别为他们心烦
Don't let them rattle you.

362
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,240
没事了吧
We good?

363
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,280
是的
Yeah.

364
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,300
谢了  奎恩先生

他会是个麻烦吗
He gonna be a problem?

367
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,610
希望不会
Let's hope not.

368
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,600
这么说莫妮卡不是间谍
So Monica wasn't spying.

369
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
她是在追捕间谍
She was hunting a spy.

370
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,310
也就是说威胁可能来源于
Which means the threat may be coming from

371
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,920
李为之工作的人
whoever Lee was spying for.

372
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,910
我已经让卡特警探调查他的死亡
I've asked Detective Carter to look into his death.

373
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,570
雅各布斯女士的手机好像在同步
Ms. Jacobs's phone seems to be syncing.

374
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,180
不是她本人做的
She's not doing it.

375
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,180
-那是谁  -好问题
- Then who is? - Good question.

376
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,690
他们正在添加捏造的联系人  预约提醒  通话记录
They're adding contacts, appointments, phone calls she never made.

377
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,560
里瑟先生  大事不妙了
Mr. Reese, something's terribly wrong.

378
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,680
不好意思  这是我的办公室
Excuse me, this is my office.

379
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,980
请你在这等着
You'll need to wait here, please.

380
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,060
这是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

381
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,110
我也想问你同样的问题  莫妮卡
I'd ask you the same question, Monica.

382
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,680
但从现在的情形看  答案清晰明了
But by the looks of it, the answer's pretty clear.

383
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,280
保安在你的电脑上发现机密设计文件
Security found confidential designs and documents on your computer.

384
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
罗斯  我跟你说过文件是李的
Ross, I told you those files were from Lee.

385
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,690
那你为什么把它们加到附件中
Then why were they attached to emails

386
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,010
准备发给我们的主要竞争对手呢
you were preparing to send to our main competitors?

387
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,810
通话记录  会议议程
Phone calls, meetings.

388
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,260

什么
What?

390
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,500
李不是间谍  你才是
Lee wasn't the spy. You were.

391
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,480
这不可能  杰罗姆知道我的日程安排
That's impossible. Jerome knows my schedule.

392
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,020
我应该早跟您说的  哈斯凯尔先生
I should have said something, Mr. Haskell.

393
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,360
她这段时间有些怪异
She's been acting strangely for a while now,

394
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,550
自己定日程表
keeping her own schedule,

395
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,800
修改预约计划
making off the book appointments.

396
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,890
杰罗姆
Jerome!

397
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,920
抱歉  莫妮卡

我不知道你要我说什么
I don't know what you want me to say.

399
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,490
-马丁  听我说  -莫妮卡  拜托

马丁  我为你工作了十年

我什么都没偷  请让我解释
I wasn't stealing anything. If you just let me explain...

雅各布斯女士刚被雷拉科技解雇了
Ms. Jacobs has just been terminated from Rylatech.

409
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,650
看来有人想要让她闭嘴
Someone may be trying to silence her.

410
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,910
恐怕他们想要让她
I'm afraid they won't stop until they've done so...

411
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,970
永远闭嘴
Permanently.

412
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,960

414
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,500
有
Yes.

415
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,940
她在喝咖啡
She's having coffee,

416
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,430
就在雷拉科技的门口
right in front of Rylatech.

417
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,520
直觉告诉我
Something tells me

418
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,540
她不会甘心就这么被解雇
she's not taking her termination lying down.

419
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,410
我已经看过所有
I've gone over everything

420
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,120
雅各布斯女士所掌握的贾斯丁・李的信息
that Ms. Jacobs collected on Justin Lee,

421
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,080
{\pos(208,171)}麻省理工  工程师硕士学位

422
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,080
{\pos(293,47)}纽约州驾驶证

423
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,730
那名她正在查的疑似间谍
the potential spy she was looking into,

424
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,030
她是对的
and she was right.

425
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,930
李的伪装极为出色
Lee's been operating under a remarkably deep cover.

426
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,710
他麻省理工的学位

427

毕业证书上的印章都是旧的

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,510
还有新泽西的出生证明  医疗记录
His New Jersey birth certificate, medical history.

429
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,700
伪造这一切的人
Whoever set this up--

430
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,750
非常专业
they're pros.

431
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,160
所以他们一发现她盯上他们后
That's how they were able to frame her so quickly

432
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,770
就能迅速陷害她
when they discovered she was on to them.

433
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,520
问题是  谁陷害的
The question is, who did the framing?

434
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,970
如果我能解密他的邮件  或许能有发现
If I could decrypt his emails, they might tell us.

435
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,930
她在跟踪她的助手  芬奇
She's tailing her assistant, Finch.

436
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,710
希望你没指望我下棋
Hope you don't expect me to play.

437
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,150
无意冒犯  警探  但我的对手
No offense, Detective, but my opponent is someone

438
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,250
得有更多的筹码
who brings a little more to the table,

439
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,970
而你却让我兴致寥寥
and you're breaking my concentration.

440
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,840
{\pos(162,203)}已配对手机
卡尔・比彻

441
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,040
那我直说吧
I'll cut to it, then.

442
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,760
有名警探叫舍曼斯基
Detective named Szymanski.

443
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,150
有组织犯罪科的
Organized crime.

444
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,710
他是你的人吗
Was he on your payroll?

445
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,940
恐怕你走错棋了  警探
Afraid you made a bad move, Detective.

446
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,230
我只想要答案
Just trying to get some answers.

447
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,800
那就问聪明点的问题
Then start asking better questions.

448
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,780
舍曼斯基被捕遭谋杀  谁获益最大
Who benefits from Szymanski's arrest and murder?

449
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,130
此人出手怎么做到未被怀疑呢
How could one arrange these acts without being suspected?

450
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,480
谁在隐身幕后
And who's at the center of the strings

451
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
悄悄操纵一切呢
that were quietly pulled?

452
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,820
我想你知道一些你不知道自己知道的事
See, I think you know something you don't even know you know,

453
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,140
也就是说  你在跟自己下棋  警探
which means you're playing a chess game of your own, Detective.

454
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,740
只是你还没意识到
You just don't realize it yet.

455
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,140
你给过舍曼斯基钱吗
Did you give money to Szymanski?

456
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,410
当然
Absolutely...

457
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,200
他把钱摔回了我们脸上
and he threw it in our faces.

458
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,200
他是清白的  你被HR耍了
He was clean, and you got played by HR.

459

卡特警探
Detective Carter,

464
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,760
你查过李的死亡案了吗
have you had a chance to look into Lee's death?

465
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,130
我就是要说这事

我决定提取尸体上的指纹

470
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,960
看系统里面有没有记录
see what popped in the system.

471
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,410
指纹查到线索了吗
Did the prints tell you anything?

472
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
拿不到指纹  尸体消失了
Couldn't get them. The body's gone.

473

什么
What?

474
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,320
已经在停尸间找了45分钟
Searched that morgue for 45 minutes.

475

有人溜了进去  偷走了你们要查的人  李

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,440
看起来你和他的谈话没起到作用
Looks like your talk with him didn't do the trick.

482
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,550
真是遗憾
That's a damn shame.

483
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,820
我们可以把他调出去
We could promote him out of town.

485
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,300

李不是商业间谍

否则何必给我电话号码
Why else would you have given me your number?

517
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,810
我想着你会打电话过来
I guess I imagined that you would just call,

518
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,550

but I suppose this works too.

I'm quite confident, Ms. Shaw,

533

你是第一个这么说我的人

另外  你也没拿武器

他揭露了一个本土恐怖组织阴谋

当然了  中情局永远是既不承认  也不否认
Now, the agency would neither deny or confirm this, of course,

541
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,170

先想办法对付想要杀你的人
until we've dealt with whomever it is that's trying to kill you.

增加了FTP文件传输协议权限和SNMP简单网络管理协议权限
Added for access to the FTP and SNMP.

你们两个要是想独处
If you two would rather be alone...

612
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,290
我把公司的系统建得无法被侵入
I made it virtually impossible to hack into our company,

613
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,520
而现在我却在要侵入
and now here I am doing just that.

614
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,370
整整十年
Ten years of my life.

615
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,030
熬夜加班  周末加班
Nights, weekends.

616
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,130
你知道我拒绝了多少邀请吗
You know how many offers I turned away?

617
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,650
现在这么忠诚的人很稀有了
That's a rare kind of loyalty these days.

618
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,270
事实是  我从没想过到别处工作
Truth is, I never wanted to work anywhere else.

619
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,450
那些人不仅仅是同事  还是我的家人
Those people aren't just co-workers, they're my family.

620
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,360
而现在他们都认为我背叛了他们
And now they think I've betrayed them.

621

马丁当时的表情

你虽然落了下风  莫妮卡  但并未出局
You may be down, Monica, but you're not out.

623
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,440
还没有
Not yet.

624
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,980
只要我能通过服务器的防火墙
If I can get past this server firewall,

625
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,440
我们就能找出
we should be able to locate the hidden network

633
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,930
怎么回事
What happened?

634
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,900
他们禁用了控制电池充电器的
They disabled the micro controller that regulates

635
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,210
微控制器
the battery's charge.

636
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,400
一定有间谍在监控网络
Spies must be monitoring the network.

637
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,410
那现在怎么办
So what now?

638
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,080
如果无法通过防火墙  我也不知道了
If I can't get through the firewall? I'm not sure.

639
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,130
那同时绕过所有防火墙
What about bypassing it all together

640
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,900
直接访问服务器怎么样
and directly accessing the servers?

641
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,110
那我们得进到雷拉科技内部
That would require going back inside Rylatech.

642
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,700
-我可以指路  -太冒险了
- I could show you where to go. - It's too risky.

643
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,680
大楼里的每个人都认识你
Everyone in that building knows your face.

644
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,030
雅各布斯女士  员工卡你还留着吗

像我们这种公司
And companies like ours,

只有不断展望未来
we have to constantly look forward to the future

当然  他把钱摔回了我们脸上
Absolutely, and he threw it in our faces.

也就是说这跟他无关  卡特
It means he wasn't in on it, Carter.

766
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,730
HR里的人利用了他
And that someone in HR used him.

767
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,130
我们得把这个发给内务部
We need to get this to IAB so they can--

768
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,700
内务部
IAB?

769
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,120
这可不是法庭授权的窃听
Not like this was a court-approved wiretap.

770
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,270
你想知道比彻的事  现在你知道了

771
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,170

卡特  比彻正在穿越雷区

他随身带着
He's carrying,

777
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,360
但不见兔子不撒鹰啊
but he won't talk to me unless he sees I'm fit to buy.

778
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,130
好的  交易结束时  我会进行突袭
All right, when the deal's done, I'll make the bust.

779

顺利的话  你拿一半
If it goes right, you can keep half.

780
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,410
-比彻  -你在忙吗

781
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,110
在工作
On a job.

782

我们谈谈
We need to talk.

784
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,970

再说  我们还有件事要谈谈

其余的被传送到另一个组织处

不管德西玛是谁  我相信他们制造病毒

是为了寻找并感染唯一的目标

853
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,200
都集中于中国  而非我们

854
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,880
一个小问题

855
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,770
破解我们加密网络的似乎是

00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,000

我们更大的行动

当然  如期进行中

861
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,260
设备渗透

862

信号编码
