65
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,760
皮尔斯加以完善

他的网站有近十亿用户

皮尔斯是"友网"的首席工程师和负责人

That's right.

72

对奥美来说  要是皮尔斯现在死了
It would certainly not be in Ogilvy's best interest

73
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,370

74
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,850
72小时后"友网"就要上市了

我们得监听皮尔斯  我没法克隆他的手机
We need ears on Pierce. I couldn't clone his phone.

76

就算克隆了也没用
Wouldn't matter if you could.

77

皮尔斯一天换两部手机

我想你应该会系吧
And I assume you know how to tie one of these?

87
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,230
你还在跟那个匿名线索啊
You following up on the anonymous tip?

88
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,190
是的
Yeah.

89
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,200
你真认为是警察杀了戴维森吗
You really think a cop killed Davidson?

90
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,860
我认为很多警察
I think a lot of cops have reason

91
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,890
都恨不得内务部警探去死
to want an IAB detective dead.

92
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,660

97
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,530
两名警察失踪  尸体从未被发现
Two cops go missing, their bodies never found.

98
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,820
这事儿不对劲
Something's not right.

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,300

你所谓的"若干诉讼"到底有多少
What exactly did you mean by "several lawsuits"?

105
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,560
200个  不过我已经排好序了

我  感觉格格不入

119
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,220

我在她宿舍打电话给贾斯汀

没错  也不打招呼  也不说早上好  上来就说
Yeah, no hello, no good morning, just,

124
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,750
贾斯汀  我好像被个妞儿在床上暴打了
"Justin, I think I got beat up by a girl in bed and..."

125
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,330
没错
I did.

126
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,120
我好像还挺享受的
"I think I kind of enjoyed it."

127
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,750

干嘛不用约翰・鲁尼  资产经理人

不不  他只是个百万富翁

约翰・威利身价要过亿

他们的社交网站"连网"

142
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,770
自从"友网"开始后贬值近一半
was devalued by half when Friendczar debuted.

143
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,850
卡盟假装友好

144
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,560
芬奇  皮尔斯注意到我了
Finch, I think Pierce just made me.

145
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,890
先聊一下附带权益漏洞

看来我给他的第一印象不佳
I didn't make a good first impression.

157
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,540
那是因为我没意识到
Only because I didn't realize

158
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,130
我们这位顶级富豪

我们改变了  但世界却还是一样
We changed, but the world stayed the same...

253
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,000
直到今天
until today.

254
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,440
我们不改变世界
If we don't change the world,

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,480
其他人就来改变
someone else will, so...

256
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,800
我们如何才能阻止这种人呢
what are we gonna do to stop the guys who did this?

257
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,730
芬奇  这位亿万富豪
Finch, looks like our billionaire

258
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,440
似乎精神崩溃了
might be having a breakdown.

259
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,590
皮尔斯看起来比
Pierce appears to be even more erratic

260
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,700

264
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,610
-你在哪儿  -我在上班

265
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,400

看来您没干净西装穿了

271
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,480
是啊
Yeah.

272
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,540
我其实比较习惯牛仔T恤
I'm actually more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of guy.

273
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,090
只有这一套西装
I only have one suit.

274
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,210
好西装就像好女人
A good suit is like the perfect woman.

275
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,940
一旦找到对的
Once you find the right one...

里瑟先生  我将皮尔斯的钛卡

281
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,640
换成了带窃听器的卡
for one with a listening device.

282
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,090
我还黑入了他的在线日程表
I also hacked his online calendar.

283
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,470
他要回办公室参加
He'll be heading back to the office

284
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,380
一堆"友网"的诉讼取证会
for a round of Friendczar depositions.

285
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,900
"友网"摧毁了我的生意

286
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,670
毁了我的声誉
They ruined my reputation.

287
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,750
没有人回我的电话

288
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,540
我也无法募集到任何风投资金
And I can forget raising any venture capital funds.

289
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,560
"友网"出手狠绝地买断
Friendczar is aggressive about purchasing

290
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,360
吞并刚起步的小公司
and absorbing small start-ups.

291
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,380
如果任何小公司的首席执行官敢跟他们宣战
And if a small CEO tries to go toe-to-toe with them,

292
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,200
就会面临专利侵权起诉
he gets sued for patent infringement,

293
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,160
无论这诉讼多荒唐
no matter how bogus the suit.

294
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,540
你能告诉我为什么罗根・皮尔斯
Could you tell me why Logan Pierce

295
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,650
都不正眼看他正在起诉的人吗
can't even look the man he's suing in the eye?

296
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,580
因为他睡着了
'Cause he's asleep.

297
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,510
你没有侵犯我们的专利  我们搞错了
You didn't violate our patents, we screwed up.

298
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,390
我们会帮你募集你之前损失的风投资金
We'll help you raise the venture capital funds you lost.

299
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,880
谢谢

300
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,130
下一个是谁
Who's next?

301
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,370
艾米莉・莫顿的律师来了
Emily Morton's lawyers are here.

302
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,500
好极了
Great.

303
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,810
据卡特警探所说
According to Detective Carter,

304
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,580
莫顿小姐将她的婚介网站卖给了"友网"
Ms. Morton sold Friendczar her matchmaking site,

305
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,030
金爱网
Alchementary.Com.

306
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,290
他们答应过会将她的网站推广到全世界
They promised her they'd launch her site worldwide,

307
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,450
但实际上  他们却让这个网站从此不见天日
and instead, they made sure it never saw the light of day.

308
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,170
我只看到了律师却没看到委托人
I see lawyers but no client.

309
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,320
我们的委托人因法定合理原因无法出席
Our client is unable to appear due to extenuating circumstances.

310
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,360
这么个小案子用不上"法定合理原因"条款
A frivolous lawsuit doesn't qualify as extenuating circumstances.

311
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,090
但有恐吓就可以
But intimidation does.

312
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,830
我们下午一点有董事会会议

让董事会来科尼岛见我

那儿有培根热狗

315
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,070
外层酥脆  里层多汁
Crispy on the outside, juicy on the in.

316
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,790
这可是你们犹太人的噩梦啊
It's your basic kosher nightmare.

317
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,000
但你知道俗话怎么说的
But you know what they say,

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,510
"在科尼岛发生的"
"What happens on Coney Island--"

319
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,450
我看在科尼岛也发生不了什么事
Well, I guess nothing good really happens on Coney Island,

320
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,850
除了热狗
except for these dogs.

321
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,750
神经病
What a lunatic.

322
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,460
如果再联系不上莫顿女士

我们就只能撤销起诉了

芬奇  艾米莉失踪了
Finch, Emily's missing,

325
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,550
她的律师暗示她被恐吓了

326
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,600
正好在庭审开始之前
Right before her suit goes to trial.

327
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,550
时机还真是巧啊
The timing is a little too perfect.

328
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,970
也许皮尔斯及其搭档
Maybe Pierce and his partner

329
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,850
跟其失踪有关
had something to do with her disappearance.

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,930

还有两天就首次公开募股了
Two days before your company's IPO,

332
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,330
你给我在特里贝克区裸奔

333
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,140
告诉我  辛克莱
Tell me, Sinclair,

334
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,610
你的衬衫买来时就这么挺
do you buy all your shirts pre-stuffed,

335
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,300
还是你给硬撑起来的
or do you just fill 'em out that way?

336
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,770
过来
Come here.

337
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,840
让你的搭档按游戏规则来
Get your partner back in the game,

338
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,800
不然我就召集紧急董事会

339
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,940
你要能用LAMP建个靠谱儿的网站出来  梅尔本
When you build a viable web server using the LAMP stack, Sinclair,

340
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,880

341
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,880
公司就归你管
you're free to run the company.

342
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,060
实际上  你觉得董事会怎么选
In fact, let's put it before the board--

343
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,210
要你还是要我
You or me.

344
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,740
我看也是
That's what I thought.

345

不太对
Something's not right.

352

皮尔斯开车通常很快
Normally Pierce drives fast,

353

361
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,550
然后控制引擎
then access the engine control unit.

看得见  再有10秒钟

之前那辆车毫发未损
Why get the exact same car

451
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,790
为什么又买辆一模一样的

452
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,610
因为这是无与伦比的

Single Malt Scotch, neat, right?

462
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,620
拍卖会上你就喝的这个
That's what you had at the auction.

463
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,640
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

464
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,080
不过真令人赞叹
That's impressive though.

465
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,970
了解人是我的工作
Knowing people is my business.

466
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,230
我以为你的工作是
I thought your business was

467
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,670
为了首次公开募股陪投资人侃大山
schmoozing investors for your IPO.

468
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,230
虽然我的手表没精确到纳秒
My watch might not be able to tell time to the nanosecond,

469
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,140
不过你肯定迟到了
but you're late.

470
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,870
我有更好的事要做
I have better things to do.

471
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,710
芬奇  皮尔斯不去自己的派对了
Finch, Pierce is missing his own party.

472
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,840
正好
Just as well.

473
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,090
皮尔斯在公众场合更不安全
Pierce won't be safe in public now.

474
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,470
查下你的手机
Check your phone.

475
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,340
"友网"的首次公开募股即将
Friendczar's IPO is predicted

476
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,040
达到历史纪录
to reach record-breaking numbers.

477
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,580
你觉得自己会创造历史吗
Do you think you'll make history?

478
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,660
股票估值过高  没理由不会啊
Well, with stock this overvalued, how could we not?

479
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,250
私底下说  珍妮特  要我就多等个
You know, personally, Janet, I'd wait to buy

480
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,450
一两天  等股价下跌后再买
for at least a day or two till after the stock dips.

481
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,620
你懂我意思吧
You know what I mean?

482
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,560
董事会召开了紧急会议
The board called an emergency meeting.

483
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,790
皮尔斯已经不是"友网"的首席执行官了
Pierce is no longer CEO of Friendczar.

484
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,750
谁死了
Who died?

485
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,190
上帝  不是我吧
Oh, God. Don't tell me it was me.

486
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,420
看来董事会认为他们可以取代你
The board thinks they can do your job after all.

487
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,280
你出局了
You're out.

488
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,110
敬失业
Well, here's to unemployment.

489
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,290
我感觉不太对
I don't feel very good.

490
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,760
皮尔斯
Pierce?

491
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,690
皮尔斯
Pierce.

492
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,290
放松  放松  放松
Sit back, sit back, sit back.

493
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,280
这是过敏反应
You're having a reaction.

494
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,040
你对什么过敏
Are you allergic to anything?

495
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,290
萘普生
Naproxen.

496
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,030
里瑟先生  怎么了
Mr. Reese, what's going on?

497
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,400
威士忌  被动了手脚
The scotch, it was spiked.

498
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,670
皮尔斯快要过敏性休克了
Pierce is going into anaphylactic shock.

499
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,630
-这就派救护车  -来不及了
- Sending an ambulance. - There's no time.

500
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,370
我得让空气进入他肺里
I need to get air into his lungs.

501
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,700
放松
Relax.

502
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,410
看着我  你会没事的
Look at me. You're going to be okay.

503
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,380
皮尔斯没事吧  里瑟先生
Is Pierce all right, Mr. Reese?

504
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,430
没事
Yes.

505
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,950
不过他要宿醉惨了
But he's gonna have one hell of a hangover.

506
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,950
你救了我
You saved me.

507
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,800
按中国文化
In the Chinese culture,

508
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,680
你要负责我一辈子
you'd be responsible for me for life.

509
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,770
真高兴我们都不是中国人
Glad neither one of us is Chinese then.

510
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,930
谁有权限进到你家
Who has access to your house?

511
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,140
就我一百多名挚友
Just a hundred or so of my closest friends.

512
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,360
我喜欢人群
I like people.

513
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,270
我喜欢派对
I like to party.

514
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,380
谁知道你对萘普生过敏
Who knows you're allergic to naproxen?

515
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,990
我不知道  我也是最近才过敏的
I don't know, I didn't develop the allergy till recently.

516
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,270
你为什么做这些
Why are you doing this?

517
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,910
有人安排你来的吗
Did somebody put you up to this?

518
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,280
是在为某些黑暗可怕的错误在赎罪吗
Is this penance for some deep, dark mistake?

519
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,730
听上去你颇有同感
Spoken like a man who's made his fair share.

520
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,220
我  我对错误不感兴趣
I-- mistakes don't interest me.

521
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,170
我从不回顾过去  只会继续前行
I don't look back. You keep moving.

522
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,110
这是唯一的存活之道
It's the only way to stay alive.

523
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,470
这理论颇有道理
Philosophy makes sense,

524
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,620
尤其是从一个父母破产的孩子嘴里说出来
coming from a kid whose parents went bankrupt.

525
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,500
了解人也是我的工作
Knowing people is my business too.

526
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,160
我父亲有一家小相机店
My dad owned a little camera shop.

527
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,220
他主要靠冲洗胶卷来赚钱
And, he made most of his money developing film.

528
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,960
他一直坚持做这行
And he insisted on staying the course,

529
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,100
直到有一天发现胶卷已经绝迹了
all the way until the point that film became extinct.

530
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,050
他想转去卖数码相机
And then he tried to sell digital cameras,

531
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,110
不过当时已经晚了
but by then it was too late

532
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,850
因为大家已经开始用手机照相了
because everyone had one in their phone.

533
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,690
他想都没想过会那样
It's like he didn't even see it coming.

534
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,370
失意失败后  我们失去了一切
When the business failed, we lost everything.

535
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,530
你觉得你这样下去的话
And you think if you're constantly evolving,

536
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,040
就不会重蹈覆辙吗
this won't happen to you?

537
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,080
当然会
Of course it'll happen.

538
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,010
但只要能接受改变的必然
But if you accept change is inevitable,

539
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,780
到时就不会被打垮了
it doesn't crush you when it does.

540
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,150
在技术时代  约翰
Every technology ages, John.

541
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,370
唯一不会过时的
the only thing that never gets old

542
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,300
就是和其他人的羁绊
is connecting with people.

543
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,420
那是每个人的向往
That's what everyone wants,

544
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,070
真正的羁绊
a real connection.

545
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,230
你恐怕得考虑
Well, you might wanna consider

546
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,220
失去上百挚友了
losing a couple hundred of your closest friends.

547
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,920
我觉得你今晚应该够刺激了
I think you've had enough excitement for one night.

548
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,350
我闭会眼
I'm gonna rest my eyes

549
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,690
让你也休息下
and give you a break.

550
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,090
我把那亿万富豪哄睡了  芬奇
I've put the billionaire to bed, Finch.

551
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,290
我们得见个面
We need to meet.

552
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,070
适宜散步的美好夜晚
Nice night for a walk.

553
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,890
怎么没带小熊来
Why didn't you bring Bear?

554
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,370
小熊不想出来
Bear didn't wanna come.

555
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,170
书上说如果家里气氛焦虑
I read that if there's anxiety in the home,

556
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,880
宠物也会跟着沮丧
it can make your pets become upset.

557
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,670
你有什么过大的压力吗
Have you been under any excess stress?

558
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,480
你是说除了被关在里克岛监狱12平米的小屋里
You mean besides being locked in an 11x13 in Rikers

559
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,740
和穿着炸弹背心在曼哈顿闲晃之外吗
and wearing a bomb vest around Manhattan?

560
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,070
没什么了
Not really.

561
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,160
给皮尔斯投毒的人能进入他家
Whoever poisoned Pierce had access to his home.

562
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,990
我们得让他搬走
We need to move him.

563
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,980
我也这么想
My thinking exactly.

564
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,660
我会让卡特警探
I'll have Detective Carter

565
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,790
检查酒瓶上的指纹
examine the decanter for prints.

566
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,370
你把那位朋友送到安全屋去
You can escort our friend to the safe house.

567
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,200
该叫那亿万富豪起床了
Time to wake the billionaire.

568
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,290
我醒了
I'm awake.

569
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,000
你是谁
And just who are you?

570
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,890
不想告诉我你是谁吗
You don't wanna tell me who you are?

571
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,140
没关系  我已经知道了
That's okay. I already know.

572
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,670
告诉我  你怎么能做出这么小的窃听器
Tell me, how did you make a bug small enough

573
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,100
装进这里呢
to fit inside this?

574
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,620
还有你的声音
Your voice too.

575
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,490
你黑进了我的车载电脑系统
You hacked into my car's computer

576
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,630
远程接入了加速和刹车系统
and you remotely accessed the accelerator and the brakes.

577
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,600
所以我猜你是动脑子的那个
So I guess that makes you the brains of the operation.

578
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,560
无意冒犯
No offense.

579
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,510
从你的定制西装看来
And judging by your bespoke suit,

580
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,110
你还是金主
you're also the bank.

581
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,800
而你  约翰
And there's you, John.

582
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,570
你搞定了我的保镖泽维
You took out my security guard Zvi.

583
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
他是前摩萨德特工  还是近身格斗高手
He's a former Mossad agent and an expert in krav maga.

584
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,860
那你是干什么的  约翰
So what is it, John?

585
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,190
前特种兵  前中情局特工
Former special ops? Ex-CIA?

586
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
至于你  超级有钱的黑客吗
And you, just a very rich hacker?

587
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,190
就你而言  皮尔斯先生
As far as you're concerned, Mr. Pierce,

588
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,180
我们并不存在
we don't exist.

589
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,660
这才是最令人赞叹的地方
But that's what's most impressive.

590
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,140
约翰  我查过你
John, I've been looking into you.

591
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,140
我说的不是你那对冲基金经理的掩护身份
And I'm not talking about your bogus hedge fund cover.

592
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,320
你和你的搭档似乎没有留下
You and your partner here don't seem

593
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,270
任何网络数据资料
to have a digital footprint.

594
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,630
所以我就问自己
So I have to ask myself,

595
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,820
这种信息时代怎么可能呢
how is this possible in this information age?

596
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,750
能如此隐姓埋名的人
People with that kind of anonymity,

597
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,670
拥有真正的力量
that's true power.

598
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,310
所以你看  我知道你们是谁
So you see, I know who you are.

599
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,110
我唯一不知道的是
The only thing I don't know

600
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,510
你们为什么做这个
is why you do what you do.

601
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,870
我提醒你一下  皮尔斯先生
Let me remind you, Mr. Pierce,

602
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,710
我们救了你两次
that we saved your life twice.

603
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,210
你现在是想继续插手我们的事
Now, you wanna keep on butting into our affairs?

604
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,570
还是想保住小命
Or do you want to live?

605
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,100
用不着激动嘛
No need to get testy.

606
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,680
我只是随便聊聊
I was just making small talk.

607
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,000
有什么计划
So what's the plan?

608
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,080
恐怕你现在谁也不能相信
I'm afraid that you can't trust anyone.

609
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,120
我们要带你去附近的安全屋
We've arranged to take you to a safe house nearby.

610
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,040
你们不希望有人找到我
You don't want anyone to find me,

611
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,580
却让我待在城里吗
but you're keeping me in the city?

612
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,780
你有更好的选择吗
You know a better place?

613
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,310

我可能跟一两个人提过我们的小旅行

00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,100
她甚至让我想起了你
You know, she actually reminds me of you,

767
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,600
以前的你
how you used to be--

768
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,230
有热情  有原则
passionate, principled.

769
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,570
你还没有决心欺负
Before you decided we need to bully

770
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,250
和毁灭所有竞争对手之前
and bury our competition.

771
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,690
我没听到你反对
I didn't hear you objecting.

772
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,300
那是因为你没有好好听
That's 'cause you weren't listening to me.

773
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,490
我告诉过你多少次
How many times did I tell you

774
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,240
我不想用那种方式做生意
I don't wanna run a business like that?

775
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,570
你根本就不想做生意
You didn't wanna run a business at all,

776
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,970
所有的事都是我在做
left me to do everything.

777
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,310
我开始还以为你是失去理智了
I thought maybe you'd gone off the deep end,

778
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,950
才在城里半裸着晃荡
parading around town half-naked,

779
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,360
去科尼岛开董事会议
taking board meetings at Coney Island.

780
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,990
然后我意识到了
Then I realized,

781
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,900
如果董事会开除了你
if the board pushed you out,

782
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,100
你的竞业禁止条款就作废了
your non-compete clause would be null and void,

783
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,530
你就可以发布艾米莉的技术
and you could take Emily's technology public.

784
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,890
艾米莉的创意更好
Emily's idea's better.

785
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,220
那才是人们想要的  能完美匹配
It's what people want, the perfect match

786
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,690
爱情  友情  甚至商业伙伴
in love and friendship, even business.

787
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,840
你懂什么叫友情吗
What do you know about friends?

788
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,210
你所有的朋友都想让你死
All your friends want you dead.

789
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,660
连你新朋友都抛弃你了
Even your new pal's left you.

790
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,160
把他扔下去
Dump him.

791
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,380
不  不
No, no!

792
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,510
不  等等
No! Wait, wait!

793
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,790
等等
Wait!

794
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,550
这正是我设计好的  知道吧
I had 'em right where I wanted 'em, you know?

795
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,170
你得交点新朋友了  皮尔斯

罪名是试图加害其合伙人罗根・皮尔斯
for attempting to murder his partner Logan Pierce

808
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,020
该案案情奇怪
in what can only be described as a bizarre case.

809
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,140
有些友情注定难以持久
