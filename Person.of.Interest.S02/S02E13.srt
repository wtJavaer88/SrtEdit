他肯定亟需我们的帮助

你们是黑警
You guys dirty cops?

188
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,840
联邦探员

你们老板  她肯定背景很深

我相信你已经收过钱了

我相信你们听到我的要价了

201

去拿硬盘  然后走人 
Now get the drive and get moving.

207
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,460

你让我杀了我的搭档吗

发现你没加入我们小小的东方之旅

这次的工作必须由两个人完成
This one's strictly a two-man job and for good reason.

222
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,220
最近几个月  我们发现

223
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,250

231
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,470
他们告诉我你已经叛变了
They told me you'd been compromised.

232
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,180
我接到了相同的命令

235
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,920
我在哪里
Where am I?

236

这是另一个世界  亲爱的
You're in the afterlife, my dear.

237
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,330
我不会开口的
I won't talk.

238
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,200
我也不想你开口
I wouldn't want you to.

239
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,210
你需要休息

240

而且  我知道你的名字  斯坦顿女士

事实上  我知道关于你的一切

242
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,640
你来自哪里  为谁工作
Where you're from, who you work for.

243
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,980
你如何沦落至此
How you ended up in that bed.

244
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,450
我玩的是情报
Information is my business.

245
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,750
这是你的政府派你找的东西
This is what your government sent you to find.

246
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
他们迫切想要毁掉的东西
Something they were so eager to destroy

247
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,540
甚至不惜连你也一起杀掉
that they were willing to kill you too.

248
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,820
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what it is?

249
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,160
答案  可以解答一个非常有趣的问题
An answer to a very interesting question.

250
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,080
想知道这个问题是什么吗
Would you like to know what that question is?

251
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,320
我不关心
I don't care.

252
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,490
你不关心  是吧
No, you don't, do you?

253
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,860
所以你我会相处愉快的
That's why you and I are gonna get along.

254
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,940
你应该吃点东西  约翰
You should eat something, John.

255
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,510
过了这村就没这店了
You may not get another chance.

256
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,700
我不太有食欲
I don't have that much of an appetite.

257
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,450
马克一开始也是这样
Mark was like you at first.

258
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,290
我半死不活在东胜一家医院醒来时也是这样
So was I when I woke up half-dead in a hospital in Dongsheng.

259
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,170
无法掌控身边的一切
You can't control anything around you.

260
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,640
就只能用最微不足道的法子反击
So you fight back in whatever little ways you can.

261
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,940
比如说绝食
Like refusing to eat.

262
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,260
但最终  会接受命运
But in time, you accept your fate

263
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,310
就像这位马克
like Mark here...

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,260
吃个汉堡
and have a hamburger.

265
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,040
我只是不饿  卡拉
I'm just not that hungry, Kara.

266
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,350
不过等到我反击的时候  你会知道的
But when I do fight back, you'll know it.

267
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,740
有什么好笑的吗  马克
Something funny, Mark?

268
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,140
你们都是损坏品
You're both damaged goods.

269
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,710
让你们自相残杀岂止高效
Having the two of you take each other out wasn't just efficient,

270
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,190
简直美妙
it was poetic.

271
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,000
那为什么还用巡航导弹
So why the cruise missile?

272
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,110
确保万无一失
Had to be sure.

273
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,900
那你觉得效果怎么样呢
And how's that working out for you?

274
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,810
下次见
See you next time, huh?

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,940
该你们干活了
That's your cue.

276
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,810
吧台那里的人
The men at the counter.

277
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,580
跟出去
Follow them outside.

278
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,600
偷走他们的车
You're going to steal their car.

279
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,870
人家肯定会表示反对
Pretty sure they'll object to that.

280
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,630
那就让他们改变主意
So change their minds.

281
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,420
要用我的方法来解决吗
Or should I deal with them my way?

282
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,420
伙计
Hey, fellas?

283
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,710
有空吗
You got the time?

284
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,650
够了
That's enough.

285
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,310
我说够了
I said enough.

286
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,140
卡拉的游戏我奉陪
I'll play along with Kara's little game.

287
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,700
但不能杀害平民
But killing civilians isn't going to be a part of it.

288
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,370
明白吗
Clear?

289
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,570
好吧  约翰
Fine, John.

290
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,960
你有何建议
What do you suggest?

291
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,570
这家伙带着武器
This guy's carrying.

292
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,750
他们是烟酒火器管理局特工
They're ATF agents.

293
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,050
你们现在也是了
And now you are too.

294
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,620
你们就要接到临时任务了
You're being temporarily reassigned.

295
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,330
接电话  约翰
Answer the phone, John.

296
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,060
放聪明点  否则我保证
But be smart or I'll make it impossible

297
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,050
你和马克会尸骨无存
for anyone to tell where you end and Mark begins.

298
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,670
怎么
Yep?

299
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,020
贝克  莫瑟尔街780号有情况
Baker, we've got a situation developing over at 780 Mercer.

300
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,710

两位可以去干活了
Time for you boys to go to work.

303
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,940
穿好制服  扔掉电话
Take the jackets, lose the phones.

304
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,180
{\pos(147,140)}信息发送成功

305
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,810
我们会救回他  小熊
We'll get him back, Bear.

306
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,960
我保证
I promise.

307
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,300
请讲  警探
Yes, Detective?

308
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,480
斯诺从藤真科技偷的硬盘
So the hard drive Snow stole from Fujima

309
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,020

314
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,100
斯坦顿要它做什么
What would Stanton want with it?

315
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,000
要我猜的话
If I had to guess,

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,510
肯定是为了存储一些极度敏感或危险的信息
it's to store something highly sensitive or dangerous.

317
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,440
我刚接到了一条来自陌生号码的短信
Listen, I've just received a text from an unfamiliar number.

318
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,290
写了UXO
It reads "UXO".

319
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,030
UXO是军用代码
"UXO" is the military designation

320
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,640
指装有未爆品
for unexploded ordinance.

321
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,860
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese.

322
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,580
他可能穿着炸弹背心
He could be wearing a bomb vest.

323
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,710
我把号码发给你
Sending you the number.

324
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,100
你追踪一下
You need to track down the location

325

信息发送地点  警探
it was sent from, Detective.

326
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,990
这就去
I'm on it.

327
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,180
疏散这个区域
Clear this area!

328
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,730
尽快封锁街道
Lock down the street as soon as you can.

329
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,490

Come on, come on, come on.

330
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,800
所有人马上离开这里
Need everyone out of here right now!

331
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,780
我知道咱们是来处理什么事了

炸弹威胁

333
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,440
无法抗拒
Couldn't resist.

334
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,890
靠你们的伪装进入大楼
Now use your cover to get inside the building.

335
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,030
去乘电梯
Go to the elevators.

336
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,780
右后方第一部电梯
Get in the right rear one.

337
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,910
等一下  伙计们
Hold on, fellas.

338
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,170
防爆小组已经接管这里  他们
Bomb squad's running the show. They go--

339
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,410
我们不用听防爆小组的
We don't answer to the bomb squad.

340
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,820
怎么说呢  这是标准流程
What can I tell you? It's SOP.

341
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,630
你知道半公斤塑性炸药
You know what just a half pound of semtex

342
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,080
会对这栋楼和里面的人造成何等危害吗
can do to a building like this or the people in it?

343
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,680
-不  但我接到  -我知道
- No, but I got-- - Well, I do.

344
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,910
你耽误的时间越久
And the longer you delay us,

345
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,040
就越有可能亲身体会到
the more likely it is you're gonna find out.

346
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,610
让开
Now get out of the way.

347
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,870
警探  你找到他们了吗
Detective, did you find them?

348
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,700
没  不过他们来过
No, but they were here.

349
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
他们跟着另外两个人出去了
They followed two other men out.

350
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,970
发短信的电话是
It turns out the phone that sent the text

351
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,210
烟酒火器管理局探员的
belongs to an ATF agent.

352
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,320
他和搭档刚被派去处理
He and his partner were just called

353
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,150
莫瑟尔街780号的炸弹威胁
to a bomb threat at 780 Mercer.

354
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,210
炸弹威胁
A bomb threat?

355
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,480
那是栋办公楼  警探
It's an office building, Detective.

356
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,080
里面主要是商业和企业租户
Mostly commercial and corporate tenants.

357
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,650
不  这个有意思
No, this is interesting.

358
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,700
怎么
What is?

359
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,470
那栋楼有21层
The building has 21 floors,

360
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,370
但楼层指南只有20层
but the directory only lists 20.

361
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,280
21层被静水进口公司租下了
21st floor is registered to a Stillwater Imports.

362
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,350
然而静水进口公司没有
Except Stillwater Imports doesn't appear to have

363
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,940
进行任何商业活动
any ongoing business activity.

364
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,360
这是家空壳公司
This is a shell corporation.

365
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,540
我会继续查
I'll keep looking into it,

366
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,850
不管斯坦顿在找什么
but whatever Stanton's after,

367
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,800
肯定在那里
I bet it's in there.

368
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,690
你们要去21层
You're going to the 21st floor.

369
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,650
电梯只到20层
The elevator only goes to 20.

370
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,060
用输入面板
The access pad.

371
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,810
输入密码051573
Enter this code: 051573.

372
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,610
上面有什么
What's up there?

373
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,180
21层是五级国防部设施
The 21st floor is a level 5 DOD facility.

374
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,330
很遗憾  那里的守卫
Unfortunately, the men guarding it

375
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,710
不会因炸弹威胁这种家常便饭而离开
won't leave it for something as routine as a bomb threat.

376
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,750
他们看到你们肯定不会高兴的
And they're not gonna be very happy to see you boys.

377
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,900
该死  卡拉
Damn it, Kara.

378
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,160
算了吧  约翰  你就不怀念吗
Come on, John. Didn't you miss this?

379
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,190
咱们三人一起工作的时光
The three of us working together?

380
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,950
我们要对付的是什么人
What are we looking at?

381
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,260
要我猜的话
If I had to guess,

382
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,990
两个三角洲部队成员拿着M4步枪
two delta force operators with M-4s

383
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,900
只要电梯门未经授权打开就会
trained to fire if those elevator doors open

384
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,190
毫不犹豫地开火
without authorization.

385
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,150
用三角洲部队做守卫
Delta force for guards?

386
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,670
我们这是在哪儿
Where the hell are we?

387
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,840
高级叛逃者的安全屋吗
Safe house for high-level defectors?

388
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,440
也许是生化武器实验室
Bioweapons lab maybe.

389
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,100
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,940
我说什么来着
What did I say?

391
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,360
他们一旦脱身就会杀了我们
These guys get free, they're gonna kill us.

392
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,890
他们只是履行职责  我不认识他们
They're just doing their job and I don't know them.

393
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,610
这里我唯一确定该死的人是你
The only person here I'm pretty sure deserves to die is you.

394
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,430
看来你确实变了  约翰
I guess you have changed, John.

395
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,890
希望你的道德感不会把我们害死
I hope your conscience doesn't get us killed.

396
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,730
够了
Enough.

397
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,910
下一步要抓紧时间了  先生们
Time is a factor in this next stage, gentlemen.

398
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,000
这设施里可能会有些信号干扰
And there may be some signal interference inside the facility,

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,990
因此我要稍微改变下你们的激励机制了
so we'll have to change your incentives a little bit.

400
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,560
早上好
Good morning.

401
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,420
我本打算打开英语字幕
I was going to have them turn on the English captions,

402
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,020
不过我想起来  你的普通话很好
but then I remembered you're fluent in Mandarin.

403
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,700
你国家安全部的老板
Don't your bosses at the Ministry of State Security

404
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,750
就没有更好的事给你做了吗
have anything better for you to do?

405
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,310
亲爱的  你认为我为政府工作
My dear, if you think I work for the government,

406
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,310
我真得炒了我的裁缝了
I really must fire my tailor.

407
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,850
那你是为谁工作
Then who do you work for?

408
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,500
你在美国海军学院读过经典著作  卡拉
You read the classics at Annapolis, Kara.

409
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,060
还记得[希腊神话]泰坦吗
Do you recall the Titans?

410
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,950
旧神
The old gods?

411
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,800
他们惧怕新神
They were so afraid of the new gods--

412
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,820
他们的孩子
their own children--

413
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,590
于是就吃掉他们
that they ate them.

414
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,740
你为旧神工作  卡拉
You work for the old gods, Kara.

415
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,080
他们背叛了你
And they betrayed you.

416
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,690
他们想杀掉你
They were willing to kill you...

417
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,530
因为他们惧怕
because they're afraid.

418
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,380
他们隐约知道要发生什么了
They have an inkling of what happens next.

419
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,890
既然你不是为国安部工作  那你来这里干嘛
If you don't work for the MSS, then why are you here?

420
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,790
因为和中情局不一样
Because unlike the CIA,

421
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,310
我的组织认为你非常有用
my organization still thinks you could be very useful.

422
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,950
你觉得我会为你工作
You think I'd work for you?

423
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,000
扭断你脖子  我是不是就能继续看电视了
If I break your neck, can I go back to watching TV?

424
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
不  卡拉
No, Kara.

425
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,430
我知道你不会为我们工作
I know you wouldn't work for us.

426
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,840
不会为了钱
Not for money.

427
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,370
就像我说的  我玩的不是钱
But as I said, money is not my business.

428
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,600
我能给你提供你的旧东家无法给你
I can offer you what your old employers couldn't

429
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,620
也不愿给你的东西
or wouldn't give you.

430
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,200
我能给你答案
I can give you an answer.

431
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,450
你开口问就行了
You merely have to tell me the question.

432
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,900
谁
Who?

433
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,200
是谁害的我
Who did this to me?

434
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,830
严格说来
Precisely,

435
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,200
不是你的老上司  马克・斯诺
not your old boss, Mark Snow.

436
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,910
我都能想象出你对他的报复计划了
I have a fairly graphic idea of your plans for him.

437
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,470
但真正应该承担责任的人
But the person truly responsible.

438
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,800
是一开始卖掉这台电脑的人
The person who sold the laptop in the first place.

439
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,040
要我拿什么交换
In exchange for what?

440
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,830
你还记得
Do you remember...

441
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,340
泰坦是怎么灭亡的吗
how the Titans were finally killed?

442
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,220
在他们吃掉最小的孩子宙斯之前
Before they could eat their youngest child, Zeus,

443
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,660
用他的襁褓裹了一块石头
they wrapped a boulder in his swaddling clothes,

444
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,060
看着他的父亲被噎住
then watched as his father choked on it.

445
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,000
我们就位了
We're in position.

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,800
第一个目标是值班室
The first thing you'll hit is the security desk.

447
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,460
拿下摄像头  警报器
Take out the cameras, alarms,

448
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,860
清除备份里最后两小时的影像
and erase the last two hours on the backups.

449
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
我会告诉你们接下来怎么走
I'll tell you where to go from there.

451
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,950
{\pos(191,129)}无信号

452
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,270
我们进来了
We're in.

453
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,030
问题是进来哪儿了
In what is the question.

454
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,360
你们要找一名
You're looking for a technician

455
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,930
有高级许可的技术员
with high-level clearance.

456
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,770
试试找标着"应用研究"的恒温室
Try the temperature-controlled room labeled "Applied Research"

457
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,740
走  我们走  伙计们
Go. Let's go, folks.

458
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,250
到处找不到他们
I don't see them anywhere.

459
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,770
肯定已经上去了
Must already be up there.

460
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,370
卡特
Carter.

461
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,830

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,550
我听不清
I can barely hear you.

464
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,770
抱歉噪音很大
Sorry about the noise,

465
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,930
但我需要有更好匿名无线网络的地方
but I had to relocate to a place with better Wi-Fi anonymity

466
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,150
才好黑进国防部
before hacking the Department of Defense.

467
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,140
你黑进了国防部
You hacked the DOD?

468
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,660
静水进口公司是
Stillwater Imports is a cover

469
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,330
其网络安全控制中心的掩护
for their cyber security operations center.

470
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,350
那是什么
What is that?

471
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,440
台面上他们是监控和保护
Officially their role is to monitor and protect

472
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,530
敏感的政府网络不受网络恐怖主义影响
sensitive government networks against cyber terrorism.

473
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,170
私底下呢
And unofficially?

474
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,450
他们在研制攻击软件武器
They're developing weaponized malware

475
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,550
像震网病毒或火焰病毒
like Stuxnet and Flame.

476
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,130
你也许记得它们被用于
You may recall they were used

477
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,940
破坏伊朗核离心机
to sabotage Iranian nuclear centrifuges.

478
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,850
-网络战  -是的
- Cyber warfare. - Yes.

479
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,780
等等
Wait.

480
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,920
所以斯坦顿需要硬盘
That's why Stanton needed the hard drive.

481
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,970
为什么
Why?

482
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,560
她要让他们窃取网络武器
She's gonna have them steal a cyber weapon.

483
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,960
拿到后  她为之工作的人
With that, the people that she's working for

484
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,800
可以关闭整个国家的电网
could shut down a country's power grids,

485
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,790
瘫痪通信  甚至更糟
cripple their communications, or worse.

486
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,980
我们得阻止她  警探
We're gonna have to stop her, Detective.

487
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,490
我正在努力
I'm working on it.

488
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,190
我们得上到那层
We gotta get up to that floor.

489
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,890
你觉得防爆小组的小子们能让咱们过去吗
You think the bomb squad boys are gonna go for that?

490
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,970
那祝你好运
Good luck.

491
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,640
我们就说
We'll just tell 'em

492
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,600
是来协助清查楼梯的
we're gonna help 'em clear the stairs.

493
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,400
什么  等等  那可有20层啊
What? Wait, that's 20 floors.

494
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,670
21层
21.

495
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
就是那里
That's it.

496
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,150
我是对的
I was right.

497
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,960
生化武器实验室
Bioweapons lab.

498
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,960
不是生化  是电子
Not bio. Electronic.

499
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,810
那房间是敏感信息隔间设备
That room's a SCIF.

500
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,500
能防止无线电信号
Built to keep any wireless or radio signals

501
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,800
传入或传出
from getting in or out.

502
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,440
你们交的税用上了
Your tax dollars at work.

503
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,880
进去那个房间
You need to get into that room.

504
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,250
然后交给马克负责
Mark can take it from there.

505
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,470
那里面有什么  卡拉
What's in there, Kara?

506
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,320
进去就行了  别磨蹭
Just get inside and don't drag your feet.

507
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,940
否则你就引爆吗
Or you'll detonate?

508
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,700
你引爆  你的计划也要跟我们陪葬
You do and you'll blow up your plan along with us.

509
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,290
我喜欢你  约翰
Fond as I am of you, John,

510
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,510
可别要我提醒你  你是可损耗品
don't make me remind you just how expendable you are.

511
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,620
明天见  吉米
See you tomorrow, Jimmy.

512
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,880
我们需要你加会儿班
We're gonna need you to put in some overtime.

513
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,860
安静
Quiet.

514
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,800
-你们是谁  -兄弟
- Who are you? - Hey, bud.

515
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,310
你们知道自己在哪里吗
Do you guys have any idea where you are?

搭把手  行吗
Just give us a hand, would you?

Yes, we do or we're dead.

521
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,750

No, there's no signal.

522
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,640
她听不见
She can't hear us.

523
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,480
我们能想到法子阻止她
We can figure out a way to stop her

524
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,700
或至少取下炸弹背心
or at least a way out of these vests.

525
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,100
我试过了
I've tried.

526
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,590
-没办法  -肯定会有
- There isn't one. - well, there has to be.

527
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,060
我们没时间了
We don't have time.

528
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,470
-带他去服务器  -这边
- Show him the servers. - This way.

529
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,770
我查出硬盘接口就通知你

-你叫什么名字  -凯文

531
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,840
我会想办法让我们都活着出去  凯文

532
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,530
但我需要你的帮助
But I'm gonna need your help.

533
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,470
喂
Hello?

534
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,600
-是我  -里瑟先生
- It's me. - Mr. Reese.

535
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,380
时间有限  我现在在一处国防部设施中
I don't have much time. I'm in a DOD facility.

536
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,730
我收到你的信息了  她要你做什么
I got your text. What is she having you do?

537
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,670
偷个东西吧
Stealing something, I think.

538
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,310
她似乎想偷一件网络武器
I think she may be aiming to steal a cyber weapon.

539
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,730
网络武器
Cyber weapon?

540
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,330
那些盘里有什么
What's on these drives?

541
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,310
凯文
Kevin...

542
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,860
我们要想撑过这关  你必须相信我
If we're gonna survive this, you need to trust me.

543
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,240
网络信息战部队
Information warfare units.

544
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,740
病毒  蠕虫  军事级别的攻击软件
Viruses, worms, military-grade malware

545
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,620
用来感染摧毁敌军电脑网络的
designed to infect and destroy enemy computer networks.

546
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,840
所以这些机子都没联网
That's why these machines aren't networked.

547
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,410
是的  这里的一切都不允许外传
Yes, nothing in here can be allowed to get out there.

548
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,660
她应该在找一个程序  代号"天鹅座"
She may be looking for a project with a code name "Cygnus".

549
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,720
"天鹅座"在哪里
What is Cygnus?

550
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,200
那是新型超级病毒
It's a new super virus.

551
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,500
如果误入敌手  能毁掉大部分民用网络
In the wrong hands it could cripple major civilian networks,

552
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,160
我们自己的防御系统  甚至整个因特网
our own defense systems, even kill the entire internet.

553
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,470
也就是说  可以用来关掉机器
Which means it could be used to shut down the machine.

554
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,100
我不会允许的
I won't let that happen.

555
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,980
哈罗德  我要你离这里远点儿
Harold, I need you to stay clear of the building.

556
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,100
你要做什么
What are you going to do?

557
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,310
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

558
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,580
有没有办法清空那些盘
Is there a way to erase these drives?

559
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,730
除非系统出现安全漏洞
Only if there's a security breach to the system.

560
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,550
失效保护功能就会洗掉硬盘
Then its failsafe is to wipe the drives.

561
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,750
{\pos(192,137)}检测到安全漏洞

562
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,010
{\pos(205,118)}启动数据控制  清空全部盘

563
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,320
你干什么
What are you doing?

564
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,310
在她染指前毁掉"天鹅座"
Destroying Cygnus before she gets her hands on it.

565
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,080
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

566
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,710
你会害死我们  约翰
You're gonna get us killed, John.

567
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,060
走着瞧
We'll see.

568
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,770
把盘放回去
Put that drive back in.

569
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,500
不可能
Not gonna happen.

570
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,920
{\pos(148,165)}启动

571
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
别闹了  孩子们
Break it up, boys.

572
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,200
卡拉
Kara.

573
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,980
我知道你不会乖乖听命的  约翰
I knew you wouldn't follow orders, John.

574
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,670
就像在鄂尔多斯一样
Just like in Ordos.

575
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,740
-你胆怯了  -你来晚了
- You lost your nerve. - You're too late.

576
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,520
我已经清空了硬盘
I erased the drives.

你永远都看不清大局  是吧约翰
Never were one for the bigger picture, were you, John?

579
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,340
我只需要你们帮我扫清障碍
All I wanted was for you two to clear a path for me.

580
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,860
干得不错
Nicely done.

581

拿上硬盘
Get the drive.

582
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,330
走
Let's go.

583
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,040
看  我并不想从这里取走什么
See, I'm not looking to take anything from this place.

584
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,510
这些都已经落后一代了
These boys are at least a generation behind.

无意冒犯
No offense.

587
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,720
我只想送他们点东西
I'm more interested in giving them something.

588
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,040
这房间是干什么的
What is this room?

589
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,300
我们用来监控
Where we monitor

590
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,720
政府最高安全网络抵抗网络攻击
the government's most secure networks against cyber attacks.

591
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,390
她从这里可以访问到
From here she could reach--

592
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,430
一切
Everything.

你干了什么  卡拉
What have you done, Kara?

595
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,080
干我的工作  约翰
My job, John.

596
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,380
卡拉  听着
Kara, listen.

597
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,460
我明白你的感受
I know how you feel.

598
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,840
我当时也在鄂尔多斯  记得吗
I was in Ordos too, remember?

599
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,710
没错  我们被伤害了  背叛了
And, yes, we were burned, betrayed...

但我们活下来了
But we survived.

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,470
放手吧
You've gotta let it go.

603
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,320
还不晚
It's not too late.

604
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,330
你可以终止这一切
You can end this.

605
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,820
约翰
John.

606
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,030
我正有此意
I plan to.

607
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,170
我之前说的是真的
I meant what I said before.

608
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,370
我怀念这个
About missing this.

609
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,370
但他们说的是对的
But it's true what they say.

610
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,980
你已无法再回家
You can't go home again.

611
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,820
别了 各位
So long, fellas.

612
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,040
你能不能控制开门
Can you override the door?

613
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,340
不能
No.

614
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,240
但我可以让房间的能量供应超负荷
But I can overload the room's power supply

615
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,080
应该能造成紧急停机
which should cause an emergency shutdown.

616
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,170
还锁着
Still locked.

617
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,110
肯定是备用电源启动了
Battery backup must have kicked in.

618
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,270
在这边
Over here.

619
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,490
待在原地
Stay put.

620
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,150
我们追不上她了
We'll never catch up with her.

621
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,040
我们要远离平民
We need to get clear of any civilians.

622
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,500
我们可以上楼顶
We can get up to the roof--

623
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,340
上帝啊  里瑟
God, Reese.

624
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,210
这套自我牺牲精神
The whole self-sacrifice bit

625
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,310
已经有点过时了  不是吗
beginning to wear a little thin, don't you think?

626
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,680
局里有间安全屋  就在两条街外
Agency's got a safe house less than two blocks from here.

627
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,940
机会不大  但我别无他选了
It's a long shot, but it's all I got.

628
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,470
就算你赶到了
Even if you made it,

629
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,200
你以为局里会再接受你吗
you think the agency would take you back?

630
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,830
在他们眼里  你已经叛变了
In their eyes, you're compromised.

631
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,750
想想吧
Think about it.

632
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,200
等待你的只有黑布罩头
All that's waiting for you is a black hood.

633
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,980
祝你好运  约翰
Good luck, John.

634
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,770
-约翰  -卡特
- John! - Carter.

635
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,350
你们得马上离开
You need to get off this floor right now.

636
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,120
不  我们要帮你取下炸弹背心
No, we need to get you out of that vest.

637
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,230
-不行的  -我在伊拉克见过很多
- You can't. - I saw enough of them in Iraq.

638
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,050
带她离开
Get her out of here.

639
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,190
约翰  拜托听我说
John, please listen to me--

640
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,390
没时间了
There's no time.

641
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,390
你有太多不能舍弃的
You've got too much to lose.

642
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,560
不  约翰  不要这么做
No, John, you are not doing that.

643
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,820
莱奈尔
Lionel?

644
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,320
-卡特  他是对的  -放开我
- Carter, he's right. - Get off of me.

645
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,570
想想你儿子
Think of your son.

646
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,450
约翰
John.

647
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,520
不要这么做
You don't have to do this.

648
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,010
你知道我必须
You know I do.

649
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,640
换你也会做同样的事
Because you'd do the exact same thing.

650
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,890
谢谢
Thank you.

651
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,000
谢谢你们
Both of you.

652
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,440
来  卡特  我们走  来
Come on, Carter, let's go. Come on.

653
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,430
看来我没迟到
So I see I'm not too late.

654
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,630
我早该知道你会来
I should have known you'd turn up here.

655
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,290
我告诉过你离远点儿
I told you to stay clear.

656
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,000
所以我知道
Which is how I knew

657
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,560
你会有此打算  里瑟先生
you'd put yourself in a situation like this, Mr. Reese.

658
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,040
站住别动
Stay where you are.

659
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,510
这里
Here.

660
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,090
查出硬盘里的内容  加以阻止
Find out what's on that hard drive and stop it.

661
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,430
你能否让我
Will you just let me--

662
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,160
你要做什么
What are you gonna do?

663
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,540
开枪吗
Shoot me?

664
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,250
这是我的过去导致的
This is my past catching up with me.

665
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,740
跟你没关系
It doesn't concern you.

666
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,890
现在有关系了
But this moment does.

667
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,640
我不会离开你  约翰
I'm not leaving you here, John.

668
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,030
所以我们别再浪费时间了好吗
So can we please stop wasting time?

669
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,210
看看情况如何
Let's see what we've got here.

670
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,580
你以前拆过炸弹背心吗
Have you ever defused a bomb vest before?

671
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,950
不能说拆过
Can't say I have.

672
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,370
不过我肯定明白基本原理
But I believe I grasp the basic principles.

673
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,090
我心甚慰啊
Well, that's encouraging.

674
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,020
她显然是用手机
It appears that she's wired the phone

675
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,000
作为触发器
to a capacitor-based trigger.

676
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,950
电话一打进来  就会触发电容器
If the phone is called, it will charge the capacitor

677
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,760
从而  进一步导致触发单一
which will, in turn, release it's charge in a single--

678
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,700
芬奇
Finch.

679
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
抱歉  积习难改
I'm sorry. This is my process.

680
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,080
能停掉计时器吗
Can you shut off the timer?

681
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,840
没法侵入电池系统
I can't get at the battery.

682
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,320
我需要黑到手机锁定码
I need to hack the phone's lock code.

683
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,070
能做到吗
Can you do it?

684
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:27,060
我造过有史以来最复杂的电脑系统
I have built some of the most complex computer systems in existence.

685
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,690
我肯定能解锁手机
I can certainly unlock a phone.

686
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,950
所有手机都有个通用的解锁码
All phones have a universal unlock code

687
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,400
基于其模式独一无二的手机串号
based on their model and the unique "IMEI" number.

688
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,510
好了
Okay.

689
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,050
对这部手机来说  是五个组合中的一个
For this phone, it's one of five combinations.

690
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,100
这挺好
That's good.

691
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,200
问题是我们只有三次尝试机会
The problem is we only get three attempts

692
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,420
然后手机就会永远锁定了
before the phone permanently locks us out.

693
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,590
这不好
That's not.

694
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,330
看来这个不对喽
I take it that one didn't do it?

695
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,410
抱歉
Sorry.

696
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,890
-你好  卡拉  -完成了
- Hello, Kara. - It's done.

697
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,060
是的
Yes.

698
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,410
我看到了  干得不错
So I see. Nicely done.

699
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,550
接下来交给我们
We'll take it from here.

700
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,450
现在我要你履行承诺
Now I want what you promised.

701
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,450
卖掉这台电脑
The person who sold the laptop

702
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,360
导致你中国不幸之旅的人
that took you on your unfortunate trip to China.

703
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,680
或者说幸运之旅  要看从谁的角度看了
Or fortunate, depending on one's view.

704
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,260
名字
The name.

705
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,860
恐怕我能给你的也只有名字
I'm afraid a name is all I have for you...

706
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,770
此人似乎在所有数据库中都不存在
for someone who seemingly does not exist on any known database.

707
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,970
也许你查起来会比我有运气
Perhaps you'll have better luck in your search than I did.

708
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,000
说吧
Go ahead.

709
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,090
怎么了
What?

710
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,400
你曾经说过
Something you said once.

711
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,070
迟早有一天  我们俩会死掉
About how sooner or later we'd both probably end up dead.

712
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,130
我喜欢迟点
I'd prefer later.

713
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,900
毕竟  最初是我把你拉进来的
After all, I'm the one that got you into this in the first place.

714
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,090
我很确定  如果不是你找到我  我已经死了
I'm pretty sure I'd be dead already if you hadn't found me.

715
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,310
难说
It's hard to say.

716
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,390
不难说
Not really.

717
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,180
选一个吧  哈罗德
Pick a winner, Harold.

718
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,570
你是对的  卡拉
You were right, Kara.

719
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,750
关于死  我特别擅长
About me being dead, I'm gonna be great at it.

720
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,530
肯定是哑弹
Must have been a dud.

721
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,010
看来斯诺还是退休了
Guess Snow retired after all.

722
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,570
乖
Boy.

723
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,910
警探
Detective?

724
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
摩斯特工
Agent Moss.

725
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,830
有何贵干
What brings you by?

726
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,540
我们辨认出了
We identified

727
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,360
国防部设施自杀炸弹客的身份
the suicide bombers who broke into the DOD facility.

728
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,810
是两位离队的中情局特工
Apparently they were a couple of rogue CIA agents.

729
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,540
中情局不肯吱声  不过我们认为他们是职业的
Agency's not saying a peep, but we think they went pro.

730
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,740
这一位  马克・斯诺
This one, Mark Snow,

731
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,170
很符合那位"西装男"的描述
fits the description of your "Man In A Suit".

732
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,640
真的吗
