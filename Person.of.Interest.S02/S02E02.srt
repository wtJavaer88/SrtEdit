她现在应该35岁了  应该就是她

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,910
所以除非说汉娜从坟墓出来显灵了  否则
So either Hanna's communicating from beyond the grave, or...

306
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,310
她还活着
She's still alive.

307
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,140
能不能拜托你停手
Can you please make this stop?

308
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,740
在头套里再待上一个小时
Another hour in that hood,

309
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,740
我说什么他就会信什么
and he'll believe anything I say.

310
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,220
多神奇啊  人类的大脑
Amazing how easily the human brain

311
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,820
多容易被操控啊
can be manipulated.

312
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,020
不过这个你知道的  不是吗  丹顿
But you know that, don't you, Denton?

313
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,240
国防部最高机密备忘录批准授权

314
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,090

包括  巴勒斯坦吊刑
including "Palestinian hanging,"

316
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,370
就是你正在享受的这种
which you are currently enjoying.

317
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,490
最后是谁的签名
Whose signature is at the end?

318
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,190
-怎么  是你啊  -求你

对不起  不被允许
Sorry, not allowed.

321
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,430
除非你告诉我  我想知道的东西
Unless you tell me what I want to know.

322
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,940
女士  我不懂你在说什么
Lady, I have no idea what you're talking about.

323
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,260
我是一名白宫律师
I'm a White House lawyer.

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,220
我只签署文件  并没有读
I sign documents. I don't read 'em.

325
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,890
求你  看在上帝的份上  放我下来
Please, for the love of God, let me down.

326
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,540
除非你告诉我机器在哪里
If you tell me where the machine is.

327
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,920
什么机器
What machine?

328
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,990
他造的那台机器

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,630
内森・英格拉姆以一美元价格卖给你的那台机器

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,170
我什么都不知道  我发誓
I don't know anything. I swear.

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,900
说真的  哈罗德  人们为什么总是
Really, Harold, why do men always seek

333
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,880
不见棺材不落泪呢
to delay the inevitable?

334
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,310
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

335
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,360
我吗
Me?

336
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,260
你以为我受过创伤  有童年阴影吗
You think I was damaged? Some childhood trauma?

337
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,800
我是个甜心噢
I'm so sweet.

338
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,080
放他下来
Let him down.

339
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,920
求你了

水  求你了
Water, please.

342
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,440
这场戏要转场到公路上继续了
Oh, we need to get this show on the road.

343
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,430
鉴于你刚喝了200升硫喷妥钠[吐真剂]
And since you just drank half a pint of sodium pentothal,

344
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,980
我正好有时间去给车加个油
that gives me time to go gas up the car.

345
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,540
等我回来的时候
By the time I get back,

346
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,490
你应该准备好吐出你小脑袋里的所有东西了

347
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,420
你
You.

348
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,640
我认识你

你和内森・英格拉姆共事过
You work with Nathan Ingram.

350
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,620
你得帮我逃走
You have to help me get free.

351
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,490
我们面临着最大的问题
We have a major problem.

352
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,710
不能让她获取机器的权限
She cannot get access to the machine.

353
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,530
假设汉娜逃跑了  几年后
Assuming Hanna runs away, a couple years later,

354
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,600
她在路易斯安那州拉斐特市出现
she winds up in Lafayette, Louisiana,

355
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,800
开了个账户  存入了十万块

356

之后的三周内一直在取现

357
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,710
直到账户关闭
until the account is closed.

358
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,320
十万块
100 grand.

359
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,660
一个离家出走的16岁女孩哪里弄到的钱
Where does a 16-year-old runaway get all that money?

360
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,080
约瑟・巴瑞亚  现在正处于终身监禁中
Jose Barilla, currently serving 17 life sentences

361
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,650
罪名是贩毒及谋杀

362
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,450
那钱从他账户电汇出去的
The money was electronically transferred out of his account.

363
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,280
你说过这个"根"擅长电脑

364
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,580
是的
Yes, I did.

365
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,450
但这个账户把我们引向了哪里
But where does the account lead us?

366
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,760
就是这儿
Right back here.

367
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,890
这是个共同署名的账户

368
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,650
一个叫特伦特・拉塞尔的人

369
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,540
本地地址  就在毕夏普

370
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,580

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,010
没错  他在目击者名单上
Yeah, he was on the witness list,

372
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,320
就在她从图书馆消失的那天晚上
in the library that night she disappeared.

373
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,890
你还有那个地址吗
You still got that address?

374
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,630
是谁
Who is it?

375
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,450
拉塞尔夫人  我是卡特警探
Mrs. Russell, it's Detective Carter.

376
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,890
你丈夫在家吗

377
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,390
拉塞尔夫人
Mrs. Russell?

378
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,560

379
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,660
特伦特・拉塞尔是你丈夫吗

380
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,430
我们能和他谈谈吗
Can we talk to him?

381
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,310
特伦特15年前就去世了
Trent passed away almost 15 years ago.

382
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,580
我很遗憾

00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,520
-我们能进来吗  -请进
- Can we come in? - Oh, come in.

384
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,750
我们结婚没几年

385
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,640
我们在图书馆认识的
We met at the library.

特伦特是读书俱乐部的成员

387
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,530
我非常想念他

388
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,150
他怎么死的

389
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,660
太可怕了
It was awful.

390
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,480
他被袭击了

391
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,740
-枪击致死  -知道凶手是谁吗
- Shot to death. - They know who did it?

392
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,940
警察说似乎是毒贩所为
Police said it looked like a drug killing,

393
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,880
边境过来的败类
some trash from over the border,

394
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,340
但一直没抓住他们
but never caught them.

395
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,270
特伦特是银行贷款职员
Trent was a bank loan officer.

396
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,950
他是否卷入了洗钱活动
Is it possible he got caught up in money laundering?

397
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,340
不  他是好人
No, he was a good man.

398
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,870
那是搞错了
It was just a mistake.

399
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,470
他认识汉娜・弗雷多久了
How long did he know Hanna Frey?

400
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,000
汉娜  他不认识
Hanna? He didn't.

401
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,660
那你要怎么解释这个
Then how do you explain this?

402
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,670
他以汉娜的名义开了户
He signed for a bank account in her name

403
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,360
就在她失踪两年之后

404
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,500
一定是哪里搞错了
This must be some kind of mistake.

405
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,990
对  就跟他被谋杀一样

406
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,330

00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,900
我介意  你们得离开了
Yes, I do. You need to leave now.

408
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,950
卡特
Carter!

409
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,760
那通911报警电话
That 911 call.

410
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,360
看到汉娜上车的目击者
The witness who saw Hanna get into the car--

411
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,820
说了个车牌号
there was a license plate.

412
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,220
等等
Hold on.

413
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,770
报警人说  是汉娜的事  那个失踪的女孩子
Caller: It's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.

414
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,610
我看到她上了一辆车
I think I saw her get into a car

415
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,390
就在图书馆外面
outside the library.

416
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,830
"接线员问到车的品牌
"The operator asked about the make of car,

417
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,020
"但打电话的人只记得
"but the only thing the caller can remember

418
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,310
车牌是  925ESK"
is the license plate-- 925 ESK."

419
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,340
925EFK
925 EFK.

420
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,880
报警人记错了一个字母
The caller got one digit wrong.

421
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,990
或者接线员记错了
Or the operator did.

422
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,630
这就是那辆车吗
Are we saying this is the car?

423
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,790
特伦特・拉塞尔绑架了汉娜・弗雷
Trent Russell kidnapped Hanna Frey?

424
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,030
也许  也许拉塞尔抓住了她  但她逃了
Maybe--maybe Russell took her, but she escaped.

425
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,960
然后去复仇
She got her revenge.

426
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,060
为什么这么说
How can you say that?

427
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,370
因为账户是以拉塞尔的名义开的
Because of the bank account in Russell's name.

428
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,390
这是"根"的行事风格  她陷害他
It's how Root works. She set him up.

429
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,670
她从毒贩那里偷了十万块
She stole 100 grand from a drug dealer.

430
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,370
毒贩发现钱不见时
When he found out it was missing,

431
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,430
要追杀的人是拉塞尔
the person he went after was Russell.

432
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,990
拉塞尔否认  但没用
Russell denies it, but it's useless.

433
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,300
账户上写的是他的名字
His name is on the account.

434
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,650
而另一个名字是
The only other name is that of a girl

435
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,510
一个两年前死去的女孩
who's been dead for two years.

436
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
只可能是他在说谎
He has to be lying.

437
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,760
求你们了  求你们了
Please, please!

438
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,420
所以绑架汉娜的家伙
So the man who kidnapped Hanna

439
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,280
在停车场被枪杀
gets gunned down in a parking lot.

440
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,950
而受害人却消失无踪
And his victim is in the wind,

441
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,710
还拿走十万美金
100 grand the richer.

442
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,350
是"根"  一定是"根"
It's Root. It has to be Root.

443
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,060
我们得搜查这栋房子
We need to search that house.

444
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,450
我们得通知警长
We need to call the sheriff.

445
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,360
我们得走正路处理这案子  约翰
We need to handle this the right way, John.

446
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,690
她很快就会回来
She'll come back soon.

447
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,710
我知道你不愿相信我  你不了解我
I know you're reluctant to trust me--you don't know me--

448
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,730
我了解你  威克斯先生
I do know who you are, Mr. Weeks.

449
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,270
你曾试图黑进机器
You tried to hack the machine.

450
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,200
我试过  那是我的工作
I certainly tried. It was my job.

451
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,990
我得测试它的极限  确认它是否安全
I had to test its limits, see if it was safe.

452
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,670
但我们预想了所有的危机
But in all of our crisis scenarios,

453
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,900
却没料到会这样
we never envisioned this.

454
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,120
会有人找上我们中的一个
That someone would get to one of us.

455
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,110
她不会通过我找到机器
She won't get to the machine through me.

456
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,050
但你要知道  如果你不帮我逃跑
But you must see that if you don't help me get free,

457
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,890
我们就会失去机器
we will lose the machine.

458
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,250
我要怎么做
What can I do?

459
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,590
那把刀

460
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,720
想办法推过来
Try to push it to me.

461

别担心  我不会杀她的

464
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,780
至少得先查清她知道什么
At least not until I've found out what she knows.

465
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,200
那么  英格拉姆的信息技术人员

466
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,830
我们一直都怀疑那西装笔挺的笨蛋
We always suspected the idiot in the tux

467
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,310
不可能一个人搞成功
couldn't have done it on his own.

468
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,540
你想怎么样
What do you want?

是汉娜那天晚上从图书馆借出的书
The book Hanna checked out that night at the library.

473
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,080
你卧室里有十六本

474
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,890
哪来的
Where'd you get 'em?

没有留言  没有寄件人
No note, no sender.

482
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,940
好像有人就是想折磨我
Like someone just wants to be cruel.

483
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,070
卡特
Carter.

484
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,670
最近寄过来的书里面有东西
The most recent book did have something.

485
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,410
我去找是谁买的
I'm gonna find out who bought it.

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,210
你待在这里
You stay here.

487
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,800
她还没全招
She's not done yet.

488
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,240
她是真把我逼急了
She really sent me over the edge.

489
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,270
你有什么计划  威克斯先生
So what's your plan, Mr. Weeks?

490
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,560
收拾好这里
Tidy this up,

491
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,400
找几个真正的专家审问这个贱人
get some real experts to question this bitch.

492
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,320
但既然你特别想隐姓埋名
But since anonymity means a lot to you,

493
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,850
而且又帮了我
and because you helped me,

494
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,750
我会放你走
I'm gonna let you go wherever you want.

495
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,400
只要回答一个问题
Just one more question.

496
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,950
她能成功吗
Can she get to it?

497
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,070
我得知道它是否安全

499
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,120
拜托

500
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,350
无法远程修改
It cannot be altered remotely.

501
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,780
如果要做改动
If anyone wanted to change anything,

502
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,420
必须接触到服务器吗
they'd have to have physical access to the servers?

503
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,470
对
That's right.

504
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,660
那么只要位置没暴露
So if the location is hidden,

505
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,890
机器就是安全的
the machine is safe.

506
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,680

听说你住这儿  伙计

513
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,320
我觉得是时候重赛了
I think it's time for a rematch.

514
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,010
别以为你能再把我打趴下
Don't think you're gonna sucker punch me again. Oh!

我是斯蒂尔斯警探  纽约警局凶案组的

女孩被问及姓名  但不肯透露

可恶  又死在痢疾这题上了

541
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,280
这游戏多傻啊  汉娜
That game's so dumb, Hanna.

542
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,200
真不明白你为什么要玩
I don't see why you play it.

543
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,340
因为我就要去俄勒冈了

550
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,440
可能因为这  她总在图书馆转悠
I guess that's why she always hung around the library.

551
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,170
为什么你确定是萨姆打的电话

她说她见到汉娜上了一辆车

芭拉  为什么你不告诉我

因为萨姆看到了谁在车里

她说
She said...

560

她觉得是拉塞尔先生
she thought it was Mr. Russell.

561
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,230
为什么你什么都不说
Why in the hell didn't you say anything?

562
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,910
我说了  我说了
I did. I did say something...

我简直不敢相信她会

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,070
把拉塞尔先生想得那么坏
such a terrible thing about somebody like Mr. Russell,

567
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,830
他对我们小镇
who'd done so much for this town

568
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,540
我们图书馆  我们所有的孩子贡献巨大
and the library and all the children.

569
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,880
我让她闭上她那骗人的臭嘴
And then I told her to keep her lying little mouth shut.

570
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,900
为什么
Why?

571
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,300
因为我当时爱上了特伦特・拉塞尔
Because I was in love with Trent Russell,

572
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,440
我无法相信他会做这种事
and I couldn't believe he'd do such a thing.

573

我宁愿死也不会把机器交给你

卡特  你开租来的车吧

有人借给了我一辆货车
Guys are lending me a truck.

618
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,640
为什么床上有个十字弩

这张卡约三小时前在马里兰州刷过

626
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,650
是根  汉娜就是根

628
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,870
她不是汉娜
She's not Hanna.

629
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,440
汉娜被埋到地下了  约翰

谁寄出了这些书  害死了拉塞尔

汉娜的父亲给我的

635
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,030
她名叫萨姆・格罗夫斯  是汉娜的朋友

母亲在大约10年前去世

萨姆从此离开小镇  杳无音讯
So Sam left town, was never heard from again.

643
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,810
如果说谁是根  那肯定是她
If anybody's Root, it's gotta be her.

644
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,570
是她带走了芬奇
