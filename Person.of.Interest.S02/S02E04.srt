so back at ya, George.

125
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,820
肖恩的事是场悲剧
What happened to Sean was tragic.

126
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,240
但跟俄罗斯人纠缠的是他  不是我
But he's the one that made his bed with the Russians, not me.

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,730
我还以为他是为你工作呢  乔治
I thought he worked for you, George.

128
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,870
是的  但他自己的债是自己的事
Yeah, but his debts were his own.

129
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,560
他是个堕落的赌鬼  所以才会被杀
He was a degenerate gambler, and it got him killed.

130
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,040
你最好学会接受这点  安妮
You had better learn to accept that, Annie.

131
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,830
我接受  我同时还记得
I do, but I also remember

132
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,290
肖恩曾是全世界最好的人
that Sean was the sweetest guy in the world

133
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,970
直到他开始为你工作
until the day he started working for you.

134
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,640
所以无论他是否堕落  我会永远想念他
So degenerate or not, I'll always miss him.

135
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,620
不知道你走之后  谁会想念你呢  乔治
I wonder who's gonna miss you when you're gone, George.

Improvising.

162
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,880
你他妈哪儿不正常
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

163
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,990
现在吗  你脸上的表情呗
Right now, that look on your face.

164
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,800
再喝一杯  聊解千愁
Nothing another drink won't fix.

165
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,760
把他轰出去
Get him outta here.

166
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,130
成功了吗  里瑟先生
Were you successful, Mr. Reese?

167
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,820
马上就知道了
I'll know in a minute.

168
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,810
安妮这事
This thing with Annie.

169
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,350
-算了老爸  -算了
- Forget about it, pop. - Forget about it?

170
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,340
你听到她今天跟我说话的口气了
You heard the way she spoke to me today.

171
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,200
大庭广众之下跟我提她那个二货亡夫
Bringing up that idiot husband of hers in public.

172
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,020
过去人们知道何谓尊重
Used to be people had some respect.

173
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,200
其中一点就是要知道几时该闭嘴
Part of that was knowing when to keep your mouth shut.

174
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,430
也许我该去拜访一下她
Maybe I should pay her a visit.

175
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
为什么
Why?

176
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
你有什么特别的办法搞定她吗
You got some special way of getting through to her?

177
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,120
我可以告诉她放弃纠结这事
I can tell her to drop the subject.

178
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,740
她看上去像是会放弃的人吗
Does she look like the type who would drop anything?

179
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,230
说不准啊  老爸  莱利挺有说服力的
I don't know, pop, Riley can be pretty persuasive.

180
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,190
好吧
Okay.

181
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,860
你过去  今晚去找她
You go up there. See her tonight.

182
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,090
好的
Okay.

183
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,530
但不是让她闭嘴
But not to shut her up.

184
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,300
而是让她彻底消失
To make her disappear.

185
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,550
我不确定  老大
I don't know, boss.

186
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,810
不确定
Don't know?

187
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,890
不确定什么
Don't know what?

188
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,950
她是自己人的遗孀
She's the widow of one of the boys.

189
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,910
可能会有损士气
Might hurt morale.

190
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,490
士气
Morale?

191
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,730
你是在担心谁的士气
Whose morale are you worried about?

192
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,270
他们的
Theirs?

193
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,520
还是我的
Or mine?

194
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,110
好的  老大
Okay, boss.

195
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,170
我来搞定
I'll take care of it.

196
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,830
好  看你的了
Okay. See that you do.

197
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,370
带上埃迪
Take Eddie.

198
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,620
用珍珠那儿
Use the Pearl.

199
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
别留下痕迹
Don't leave a trace.

200
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,990
芬奇  那位执刑人
Finch, our enforcer

201
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,630
要去追杀餐厅里那姑娘了
is going after the girl from the restaurant.

202
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,970
那名服务员  安妮
The hostess? Annie?

203
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,490
她刚成为他的下一个目标
She just became his next target,

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,510
而他也成了我的目标
and he just became mine.

205
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,520
里斯先生  我应该不需要提醒你
Mr. Reese, I assume I don't need to remind you

206
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,030
你跟的是危险分子
these are dangerous men you're following.

207
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,490
我已经做好了预防措施  芬奇
I've taken all precautions, Finch.

208
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,930
你找到安妮的信息了吗
You find anything on Annie?

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,430
是的  她的全名是安妮・德莱尼
Yes, her name is Anne Delaney,

210
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,710
在布鲁克林出生长大
born and raised in Brooklyn.

211
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,830
她九个月前丧夫  她丈夫肖恩・德莱尼

212
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,930
在布莱顿海滩被射杀

213
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,700
那里当时是俄罗斯人的地盘
That was Russian territory then

214
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,630
后来才被以利亚接管
before Elias took it all over.

215
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,400
乔治的手下可不应该去那种地方
Not the place to be if you're one of George's crew.

216
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,970
你有她的地址吗
You have an address for her?

217

东39街 1424号

你正在朝那个方向去
You're headed in that direction.

219
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,470
你想怎么做
So how do you want to do this?

220
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,160
悄悄做
Quietly.

221
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,930
是啊  但怎么做呢  老头子说要没有痕迹
Yeah, but how? The old man said no trace.

222
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,350
我会处理的
I'll handle it.

223
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,030
你帮我望风  准备好处理尸体就行
You just keep an eye out and be ready to help with the body.

224
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,120
你听到了吗  里瑟先生
Are you hearing this, Mr. Reese?

225
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,690
别担心  芬奇
Don't worry, Finch.

226
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,370
我保证他们无法接近她
I'll make sure they don't get anywhere near her.

227
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,030
有人给莱利打电话
Someone's calling Riley.

228
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,660
不  是乔治给埃迪打电话
No, it's George calling Eddie.

229
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,590
-喂  -别说话  听着就行
- Yeah? - Don't talk, just listen.

230
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,250
你今晚动手以前
Before you do that thing tonight,

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,280
先处理我们提过的另外那件事
I want you to handle that other business that we talked about.

232
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,660
-莱利  -你确定
- Riley. - You sure?

233
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,840
你今天听到他说的了  埃迪
You heard him today, Eddie.

234
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,920
我给他机会坦白交待了  但他没有
I gave him a chance to come clean, he didn't take it.

235
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,790
我没法再信任他了
I can't trust him anymore.

236
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,640
他只能消失
So he goes.

237
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,980
然后是那姑娘
Then the girl.

238
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,290
你能处理好吗  还是要我亲自处理
Now can you handle this, or do I need to?

239
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,550
不不  我明白
No, no. I got it.

240
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,170
很好  搞定给我电话
Good. Call me when it's done.

241
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,100
怎么了
What's up?

242
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,390
没什么  老头子打电话查岗
Nothing, the old man was just checking in.

243
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,410
你知道他的
You know how he gets.

244
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,940
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I do.

245
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,620
我们可能搞错了  芬奇
We may have this one wrong, Finch.

246
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,340
也许莱利才是受害人
Riley might be the victim after all,

247
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,430
不过可能已经晚了
but I think I'm too late.

248
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,380
晚了
Too late?

249
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,770
什么意思  里瑟先生
What do you mean, Mr. Reese?

250
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,460
怎么回事
What was that?

251
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,770
等等  芬奇
Hang on, Finch.

252
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,760
里瑟先生  他在打电话给安妮
Mr. Reese, he's calling Annie.

253
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,400
喂
Hello?

254
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,410
是我
Hey, it's me.

255
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,350
你还好吗  你听上去很紧张
You okay? You sound stressed.

256
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,030
我很好  安妮  听着
I'm fine. Annie, listen.

257
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,440
出事了
Something's gone wrong.

258
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,880
乔治  他肯定发现了我们的事
George--he must have found out about you and me.

259
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,070
什么  你确定吗
What? Are you sure?

260
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,570
是的  非常确定
Yeah. Pretty sure.

261
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,230
我刚才不得不杀了埃迪
I just had to kill Eddie.

262
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,440
上帝
Oh, my God.

263
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,870
安妮  没事的
Annie, it's gonna be all right.

264
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,510
没事  你刚杀了乔治・梅西的儿子
All right? You just killed George Massey's son.

265
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,630
听着  安妮
Just listen, Annie.

266
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,210
拜托  去我们的地方等着
Please, just go to our place and wait.

267
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,460
我先去个地方  然后就去找你
I'm gonna make a quick stop, and then I'll be there.

268
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
好吗
Okay?

269
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,720
安妮
Annie.

270
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,100
好的
Okay.

271
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,640
我爱你
I love you.

272
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,620
我也爱你
I love you too.

273
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,700
我刚才没听错吧
Did I just hear that right?

274
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,430
那位执刑人居然爱上了他要杀的女人
Our enforcer is in love with the woman he was sent to kill?

275
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,150
没错
Yeah.

276
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,950
就是说我们要保护两个人了  芬奇
Which means we now have two people to protect, Finch.

277
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,570
里瑟先生  莱利和安妮碰面了吗
Mr. Reese, has Riley met up with Annie yet?

278
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,070
还没
Not yet.

279
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,790
肯定有别的办法找到她
There must be some other way to locate her.

280
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,470
也许  但乔治肯定会派人追杀他们俩
Maybe, but George will be gunning for both of them.

281
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,370
没错  但安妮是其中的无辜受害人
Yes, but Annie is the innocent victim in this equation.

282
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,500
你是说我们只保护安妮  不管莱利吗
Are you saying we should protect Annie but not Riley?

283
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,630
我只是说不值得让你和安妮冒风险
I'm just saying you might not want to put yourself and her

284
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,150
去保护他那种人
at risk for a man like that.

285
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,610
他是个杀手  里瑟先生
He's a killer, Mr. Reese.

286
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,410
我也曾是  芬奇
So was I, Finch.

287
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,090
我认为你们之间区别很明显
I think there's a distinction to be made.

288
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,630
没你想得那么明显
Not as much as you think.

289
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,720
他身陷绝境  时日无多
Well, he's a desperate man running out of time,

290
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,500
乔治不是唯一追他的人
and George won't be the only one after him.

291
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,430
警察也会开始寻找杀害埃迪的凶手
The police will be looking for Eddie's killer as well.

292
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,110
看来得让我们两位警探开始干活了
Guess it's time to put our two detectives to work.

293
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,310
-我是卡特  -早上好  警探
- Carter. - Morning, Detective.

294
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,150
不行  先等我喝完早晨咖啡再说
No, not until I've had my morning coffee.

295
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,800
-你可以随身拿着  -拿去哪里
- You can take it with you. - Take it where?

296
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,500
我把地址发给你
I'm sending you the location.

297
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,130
为什么  那里有什么
Why? What's there?

298
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,690
他一露面  我们就干掉他
Shows his face, we'll take him out.

299
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,520
肯定的
Absolutely.

300
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,670
尸体
A body.

301
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,810
芬奇  乔治的人
Finch, George's men

302
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,730
已经在莱利的公寓楼了
are already at Riley's apartment building.

303
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,870
他肯定知道埃迪的事了
He must know about Eddie.

304
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,490
也就是说他们也在找安妮了
Which means they'll be looking for Annie too.

305
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,800
我们得确认她没在家里
We need to make sure she's not at her place.

306
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,930
芬奇
Finch?

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,370
我可以叫弗斯科去
I can call Fusco.

308
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,190
不  没关系
No, that's all right.

309
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,660
好的  我到了再打给你
Yes, I'll call you when I get there.

310
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,970
没关系
It's okay.

311
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,080
我没事的
I'll be fine.

312
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,080
催查车牌那边加急
See if you can put a rush on those plates.

313
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,990
好的
Sure.

314
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,090
只要它们在系统里有记录
If they're in the system,

315
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,310
我要第一时间知道
I want to know as soon as you do.

316
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,080
好的  交给我了
All right. You got it.

317
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,230
舍曼斯基警探
Detective Szymanski.

318
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,870
你又回来工作了  真好
It's good to see you back on active duty.

319
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,940
我考虑过死了算了  但意识到
You know, I thought about dying, but I realized

320
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,020
就凭一个警探的薪水我还死不起
I couldn't afford it on a detective's salary.

321
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,460
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

322
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,750
听说这儿有尸体
Heard there was a body.

323
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,510
这么快
Already?

324
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,840
凶案组可不能浪费时间
Homicide Task Force doesn't mess around.

325
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,150
-什么情况  -车祸
- What you got? - It's a car wreck.

326
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,750
死者是埃迪・梅西
The deceased is Eddie Massey.

327
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,090
不妙啊
Not good.

328
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,950
我听说他爸爸脾气不好
I hear his dad's got a temper.

329
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,830
埃迪喝多了吗
Eddie have too much to drink?

330
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,130
驾驶受干扰  确实
Under the influence, yes.

331
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,590
但不是因为酒精  而是子弹
But not alcohol, hollow points.

332
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,560
侧身中两枪  近距离射击
Two in the side, close range.

333
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,510
枪还在枪套里
Well, his weapon's still holstered.

334
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,670
凶手一定是突然袭击的
Shooter must have taken him by surprise.

335
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,700
他的乘客
His passenger?

336
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,480
看起来是的  安全气囊弹开了
Sounds right, airbag deployed.

337
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,530
只有在前排坐人[散弹枪]的情况下才会弹开
Only goes off if someone's riding shotgun,

338
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,910
不过这次不是散弹枪而是点三八
or in this case, .38 caliber.

339
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,330
如果枪手当时在车里
Well, if the shooter was in the car,

340
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,240
埃迪应该认识他
Eddie probably knew who he was.

341
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,150
瞧瞧我们找到了什么
Let's see what we got here.

342
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,250
今早接过一个匿名电话
Received a call from a blocked number early this morning,

343
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,400
之后还有几个未接电话
and then after that, several missed calls.

344
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,730
-有人在找他  -也许是他爸爸
- Somebody's looking for him. - Probably his dad.

345
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,030
是啊
Yup.

346
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,140
安妮已经走了
Annie's already gone.

347
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,200
有什么线索能查到她去哪里了吗
Anything to tell us where she went?

348
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,220
芬奇
Finch?

349
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,540
我在找  我在找
I'm looking. I'm looking.

350
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,520
有发现吗
Any luck?

351
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,990
还没有
Nothing yet.

352
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,850
他们要说有秘密约会的地方
If they've got a secret meeting place,

353
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,100
那她隐藏得很好
she's hidden it well.

354
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,290
当然
Oh, of course.

355
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,890
别停留太久被逮住
Well, just don't get caught hanging around.

356
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,240
没那打算
I don't intend to.

357
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,110
你联系过我们的警探了么
Did you reach our detectives?

358
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,990
两个都派上了
I got them both on the job.

359
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,880
舍曼斯基警探
Detective Szymanski.

360
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,560
乔治  这位是卡特警探
George, this is Detective Carter.

361
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,500
我听说了你几个月前的事故
I heard about the incident you had a few months ago.

362
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,080
真担心我们会失去你
Feared we might have lost you.

363
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,650
乔治  恐怕要告诉你个坏消息
George, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

364
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,490
埃迪死了
Eddie's dead.

365
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,630
我知道了
I'm aware.

366
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,990
听到这消息你似乎不怎么难过
You don't seem too upset about the news.

367
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,770
每个人表达悲伤的方式不一样  警探
We all deal with grief differently, Detective.

368
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,750
那你是怎么表达的
How are you dealing with yours?

369
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,600
找出杀害我儿子的凶手  你就会看到了
Find my son's killer, and you'll see.

370
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,690
乔治  你最后一次看到埃迪是什么时候
George, when was the last time you saw Eddie?

371
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,750
昨天
Yesterday.

372
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,740
我们吃过午饭  回到这里
We had lunch, came back here.

373
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,970
知道他昨晚那么晚还在那里干什么
Any idea what he was doing out so late last night

374
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,990
和谁在一起吗
or with whom?

375
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,040
不知道
Couldn't say.

376
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,080
车祸前不久他接过一个电话
He received a call shortly before the crash.

377
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,200
是你打的吗
Was it from you?

378
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,800
有时间纠缠我
You know, instead of badgering me,

379
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,630
你们何不出去找找
shouldn't you be out there trying to find out

380
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,470
杀害我儿子的凶手
who killed my son?

381
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,960
你的手下呢
Where's your crew?

382
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,760
我的什么
My what?

383
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,440
你的儿子刚被枪杀
Well, your son was just gunned down,

384
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,670
可能是敌对帮派干的
maybe by a rival gang.

385
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,650
我以为你会采取点保护措施
I'd expect you to have some protection.

386
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,040
-我能照顾好我自己  -想来也是
- I can take care of myself. - I'm sure.

387
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,120
也许你已经知道凶手是谁了
Or you already know who the shooter is,

388
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,460
你的手下已经在追杀他了
and your boys are out looking for him.

389
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,130
放心吧  警探
Rest assured, Detective,

390
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,430
如果我找到了杀害埃迪的凶手
if I find the person responsible for Eddie's murder,

391
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,520
你们永远都不会知道
you'll never know.

392
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,620
喂
Yep?

393
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,020
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

394
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,390
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

395
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,500
告诉所有人  他们就要出现了
Check in with everybody. They'll show up.

396
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,400
他们一到  就通知我
When they do, I want to know.

397
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,630
里瑟先生  我好像发现了点东西
Mr. Reese, I may have found something.

398
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,750
太好了  芬奇
That's good, Finch,

399
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,100
因为我好像弄丢了点东西
because I may have lost something.

400
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,590
安妮很谨慎  没留下她和莱利
Annie was very careful not to leave any clues

401
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,870
约会地点的线索  不过
as to her and Riley's meeting place, but...

402
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,730
似乎有一个
maybe there is one.

403
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,130
她的电脑桌面是一张她拍的
Her laptop wallpaper is a view of the city

404
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,850
城市景观照
from a photo she took.

405
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,910
好吧
Okay.

406
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,510
根据估测准线
By measuring the alignment,

407
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,170
和照片里主要建筑的相对尺寸
and relative size of the key buildings in the photo,

408
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,500
我能够确定拍摄地点的
I was able to determine the geographical coordinates

409
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,120
地理坐标
of the spot where it was taken.

410
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,410
在海拔15米左右
Approximately 50 feet above sea level.

411
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,390
太好了  你的巫毒术能给出个地址吗
Great, now does any of that voodoo produce an address?

412
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,090
埃克福德街460号
460 Eckford.

413
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,480
还有那是三角定位原理
And it's trigonometry.

414
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,280
我们怎么知道那里跟莱利有关系
How do we know that has anything to do with Riley?

415
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,680
因为
Because...

416
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,150
埃克福德街460号是他档案中的第一个地址
460 Eckford is his first known address.

417
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,400
是他长大的地方
It's where he grew up.

418
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,010
这么说他带她回家了
So he brought her home.

419
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,740
那儿离你只有四个街区
It's only four blocks away from you.

420
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,340
乔治是怎么发现的
How did George find out?

421
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,770
无所谓了  我们必须得离开
It doesn't matter, we gotta go.

422
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,030
我得把你送上火车
I gotta get you on a train and

423
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,240
走得越远越好  安妮
as far away from here as possible, Annie.

424
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,500
-我  -是的
- Me? - Yes.

425
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,930
你是说我们吧  你不走我也不走
You mean us. I'm not leaving without you.

426
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,590
安妮
Annie.

427
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,320
你说想离开这城市
You said you wanted out of the city.

428
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,490
你说我们可以去西部找个开阔的地方
You said we'd find some wide open place out West

429
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,570
一起从头开始
and start over together.

430
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,630
他们在找我
They're looking for me.

431
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,640
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

432
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,160
你不走我也不走  我做不到
I won't do this without you. I can't.

433
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,340
你可以的  安妮  听我说
Yes, you can, Annie. Now listen, okay?

434
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,160
-我准备  安妮  -不不  你听我说
- I'm gonna--Annie. - No, no! You listen to me.

435
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,720
肖恩过世后  你来我们餐厅
After Sean died, you came by the restaurant.

436
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,570
给我电话号码
You gave me your number,

437
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,510
说如果我有任何需要
and you said if I ever needed anything,

438
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,140
尽管找你  记得吗
to just call, you remember?

439
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,540
是的
Yeah.

440
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,280
后来我的热水器坏了
And then my water heater broke.

441
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,130
忽然爆了  水溅得到处都是
Just exploded, water everywhere.

442
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,330
是啊  你给我打了电话
Yeah, and you called.

443
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,560
我以为你早忘了
I didn't think you'd even remember,

444
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,870
但你说你马上就来
but you said you'd be right there,

445
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,600
你真的来了
and you were.

446
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,920
虽然来了也没什么用
Of course you were next to useless,

447
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,630
只是在没过脚的水里乱来一气
splashing around in water up to your ankles.

448
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,910
松松这个  紧紧那个
Loosening this, tightening that.

449
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,730
但你来了  信守了承诺
But you came. You kept your promise,

450
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,370
之后的每一次都是如此
just like you did every time after that.

451
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,470
你总是陪着我
You were there.

452
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,530
我很喜欢
I love that.

453
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,150
知道有你可以信赖  我需要这样
Knowing I can count on you, I need to know that.

454
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,930
我不在乎谁知道了  或者有多危险
So I don't care who knows or how dangerous it is.

455
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,050
没有你我不会走  绝不
I'm not going anywhere without you, not ever.

456
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,220
好吗
Okay?

457
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,460
-好吗  -好吧
- Okay? - Okay.

458
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,380
-我们走  -好的
- Let's get going. - Okay.

459
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,650
-里面是什么  -积蓄
- What's in there? - Savings.

460
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,100
这些钱足够我们去任何地方
It's enough money to get us wherever we need to go.

461
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,930
不
No.

462
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,270
不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no!

463
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,800
不如你意了吗
Not what you were expecting?

464
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,610
乔治
George.

465
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,140
以为我不知道你的藏钱处吗
You didn't know I knew about your stash, huh,

466
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,940
以为我不知道你搞上了肖恩的女人吗
or the fact that you were sticking it to Sean's old lady?

467
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,120
你想怎么样
What do you want?

468
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,770
让我儿子起死回生如何
How about my son back?

469
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,340
我很抱歉  乔治
I'm sorry, George,

470
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,400
但埃迪逼得我走投无路
but Eddie didn't give me a choice.

471
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,340
你过会儿可以亲自向他道歉
Well, you can apologize to him yourself in a moment or two.

472
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,980
蹲下
Get down!

473
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,830
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

474
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,130
芬奇  乔治的手下伏击了他们
Finch, George's men tried to ambush them.

475
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,440
莱利带着安妮跑了
Riley's with Annie on the run.

476
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,030
千万小心  里瑟先生
Do be careful, Mr. Reese.

477
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,610
多谢提醒  芬奇
Thanks for the tip, Finch.

478
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,740
里瑟先生  你没事吧
Mr. Reese, is everything all right?

479
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,050
死不了
I'll survive.

480
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,370
-安妮和莱利怎么样了  -不太确定
- What about Annie and Riley? - I'm not sure.

481
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,380
埃迪车上采集到的指纹是莱利・卡瓦诺的
Prints taken off Eddie's car belong to Riley Cavanaugh,

482
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,130
梅西最顶级的执刑人之一
One of Massey's top enforcers.

483
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,280
难怪乔治一点都不惊恐
Oh, no wonder George wasn't sweating.

484
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,790
他是在找自己的手下
He was looking for one of his own.

485
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,960
大楼的一名住户说
One of the building tenants

486
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,980
她看到了一个符合卡瓦诺特征的人
said she saw a guy matching Cavanaugh's description,

487
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,660
带着个女人离开了大楼  可能是人质
leaving the building with a woman, could be a hostage.

488
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,930
我们知道他什么情况
What do we know about him?

489
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,380
他是过去两年三起黑帮袭击案的嫌犯
He's a suspect in three mob-related hits over the past two years.

490
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,670
冷血杀手一个

491
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,620
我们要把他找出来  绳之以法
We gotta find him, take him down.

492
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,700
我是舍曼斯基
Szymanski.

493
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,410
行  明白  好的
Yeah, we got it. Okay.

494
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,670
就这个
That's the stuff.

495
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,310
-生日快乐  -你怎么知道的
- Happy birthday. - How did you know?

496
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,250
在重新考虑保护是否该莱利吗
Reconsidering your decision to protect Riley?

497
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,390
不是  在想是否该弄件新衬衫
No, just thinking I should grab a new shirt.

498
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,630
他冲你开枪了  约翰
He shot you, John.

499
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,060
他不是有心的
It wasn't personal.

500
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,980
我们应该集中精力解决更紧迫的问题
Maybe we should focus on the more pressing issue

501
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,330
先找到他们
of finding them.

502
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,620
怎么样  警探
Yes, Detective?

503
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,370
你家那位恐怖的高酷帅先生
Your partner, Mr. Tall Dark And Fearsome

504
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,490
-可真把梅西逼急了  -什么意思
- really got Massey steamed. - Meaning what?

505
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,900
意思是他在道上悬赏追杀卡瓦诺跟那妞儿
Meaning he put a bounty on Cavanaugh and the broad.

506
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,680
-多少钱  -一百万
- How much? - A million.

507
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,150
有消息通知我
Keep me informed.

508
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,640
如果弗斯科警探的消息没错
If Detective Fusco is correct,

509
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,930
安妮和莱利会被全城的雇佣杀手追杀
Annie and Riley will have every hired gun in the city looking for them.

510
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,490
乔治没那个实力
George is too small of a fish

511
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,860
闹这么大动静
to pull off a move like this.

512
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,150
这得要向全城放话
He'll need to get the word out city-wide.

513
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,740
那他会向谁寻求这种帮助呢
And who would he reach out to for that kind of help?

514
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,750
你想想办法呗
See what you can do.

515
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,520
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

516
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,220
乔治把莱利准备重新生活的钱拿走了
George took the money Riley was gonna use to start over.

517
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,230
他们离城前  他需要弄到钱
He'll need to get more before they leave town.

518
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,370
我大概知道他们会去哪儿
I think I know where they might go.

519
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,420
你好  卡特
Hello, Carter.

520
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,520
莱利・卡瓦诺  这就是你要保护的人
Riley Cavanaugh? That's who you're protecting?

521
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,500
他在保护一名无辜的女人
He's protecting an innocent woman.

522
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,000
你为什么不早点告诉我
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

523
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,610
因为我需要你去审问乔治・梅西
Because I needed you to question George Massey.

524
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,120
你是说分散他的注意力
You mean distract him.

525
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,860
-那女人呢  -安妮・德莱尼
- What about the woman? - Annie Delaney.

526
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,740
到目前为止  莱利最能保护她
Right now, Riley's her best protection.

527
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,420
好吧  舍曼斯基也想抓那家伙
Yeah, well, Szymanski's also looking to take this guy down.

528
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,790
所以我要你和他待在一起
Which is exactly why I need you to stay with him,

529
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,510
阻止此事发生
to make sure that doesn't happen.

530
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,440
你想让我扰乱谋杀案调查
You want me to derail a homicide investigation.

531
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,740
还有别的吩咐吗
Anything else?

532
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,150
再联系
I'll be in touch.

533
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,280
手头就这么多
This is all I have on hand.

534
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,460
需要的话我可以去银行
I can go to the bank if you need more.

535
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,670
不用了阿里  已经很好了
No Al. This is great.

536
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,560
我会都还给你  我保证
I'll pay you back every cent, I promise.

537
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,100
安妮  有人早前来过
Annie, some men came by earlier,

538
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,790
乔治的手下  问起你
George's men, asking for you.

539
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,050
你怎么说的
What did you say?

540
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,430
实话实说  我没见到你
The truth. I hadn't seen you.

541
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,470
真不知道该怎么谢你  阿里
I don't know how to thank you, Al,

542
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,180
谢谢你为我做的一切
everything you've done for me.

543
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,700
安妮  你真的没事吗
Annie, are you sure you're okay?

544
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,050
是的  别担心
Yeah, don't worry.

545
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,750
谢谢你
And thank you.

546
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,580
芬奇  有人想抓
Finch, someone's trying to collect the bounty

547
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,890
莱利和安妮领赏
on Riley and Annie.

548
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,050
我们得走了
We gotta go!

549
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,330
走错路了  几位
Wrong way, guys.

550
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,730
芬奇  我找到莱利和安妮了
Finch, I found Riley and Annie,

551
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,280
赏金猎人也找到他们了
and so have the bounty hunters.

552
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,950
我们的老朋友那边有进展吗
Any luck with our old friend?

553
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,590
稍后给你消息
I'll have an answer for you shortly.

554
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,750
开门
The gate.

555
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,640
你们下去吧
You guys can go.

556
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,960
似乎你让我处于劣势了
So I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage,

557
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,280
克灵先生  是吧
Mr. Crane, is it?

558
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,880
显然你知道我的一些事
You obviously know something about me,

559
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,330
但我对你一无所知
but I know nothing about you.

560
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,340
我的同事救过一个
The man I work with saved the life

561
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,430
和你关系密切的人  查理・伯顿
of someone close to you, Charlie Burton.

562
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,200
原来你是老大
So you're the boss.

563
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,680
那我似乎
I suppose I, uh--

564
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,470
我应该感谢你救了我一命
I...should thank you for saving my life,

565
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,110
以及享受目前这待遇
as well as my current accommodations.

566
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,130
我相信你没让自己闲着  以利亚先生
I trust you're keeping yourself busy, Mr. Elias.

567
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,470
显然你对这座城市犯罪集团的控制
Certainly your control of the city's criminal enterprises

568
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,680
未有稍减
appears undiminished.

569
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,370
物质方面都被剥夺了
Well, being stripped of all possessions

570
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,740
倒免去了不少纷扰
eliminates a lot of distractions.

571
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,000
我有充足的时间读书  思考  下棋
I've got time to read, to think, to play chess.

572
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,220
不过你懂的  找个势均力敌的对手
Though, you know, finding a worthy opponent

573
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,850
颇有点难度
has been a little challenging.

574
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,160
你找我什么事
What brings you to see me?

575
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,090
有位小头目的事需要你帮忙
We need help with a minor boss

576
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,020
他的帮派目前并没有归顺你
whose organization may not be under your control yet.

577
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,710
乔治・梅西
George Massey.

578
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,800
我听说他儿子的事了
I heard about his son.

579
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,060
-我们约翰干的吗  -不  他自己手下人干的
- Our friend John's handiwork? - No, one of his own men,

580
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,010
那人现在受我们保护
fallen under our protection now.

581
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,220
梅西悬赏一百万追杀他以及
Massey's put a million-dollar bounty on him

582
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,350
和跟他一起的女人
and the woman he's with.

583
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,870
是啊  真土豪啊
Ah, yes. So flashy.

584
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,920
梅西这种老东西  永远都不懂
Relics like Massey, they never learn.

585
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,020
真正的大玩家
There's so much more to be gained

586
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,680
会避开关注  隐身幕后
by staying out of the limelight, in the background.

587
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,740
这种人才是真正需要提防的
Those are the people you have to watch out for.

588
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,610
正是
Indeed.

589
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,620
我们认为梅西会向这种人寻求帮助
We thought he might reach out to such a man for help.

590
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,750
如果真的如此  我们希望能说服你
If so, we hoped we could convince you

591
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,100
拒绝支持
to withhold your assistance.

592
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,200
你想让我叫停梅西的狩猎派对吗
So you want me to shut down Massey's little hunting party?

593
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,860
我似乎确实欠了你一条命
Well, I suppose I do owe you something for saving my life.

594
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,280
即便如此  凡事都有代价
Even so, everything does come with a cost.

595
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,090
我想也是
I assumed there would be.

596
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,160
你想要什么
What is it you want?

597
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,190
我说过了  我对物质方面没什么需求
Well, as I said, I have no need of possessions.

598
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,370
列车将在五分钟后由35号站台出发
Will be leaving from track 35 in approximately five minutes.

599
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,930
我去买票  好吗
I'm gonna go get some tickets, okay?

600
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,460
-我跟你一起去  -不不  你留在这
- I'll go with you. - No, no. Just stay here.

601
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,450
-里瑟先生  -说吧  芬奇
- Mr. Reese? - Go ahead, Finch.

602
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,960
赏金猎人的问题已经基本解决了
I believe our bounty hunter problem has been neutralized.

603
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,990
你真说服以利亚出手了
You actually got Elias to help yourself.

604
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,030
是的  他禁了乔治的悬赏
Yes, he's made George's bounty forbidden fruit.

605
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,370
谁敢动手  就得向他交待
Anyone going after it will have to answer to him.

606
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,960
温馨提示  请不要将您的随身物品
As a reminder, please do not leave your bags--

607
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,410
看来还有人没收到消息啊  芬奇
Looks like someone didn't get the message, Finch,

608
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
他还想着赚这钱呢
and he's still gonna try to collect.

609
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,100
那边
Over there!

610
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,490
里瑟先生  发生了什么事
Mr. Reese, what's happening?

611
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,510
有个赏金猎人在追杀莱利
One of the bounty hunters is going after Riley.

612
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,410
他抓住莱利了吗
Did he get to him?

613
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,620
没有  那赏金猎人抓了安妮
No, the bounty hunter took Annie.

614
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,590
她不见了
She's gone.

615
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,910
跟我来
Follow me!

616
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,590
里瑟先生  你在哪儿
Mr. Reese, where are you?

617
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,710
跟踪莱利  警察盯上他了
Following Riley. Police spotted him.

618
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,900
但你刚才说安妮被抓走了
But I thought you said that Annie had been taken!

619
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,920
没错
I did.

620
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,690
那为什么还在莱利身上浪费时间
Then why are you wasting time on Riley?

621
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,470
他是个杀手  他只是
He's a killer. He's just...

622
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,800
错误代码
bad code.

623
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,720
-错误什么  -当我没说
- Bad what? - Forget it.

624
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,140
莱利目前所做的一切都是为了保护安妮
Everything Riley's done so far is to protect Annie.

625
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,240
赏金猎人最终会把她交给乔治
The bounty hunter still has to deliver her to George,

626
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,270
所以莱利会去那里
so that's where Riley's headed.

627
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,770
怎么样  警探
Yes, Detective?

628
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,130
梅西行动了
Yeah, Massey's on the move.

629
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,280
知道他去了哪里吗
Do you know where he was headed?

630
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,200
不知道  他肯定是从后门溜出去的
No, he must have slipped out the back.

631
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,340
好的  他回来就给我电话
Okay, call me if he returns.

632
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,100
你他妈是谁
Who the hell are you?

633
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,400
一个知道你在对抗什么的人
Someone who knows what you're up against.

634
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,780
是吗  你知道什么
Yeah? What do you know?

635
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,180
我知道你杀埃迪是为了救安妮
I know you shot Eddie to save Annie.

636
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,640
还知道你自从她丈夫被杀之后
And I know you've been protecting her

637
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,190
就一直在保护她
since her husband was killed.

638
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,570
俄罗斯人干的  是吗
Russians, right?

639
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,850
是的
That's right.

640
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,930
真奇怪  居然在他还欠着一大笔钱时杀了他
Strange they'd kill him when he still owed them so much money

641
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,860
还把他的尸体扔在自己的地盘
and then leave his body in their own territory.

642
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,970
太奇怪了
It's very strange,

643
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,310
除非俄罗斯人根本没杀肖恩
unless maybe the Russians didn't kill Sean.

644
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,250
也许另有他人
Maybe it was someone else,

645
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,870
某个想嫁祸给他们的人
someone who wanted to make it look like they did.

646
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,400
专业的人  比如你
A professional. Someone like you.

647
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,020
肖恩偷藏钱  拿去还给俄罗斯人
Sean was skimming to pay back the Russians.

648
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,500
乔治发现了  让人办了他
George caught him and had him whacked.

649
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,520
乔治让人杀了他
George had him killed,

650
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,090
但下手的人  是你
But the hit-- it was you.

651
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,190
杀了肖恩后  乔治让我监视安妮
After Sean, George had me keep tabs on Annie.

652
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,460
他对她有意思
He had a thing for her.

653
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,950
他同时希望她不要问太多问题
He also wanted to make sure she didn't ask too many questions.

654
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,900
但你却爱上了她
But you fell for her instead,

655
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,680
乔治发现了
and George found out.

656
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,150
安妮是无辜的
Annie doesn't deserve any of this.

657
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,270
她只是想远走高飞  重新开始
She just wants to get away from here and start over.

658
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,960
但她不知道肖恩的事
But she doesn't know about Sean.

659
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,810
你真以为这事能就此了结吗
Do you really think you can run away from that?

660
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,380
不
No.

661
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,050
我知道自己什么货色
I know what I am.

662
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,580
但我也知道
But I also know that

663
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,980
她是我生命中最美好的
she's the best thing that's ever happened to me,

664
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,560
我会不惜一切代价救她
and I will do whatever I gotta do to save her.

665
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,920
如果你就这样贸贸然跑去找乔治
Well, if you go charging in at George half-cocked,

666
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,520
还没救到她  你自己就死了
you'll be dead before you can even do her any good.

667
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,890
走  我们得快
Come on, we need to move.

668
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,210
走
Come on.

669
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,820
是死胡同
It's a dead end.

670
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,570
现在呢
What now?

671
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,320
尽力而为
We consider our options.

672
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,920
朝警察开枪绝对不行
Shooting at cops isn't one of them.

673
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,640
你有更好的主意  说来听听
You got a better idea, let's hear it.

674
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,030
失陪一下
Excuse me.

675
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,840
-好的  -卡特
- Yes. - Carter.

676
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,570
情况如何  警探
How's it going, Detective?

677
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,860
舍曼斯基对那杀手布下了搜索网
Szymanski's got a dragnet out for your hit man.

678
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,730
我建议你暂时离远点儿
I suggest you steer clear for a while.

679
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,720
那可有点困难
Well, that's gonna be a little difficult.

680
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,150
别说你正和他在一起
Don't tell me you're with him.

681
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,850
好吧  我不说  但我还是需要你的帮助
Okay, I won't, but I still need your help.

682
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,680
约翰  这家伙杀了埃迪・梅西
John, this guy killed Eddie Massey.

683
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,580
埃迪准备杀掉他和一名无辜的女人
Eddie was gonna kill him and an innocent woman.

684
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,320
我相信地检官会予以考虑的
Well, I'm sure the DA will take that into consideration.

685
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,040
这不是在帮莱利
This isn't about helping Riley,

686
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,280
而是在救安妮
it's about saving Annie.

687
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,610
如果我错了
Look, if I'm wrong...

688
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,390
我会亲手把他交给你
I'll turn him in to you myself.

689
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,440
有线索了
I got a tip!

690
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,870
我有线人看见卡瓦诺出现在43街和10街交叉处
One of my CIs saw Cavanaugh over near 43rd and 10th.

691
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,950
-调人过去  快  -出发
- Call it in. Come on. - Let's go.

692
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,040
43街和10街交叉处有目击报告
We got a sighting at 43rd and 10th.

693
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,770
你居然还掌握着一名警探
You got a detective in your pocket?

694
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,080
谈不上是掌握
More like on my back.

695
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,200
43街和10街交叉处发现嫌犯
Suspect reported near 43rd and 10th.

696
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,960
走吧
Let's go.

697
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,460
芬奇  我找到莱利了  现在去找安妮
Finch, I've got Riley. We're going to get Annie.

698
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,560
她不在乔治的酒吧
Well, you won't find her at George's pub.

699
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
弗斯科警探说他匆忙离开了
Detective Fusco said he left in a hurry.

700
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,280
乔治会把安妮带到哪里去
Where would George take Annie?

701
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,330
-珍珠那儿  -什么
- The Pearl. - The what?

702
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,830
翡翠珍珠  乔治开的夜店
The Emerald Pearl's a nightclub that George owned.

703
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,800
之前倒闭了  不过他留着  用于其他业务
It went under, but he kept it for--uh, for other business.

704
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,830
比如处理尸体
Like making bodies disappear.

705
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,130
你知道那地方
You know this place?

706
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,320
-知道  -走吧
- Yeah. - Let's go.

707
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,260
她男朋友呢
What about her boyfriend?

708
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,410
见他时  他正在朝门外跑
Last I saw, he was running for the door.

709
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,660
我怎么一点也不吃惊呢
Why am I not surprised?

710
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,470
没关系
That's okay.

711
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,650
我很快就会逮住那个懦夫
I'm gonna catch up with that coward soon enough.

712
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,770
我现在可以拿到钱了吧
So I suppose I'll be taking my money now.

713
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,250
一百万是买两个人的
The million was for the both of them.

714
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,610
一半也可以
I'll settle for half,

715
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,320
除非你觉得不合理
unless you think that's unreasonable.

716
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,970
管它呢  我现在心情很好
What the hell, I'm in a good mood.

717
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,090
科里  给他钱
Corey, get this guy his money.

718
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,690
你干什么呢
What do you think you're doing?

719
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,610
给你们老大送礼
Bringing your boss a present.

720
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,490
我应该可以领到报酬了
I believe I'm due a reward.

721
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,310
原本事情不至于此  对吧
You know that none of this needed to happen, right?

722
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,390
我想帮你  安妮
I wanted to help you, Annie.

723
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,980
而我得到了什么
And what did I get?

724
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,690
感谢  不
Gratitude? No.

725
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,630
侮辱
Insults!

726
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,270
把肖恩的事归罪于我
Blame for Sean.

727
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,910
说实话  这点你还真对了
Oh, to tell the truth, you were right on that score.

728
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,240
肖恩不仅是个堕落的赌鬼
You see, Sean was not only a degenerate gambler,

729
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,970
他还是个小偷
he was also a thief.

730
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,540
我给了他应得的报应
I gave him what he deserved.

731
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,660
你还有脸说莱利是懦夫
And you call Riley a coward.

732
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,630
莱利  是啊
Riley. Yeah.

733
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,880
莱利跟你说过吗
Did Riley ever tell you--?

734
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,370
不  当然没有
No, of course not.

735
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,530
说什么
Tell me what?

736
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,670
肖恩到底怎么了
What really happened to Sean.

737
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,290
放她走  乔治
Let her go, George.

738
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,390
瞧瞧
Well, look at that.

739
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,710
谁敢动一下  我先毙了你
Anybody moves, I'm shooting you first.

740
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,380
见到你真好  孩子
Hey, good to see you, kid.

741
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,340
你可为我省了50万
Yeah, you know, you just saved me 500 grand.

742
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,320
你还好吗  安妮
Are you okay, Annie?

743
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,470
她没事
Oh, she's fine.

744
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,660
我们刚刚正在谈肖恩呢
We were just having a little conversation about Sean.

745
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,660
放她走  乔治
Let her go, George.

746
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,180
-别动  -他没法同时向我们两个开枪
- Don't. - He can't shoot both of us.

747
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,620
也没那必要
He won't have to.

748
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,180
带上安妮  去厨房  我来掩护
Take Annie, go for the kitchen, I'll cover you.

749
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,690
不  你离得更近
No! You're closer.

750
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,210
带她离开
Get her out of here.

751
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,130
走  照顾好安妮
Go! Take care of Annie!

752
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,140
-我们得走了  -莱利不走我也不走
- We have to move. - I'm not leaving without Riley.

753
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,650
安妮  走
Annie, go.

754
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,000
走  没事的
Go, it's okay.

755
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,620
我会过去的
I will be right there.

756
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,620
快走
Go!

757
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,290
我就不该派埃迪去
I never should have sent Eddie.

758
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,430
我应该亲手杀了你
I should have killed you myself.

759
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,900
她说得很对
She was right, you know.

760
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,850
没人会想念我们的
No one's gonna miss either one of us.

761
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,810
莱利呢
Riley?

762
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,120
-我们不能抛下他  -我不会的
- We can't leave him. - I'm not.

763
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,460
带她离开
Get her out here.

764
