我觉得你很特别
I think you're really special.

你们都不敲门的吗
Don't you knock?

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,490
你偷了我们的钱  我们得要回来

Hey, come on, g-guys.

60
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,330
严格说来诈骗诈骗犯不能算犯罪
It's not technically a crime to scam a scammer!

61
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,790
不过切掉一个人的肠子
But it is a crime to cut out a man's intestines

Okay, that's a big mistake.

66

是的  你们最好快逃吧
Yeah, you better get out of here.

67

Right now, while you still can.

68

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,160
你开啥玩笑  人家很烦恼的
Are you kidding? I'm distraught.

跟我说说我们的新号码吧
So tell me about our new number.

86
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,150
他叫卢・米切尔  退休的修表匠
His name is Lou Mitchell, a retired watch repairman.

87
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,010
鳏夫  无子
He's a widower with no children.

88
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,050
妻子玛里琳六个月前死于癌症
His wife Marilyn died of cancer six months ago.

89
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,230
我找到的资料都发你了
I'm sending you everything I was able to find.

90
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,360
可跟的不多啊  芬奇
Not much to go on, Finch.

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,740
卢就像他这个年龄段的人一样  没有手机
Like many people his age, Lou has no cell phone,

92
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,540
没有电邮  几乎没有网络数据资料
no email, almost no digital footprint.

93
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,350
我们必须得亲身去探
We'll have to use a more hands-on approach.

94
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,800
看到他了
Got him in my sights now.

95
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,810
你
You!

96

What's a guy have to do to get a little popcorn around here?

97
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,220
卢今天不太走运啊  芬奇
Luck isn't on Lou's side, Finch.

98
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,210
看来他今晚输了不少钱
Looks like he's burned through some cash tonight.

99
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,980
直接告诉我哪儿搞爆米花
Just point me in the direction of the pop secret.

100
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,650
我自己来吧
I'll make it myself, huh?

101
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,600
他玩的是百家乐
Seems his game of choice is baccarat.

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,060
他喜欢经典
He enjoys the classics.

103
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,770
这种很简单  双方
It's designed to be simple. Two hands.

104
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,150
玩家  庄家
Player, banker.

105
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,420
猜哪方手里的牌加起来最接近九
You guess which hand adds up closest to nine.

106
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,550
我当过国际间谍  芬奇
I was an international spy, Finch.

107
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,180
我知道怎么玩百家乐
I know how to play baccarat.

108
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,930
天牌九点  庄家赢
A natural nine. Banker bet wins.

109
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,280
你害我关节炎都发作了
You make my arthritis flare up.

110
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,910
真遗憾  卢  明天好运点
Sorry, Lou. Better luck tomorrow.

111
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,910
看来他是常客  芬奇
Sounds like he's a regular, Finch.

112
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,020
也许卢在维纳斯赌场输得太多了
Maybe Lou has lost too much money at the Venus Casino.

113
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,900
我们得查查他的财政状况
We should look into his finances.

114
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,810
第二天  没发现威胁
Day two. No sign of a threat.

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,490
谁会想伤害个老人呢
Who would want to hurt an old man anyway?

116
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,900
不管卢以前如何  现在都就剩一张嘴了
Whoever Lou used to be, he's all bark now.

117
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,670
快点  快点  我等到花儿都谢了
Come on, come on. I'm growing roots here.

118
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,790
黑进卢的银行账户了吗
Any luck hacking Lou's bank account?

119
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,240
他没有网上账户
He has no online access.

120
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,270
我不得不黑进整间银行
I'm having to hack his entire bank.

121
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,090
我进去了
I'm in.

122
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,240
看来卢的金库要空了
And it looks like Lou's coffers are nearly empty.

123
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,820
他妻子死时他几乎花光了一切
He withdrew almost everything at the time of his wife's death.

124
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,410
之后就一直依靠社保为生
He's been living on social security ever since.

125
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,700
他用不属于他的钱在赌
If he's gambling money he doesn't have,

126
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,540
可能是陷入高利贷的麻烦了
he could be in trouble with loan sharks.

127
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,510
修表匠没戴表
A watch repairman without a watch

128
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,210
也没戴婚戒
and no wedding ring.

129
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,610
也许他把值钱的东西都卖了
Maybe he had to pawn off all their valuables.

130
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,340
看来赌瘾
Seems likely that a gambling addiction

131
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,830
是威胁来源
is the root of the danger.

132
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,830
芬奇  我以前见过卢这种手
Finch, I've seen hands like Lou's before.

133
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,880
手指全断过
All of his fingers were broken.

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,880
我猜  很久以前在大西洋城
My guess, a long time ago in Atlantic City,

135
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,970
他惹怒过黑手党
he could have rubbed the mob the wrong way.

136
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,460
-卢  -凯利
- Lou. - Kelly.

137
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,510
简直像在往我的坟墓里倒
It's like you're pouring me into my grave.

138
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,480
这个新品  喝起来像泥
This new stuff, it tastes like mud.

139
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,410
总有一天  卢  我要把你
One day, Lou, I am gonna throw you

140
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,600
从前门扔出去
right out the front door.

141
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,380
面对现实吧  凯利  我缠定你了
Face it, Kelly, you're stuck with me.

142
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,950
我变鬼都混在这里
My ghost is gonna haunt this booth

143
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,350
赖到这餐馆化成灰为止
until the diner crumbles to the ground.

144
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,480
怎么了  出什么事了
What? What? What's the matter?

145
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,350
有人向老板开价买这块地
The owner got an offer on the place.

146
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,330
那个赌场暴发户  马克里斯
That flashy casino guy, Makris,

147
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,820
-要扩建停车场什么的  -上帝啊
- wants overflow parking or something. - Oh, God.

148
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,670
你告诉他
Well, you tell him--

149
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,440
你告诉他  先过了我这关
you tell him he's got to go through me.

150
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,920
我告诉他哪儿停他那些该死的车
I'll show him where to park his damn cars.

151
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,330
我似乎有发现了  里瑟先生
I may have found something, Mr. Reese.

152
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,910
《纽约日报》上卢结婚启事的档案
Lou's Wedding Announcement in an archival copy of the New York Journal.

153
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,030
在1972年
1972.

154
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,730
有什么有用的
Anything useful?

155
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,100
看来是玛里琳的一位朋友把她交给新郎的
Seems that a friend of Marilyn's gave her away at the wedding.

156
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,100
{\an8}这应该是新娘父亲的工作

157
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,470
如果卢跟黑手党有牵连
If Lou was involved with the mob,

158
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,450
也许她的父母不同意婚事
her parents might not have approved.

159
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,320
我去请卡特查一下
I'll ask Carter to look into it.

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,140
我去探探卢的负债情况
I'll try to determine the extent of Lou's debts.

161
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,680
也许是他以前的赌债找上门了
It may be that his gambling past is coming back to haunt him.

162
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,640
卢・米切尔的名字出现在七十年代的
Lou Mitchell pops up in Jersey organized crime records

163
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,010
泽西集团犯罪记录中  颇受了罪
in the 1970s, got his ass handed to him.

164
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,010
赌债和被捕让他惹上了黑手党人
Gambling debts and arrests got him in trouble with some wise guys.

165
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,930
那些黑手党人现在还管着那里吗
You know if those wise guys still run that part of town?

166
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,490
没了  都老黄历了
Nah, they're ancient history.

167
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,120
不过现在更糟了
But it's even worse these days.

168
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,090
维纳斯赌场毒品问题泛滥
A lot of drug problems around the Venus Casino.

169
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,330
缉毒组的说他们正在调查
Narcotics tells me they're looking into the guy

170
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,330
那里的老板
who runs the place.

171
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,000
-谢了  舍曼斯基  -没问题
- Thanks, Szymanski. - You got it.

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,950
卡特  这是你要的斯蒂尔斯警探的受惩报告
Carter, I got that disciplinary report you wanted on Detective Stills.

173
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,200
就有普通的滥用权力
It's just your garden variety abuse of power.

174
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,820
谢了  铁尼
Thanks, Terney.

175
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,890
没问题
You got it.

176
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,080
乔丝
Joss.

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,190
比彻警探
Detective Beecher.

178
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,530
我在想
So I was thinking,

179
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,800
既然我们去欧文岛的路上你没开枪打我
since you didn't shoot me on the way out to Owen Island--

180
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,090
那这样吧  过来
Yeah, you know what? Uh, come on.

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,140
也许这就是你默许
Then maybe that's your way of saying

182
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,130
我带你去"爱之屋"
I should take you to Il Cuore.

183
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,790
阳台桌如何
Table on the terrace?

184
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,660
-让我想想好吗  -想快一点
- Can I think about it? - But think quick.

185
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,860
我定了周五的位子
I made us a reservation Friday night.

186
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,190
与此同时
In the meantime,

187
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,850
也许你能帮我查间赌场
maybe you can help me look into this casino.

188
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,100
里瑟先生  我看你回到赌场了
Mr. Reese, I see you've returned to the casino.

189
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,070
-卢上赌桌了吗  -马上要上了
- Is Lou at the tables? - He will be soon.

190
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,600
干什么呢  他都没钱了
To do what? He has no money.

191
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,830
一千五
$1,500.

192
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,510
跟他刚用支票换好的那堆筹码说去
Tell that to the wad of bills he just forked over to the cashier.

193
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,080
看来卢的债台更高了
Looks like Lou's going further into debt.

194
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,710
赌场会用会员卡来锁定老顾客
The casino attracts regular gamblers through a loyalty card system.

195
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,350
如果我们获取到卢的
If we could access Lou's,

196
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,440
应该就能查清他的赌博史
it would have information on his entire gambling history.

197
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,950
有办法黑入那个系统吗
Any way you can hack into the system?

198
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,840
从昨天就开始试了
I've been trying since yesterday.

199
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,350
赌场在安保方面颇费心思
Casinos invest heavily in their security,

200
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,330
防火墙有点棘手
and their firewalls are of the tricky sort.

201
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,400
不过阿喀琉斯之踵永远存在  那就是他们的贪婪
But every Achilles has a heel, and theirs is greed.

202
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,520
他们的视频二十一点游戏是联网的
Their video blackjack game is connected to the internet

203
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
好让在线用户也能输钱进去
so that online users can lose money too.

204
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,270
我现在正在跟你对玩
I'm playing against you right now.

205
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,060
你玩儿得不好噢
You're not doing very well.

206
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,080
赢不是目的
Winning is not the goal.

207
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,180
这游戏一心希望我去玩
The game is so eager to let me play

208
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,400
我的恶意程序可以趁机溜进去了
that it's allowed my malware to slip through.

209
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,480
提醒我千万别跟你过不去  芬奇
Remind me never to cross you, Finch.

210
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,280
别跟我赌  破坏运气
Don't bet against me. Bad luck.

211
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,550
我想你能守住的
I think you could hold your own.

212
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,940
查查这个人的身份  芬奇
I'm sending you someone to ID, Finch.

213
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,500
这人一幅当家作主的样子
Guy acts like he owns the place.

214
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,110
他就是  达里恩・马克里斯
Indeed he does. Darien Makris.

215
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,680
在当地小有名气  他是赌场的老板
Bit of a local celebrity. He owns the casino.

216
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,090
卡特警探提醒我注意他
Detective Carter put him on my radar.

217
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,610
警方正在调查他贩卖可卡因的事
The police have been looking into him for cocaine distribution,

218
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,010
但他从未被起诉
but he's never been charged.

219
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,410
天啊  真遗憾
Jeez, I'm sorry.

220
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,640
看来我真的破坏了你的运气
Looks like I did ruin your luck.

221
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,020
有没有试过我们的老虎机
Listen, have you tried our slots?

222
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,220
来吧  我给你免费转一下
Come on, I'll give you a free spin.

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,950
埃里克会带你过去
Eric here will point you in the right direction.

224
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,910
好了  我获取保安权限了
Okay, I've given myself security access,

225
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,390
只要卢把卡一插
so as soon as Lou swipes his card,

226
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,740
我就能远程查看他的历史了
I should be able to view his history remotely.

227
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,430
里瑟先生  卢差不多每天输两千
Mr. Reese, Lou's lost nearly $2,000 a day

228
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,870
连续六个月了
for the last six months.

229
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,060
总数超过32万了
Over $320,000 and counting.

230
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,730
一个只有死收入的人怎么能欠这么多债
How does someone on a fixed income accrue that kind of debt?

231
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,310
真正的问题是  卢到底是
The real question is, how the hell did Lou

232
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,410
怎么弄到这些钱的
get all that money in the first place?

233
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,310
卢肯定是借钱赌博想还债
Lou must be borrowing money to gamble himself out of debt.

234
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,000
他的运气坏得史无前例
And since he has the worst luck I've ever seen,

235
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,610
这样情况只会更糟
he's only going to make his situation worse.

236
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,430
但钱是从哪里来的呢
But where is the money coming from?

237
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,620
你得去查查他的老赌友
You should check into his old gambling pals,

238
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,510
看是不是有人出资
see if anyone is staking him.

239
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,640
你想过没
Has it occurred to you,

240
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,050
也许卢自己就是黑帮份子
what if Lou was a mobster himself?

241
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,820
什么  躲起来的老黑手党吗
What, an old Mafioso in hiding?

242
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,610
我当然希望并非如此
I certainly hope that's not the case.

243
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,020
我去盯他
I'll keep an eye on him.

244
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,730
芬奇
Finch...

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,380
如果他很危险
if he's dangerous--

246
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,000
我拒绝相信一个老人
I refuse to believe that that old man

247
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,620
能伤害到别人
is capable of hurting anybody.

248
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,680
他脾气是不好  但他不是杀人犯
He's cantankerous, but he's not a killer.

249
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,490
给舍曼斯基打开二号审讯室
Open up interrogation two for Szymanski.

250
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,580
走
Let's go.

251
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,730
-舍曼斯基  -卡特
- Szymanski-- - Carter...

252
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,320
-有人要陷害我  栽赃了证据  -什么
- Somebody's trying to set me up. They planted evidence. - What?

253
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,400
海外账户  迈阿密公寓
Offshore accounts. A condo in Miami.

254
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,780
然后内务部在我房间的枕头里找到那东西
Then IAB finds this stuffed in a pillow in my apartment.

255
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,830
这是内务部的事
This is an Internal Affairs matter.

256
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,430
这是个好警察  到底怎么回事
And this is a good cop. What is going on here?

257
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,940
我们收到可靠线报  结果是真的
We received a reliable tip that turned out to be right.

258
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,230
线报  谁的
A tip? From who?

259
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,310
缉毒组有人从线人处听说的
Somebody in narcotics got word from a CI.

260
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,310
走吧  舍曼斯基
Let's go, Szymanski.

261
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,260
我今天本来要出庭作证  卡特
I'm supposed to testify today, Carter.

262
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,450
他们抹黑我让我无法上庭
They're dirtying me up to keep me off the stand.

263
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,420
法官  彼得・约格洛夫领导俄罗斯黑帮
Judge, Peter Yogorov runs the Russian Mafia.

264
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,640
他正因谋杀受审
He's on trial for murder.

265
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,570
明显是他栽赃了证据
Now obviously he had that evidence planted.

266
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,300
这是赤裸裸的干扰证人
It's clear-cut witness tampering.

267
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,930
我要申请延期到舍曼斯基警探可以作证
Now I plead a continuance until Detective Szymanski can testify.

268
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,960
-我一小时后把他带回  -好的
- I'll have him back in an hour. - All right.

269
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,840
约格洛夫先生  听说地检官失去了起诉你的关键证人
Mr. Yogorov, I heard the ADA lost her key witness in your trial.

270
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
你真幸运啊
Lucky you.

271
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,600
-你他妈是谁啊  -去兜兜风吧
- Who the hell are you? - Let's take a ride.

272
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,250
约格洛夫先生
Mr. Yogorov...

273
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,780
我想我们可以相互帮助
I believe we can help each other.

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,700
你们是HR  是吧
You're HR, yes?

275
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,780
我听说你们完蛋了
I heard you guys were finished.

276
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,260
你听错了
Well, you heard wrong.

277
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,310
我还听说没人能见到老大
I also heard no one's ever seen the boss.

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,060
舍曼斯基警探是你案子的关键
Detective Szymanski is key to your case.

279
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,230
他逮捕了你  检查了犯罪现场
He did the arrest, processed the crime scene.

280
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,780
不过现在他的证词要受到严格检查了
But now his testimony is under scrutiny,

281
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,890
他碰过的东西都要受到质疑了
and everything he's touched is in question.

282
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,630
彼得  我们可以让你和你弟弟
Peter, we can make sure that you and your brother

283
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,740
再也不用接受审判  坐进大牢
never see the inside of a courtroom or jail cell again.

284
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,920
代价呢
In exchange for what?

285
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,460
幕后操纵需要钱
Pulling strings costs money.

286
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,340
我们需要现金  就这么简单
We need cash, plain and simple.

287
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,820
你救我们回家  就成交
You get us back home, we have a deal.

288
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,060
我得说  我没感觉跟踪卢有什么困难
I must say, I'm not finding Lou difficult to tail at all.

289
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,350
也许我应该考虑从事特工职业
Perhaps I should have considered a career in the clandestine arts.

290
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,690
你那面运气如何
Any luck on your mission?

291
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,720
我刚和泽西这边
I just had a little chat with some

292
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,030
有头有脸的混混们聊了下
of the more notable lowlifes here in Jersey,

293
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,330
他们说卢黑帮里的老朋友都已经死了
and they say that all Lou's old mob buddies are dead.

294
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,200
被谋杀吗
Murdered?

295
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,170
自然死亡  卢是唯一还活着的
Natural causes. Lou's the last man standing.

296
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,190
卢的财政状况呢
What about Lou's finances?

297
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,480
他欠了犯罪组织或是高利贷的钱吗
Is he in debt to any criminal outfits or loan sharks?

298
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,580
至少这些人没听说
Not as far as these guys have heard.

299
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,330
看来我们又回到原点了
Guess that puts us right back where we started, huh?

300
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,580
里瑟先生  我认为卢的事
Mr. Reese, I think there may be more to Lou

301
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,880
另有隐情
than meets the eye.

302
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,610
事实上  我觉得我们在赌场见到的很多赌徒
In fact, I think there may be more to many of the gamblers

303
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,340
都另有隐情
we saw at the casino.

304
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,640
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

305
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,230
他们中好几个今天也出现在了药店
Several of them are also here at the pharmacy.

306
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,300
而且很奇怪
And it does seem strange

307
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,210
卢连续两天都来取药
that Lou would pick up prescriptions two days in a row.

308
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,650
我觉得需要找个专家帮我们挖掘一下
I think I'll task an expert to help us do a little digging.

309
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,820
我也去挖掘一下
I'll do some digging too.

310
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,940
不是吧
Come on, man.

311
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,400
那家药店归狮木公司所有
The pharmacy is owned by Lionwood Enterprises.

312
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,550
是家我从没听过的皮包公司
It's a shell company if I've ever heard of one.

313
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,970
皮包公司  谁的
A shell? For whom?

314
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,820
有几位董事会成员
There are several board members,

315
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,130
但可巧都联系不到
but they're all conveniently unreachable.

316
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,290
我查了公司的税单
I looked into the tax paperwork,

317
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,900
有一位合伙人不在公开名单上
and there's one partner left off the public listing.

318
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,480
你知道达里恩・马克里斯这名字吗
Does the name Darien Makris mean anything to you?

319
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
知道  谢谢  陶先生
It does, indeed. Thank you, Mr. Tao.

320
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,370
你真是帮了大忙
You've been wonderfully helpful.

321
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,600
你跟着我到处转
You're gonna tail me around town,

322
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,250
至少该有胆介绍下自己吧
at least have the stones to introduce yourself, huh?

323
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,220
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

324
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,440
我帮你拿
I got it.

325
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,410
坐吧
Sit.

326
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,750
你叫什么
What's your name?

327
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,620
哈罗德・奎尔
Harold Quail.

328
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,180
那哈罗德  你能告诉我
So, Harold, you wanna tell me

329
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,280
为什么今早我离开家后你就一直跟着我吗
why you've been following me since I left my house this morning?

330
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,790
我是国税局的  米切尔先生
I'm with the IRS, Mr. Mitchell.

331
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,070
我正在调查维纳斯赌场
I'm looking into the Venus Casino.

332
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,480
希望可以问你几个问题
I was hoping to ask you a few questions.

333
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,270
-我有什么麻烦吗  -跟我没有
- Am I in trouble? - Not with me.

334
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,270
但我有理由相信你需要帮助
But I have reason to believe that you might need some help.

335
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,720
你从哪弄来那么多钱的
Where did you get all the money?

336
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,400
想从我这得到答案  你得自己赢
You want answers out of me, you have to earn them.

337
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,760
百家乐
Baccarat.

338
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,350
每局一个答案
One answer per hand.

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,380
就我看来  米切尔先生
From what I've seen, Mr. Mitchell,

340
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,650
你的运气不怎么好
you're not that lucky.

341
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,420
那对你可是好事  赌吧
Well, this should go well for you. Bet.

342
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,240
玩家
Player.

343
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,720
玩家7点  庄家9点
7 on player, 9 on banker.

344
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,710
太遗憾了
Too bad.

345
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,460
看来你欠我一个答案
Looks like you owe me an answer.

346
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,520
你为什么觉得我需要帮助
Why do you think I need help?

347
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,390
你过去六个月输了32万美元
You've lost $320,000 in the last six months.

348
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,990
我觉得你债台高筑了
I imagine you are in very serious debt.

349
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,800
不  不  行规
No, no, no. House rules.

350
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,070
我发牌
I'm dealing.

351
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,260
庄家
Banker.

352
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,190
真倒霉
Oh, tough luck.

353
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,450
你怎么知道我没那么多钱
How do you know I'm not independently wealthy?

354
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,240
因为我看了你的税务和信用报告
Because I've seen your taxes and your credit reports.

355
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,160
玩家
Player.

356
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,720
你今天不顺啊  哈罗德
This is not your day, Harold.

357
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,920
又输了
You lose again.

358
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,580
怎么
What?

359
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,450
你以为我出千吗  哈罗德
Are you calling me a cheater, Harold?

360
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,620
没人喜欢输不起的人
No one likes a sore loser.

361
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,750
米切尔先生  我确信你处于极度危险中
Mr. Mitchell, I believe that you may be in grave danger.

362
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,130
让我帮助你
Let me help you.

363
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,760
当人们需要帮助时  都会想  "找国税局"
When people need help, they think, "Call the IRS."

364
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,670
这家伙付账
This guy's got the check!

365
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,040
米切尔先生  请听我说
Mr. Mitchell, please, I...

366
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,170
给你  亲爱的
Here you go, hon.

367
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,290
谢谢
Thank you.

368
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,650
喜欢海鲜吗
Hey, you like seafood?

369
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,260
钓吧
Go fish.

370
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,250
天啊
Oh, dear.

371
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,200
看到卢了  芬奇
Got eyes on Lou, Finch.

372
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,630
不过你在哪儿
But where are you?

373
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,160
我决定回图书馆了
I decided to return to the library.

374
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,960
决定
Decided?

375
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,470
卢甩掉你了  是吧
Lou gave you the slip, didn't he?

376
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,640
他把我的钥匙扔进了满是甲壳类的鱼缸里
When he deposited my keys in a tank full of crustaceans,

377
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,990
我深感
I got the distinct impression

378
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,940
他不喜欢被跟踪
that he didn't appreciate being followed.

379
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,730
而且  里瑟先生
And, Mr. Reese,

380
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,740
卢在赌场外运气要好多了
Lou is much luckier outside the walls of the casino.

381
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,710
我认为他在维纳斯赌场是故意输
I think he's throwing those games at the Venus,

382
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,060
但我想不出他为什么要故意输掉自己的钱
but I can't imagine why he would intentionally lose his own money.

383
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,060
你不喜欢老虎机吗
Didn't you like the slots?

384
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,180
不  你知道那东西就是在不断重复
No, you know, it's the same old thing over and over again.

385
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,580
我还是在桌上试试手气吧
I thought I'd try the tables.

386
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,910
里瑟先生  那个头发蓬松的女士
Mr. Reese, that lady with the bouffant,

387
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,470
她输的速度和卢一样
she's losing money at the same rate Lou is.

388
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,340
-然后呢  -她输的时间更长
- So? - She's been doing it longer.

389
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,330
已经输了40万零5千了
She's down $405,000.

390
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,530
那个喜欢用美黑油的女士
And the woman with the fondness for tanning oil,

391
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,310
输了26万1千
$261,000.

392
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,240
这些人都跟卢一起出现过
All of these people that we see with Lou,

393
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,920
他们都输了相当多的钱
they've lost enormous sums of money.

394
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,450
这绝不是巧合
That's more than a coincidence.

395
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,450
他们这么做肯定另有原因
There must be a reason why they're doing that.

396
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,770
你认为他们也是故意输的
You think they're losing intentionally as well?

397
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,370
为什么
Why?

398
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,920
也许我们该问问那个同时拥有赌场和药店的人
Perhaps we should ask the man who owns both the casino and the pharmacy.

399
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,010
维纳斯崛起:  达里恩・马克里斯  大西洋城的新星

400
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,390
马克里斯
Makris.

401
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,430
如果警方是对的  马克里斯在贩毒
If the police are right and Makris is running a drug operation,

402
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,970
那他就需要洗钱
he needs to launder dirty money.

403
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,770
他用老年市民来运钱
He's using senior citizens as couriers.

404
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,040
他们每天在牌桌上把钱输掉
They lose the money at the tables,

405
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,030
通过赌场的现金池洗钱
and it gets laundered into the casino's cash pool every day.

406
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,000
警方绝对不会怀疑到
The police wouldn't think twice about

407
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,120
在赌场里输钱的老年人
old people losing money at a casino.

408
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,860
你知道还有什么警方永远不会怀疑到吗
You know what else the police would never suspect?

409
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,520
去抓处方药的老年人
An old person picking up a prescription.

410
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,470
芬奇
Finch...

411
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,930
那个药房是个秘密传递点
the pharmacy is a dead drop.

412
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,270
马克里斯有一批稳定的运钱者
Makris has got a whole stable of money mules

413
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,910
给他运送现金
transporting cash for him.

414
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,420
他们可不是毒贩
These aren't exactly drug lords.

415
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,550
可以肯定  是马克里斯逼他们的
Safe bet, Makris is forcing them to do this.

416
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,930
但只出现了卢的号码
But Lou's is the only number that came up.

417
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,750
为什么他的处境比其他人要危险
Why is he in more danger than the others?

418
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,590
可能因为他在偷藏这笔非法资金
Maybe because he's skimming off the laundered money.

419
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,000
如果马克里斯发现了
And if Makris has found out,

420
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,890
我想他为了保住自己的钱不惜杀人
I bet he'd kill anyone to protect his investment.

421
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,850
舍曼斯基警探
Detective Szymanski,

422
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,250
你前晚见过安东尼・马可尼吗
did you talk to Anthony Marconi two nights ago?

423
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,450
-没有  绝对没有  -没见过
- No. Absolutely not. - No?

424
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,740
那你们上次会面是什么时候
Then when was the last time you guys talked?

425
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,310
上次我见到这家伙的时候
The last time I talked to that guy,

426
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,980
他的手下开枪打了我
his men shot me.

427
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,330
这是白费劲
It's bad business.

428
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,100
卡尔  那个舍曼斯基的线报来自缉毒组
Cal, the tip came in from narcotics about Szymanski.

429
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,680
你知道是谁打的电话吗
Do you know who made the call?

430
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,180
乔丝
Look, Joss--

431
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,390
是你吗
It was you?

432
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,480
你的线人是谁
Who's your CI?

433
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,820
你知道我不能告诉你
You know I can't tell you that.

434
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,720
去你的不能说
Like hell you can't.

435
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,860
你以为我愿意扳倒另一位警察吗
You think I enjoy taking another cop down?

436
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,090
证据会说话
The evidence speaks for itself.

437
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,600
那我们就什么好说的了
Then I guess there's nothing else to say.

438
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,160
-卡特  -什么事
- Hey, Carter. - Yeah.

439
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,670
我打电话给斯蒂尔斯在51局的上司
I called one of the guys Stills reported to at the 51st--

440
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,000
我们等会再谈行吗  铁尼
Can we talk later, Terney?

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,500
行行
Sure, sure.

442
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,400
好的  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

443
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,650
有件事你得跟我说实话
I need you to tell me the truth about something.

444
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,250
没有圣诞老人  是你父母扮的
There's no Santa. It was your parents.

445
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,400
严肃点  弗斯科
I'm serious, Fusco.

446
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,130
关于比彻的事
It's about Beecher.

447
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,500
你听说过他的事吗
Have you ever heard anything about him?

448
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,630
卡特  你我联手抓住了很多黑警
Carter, you and I put a bunch of dirty cops away.

449
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,240
但相信我  HR没完蛋
But trust me on this, HR's not gone.

450
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,160
活蹦乱跳着呢
Not by a long shot.

451
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,930
谁都可能是其中一员
Anybody could be on the take.

452
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,140
要说比彻的话  我不清楚
As far as Beecher, I don't know.

453
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,030
但如果你从舍曼斯基的赃款着手
But if you follow that money they found on Szymanski,

454
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,530
也许会有意外收获
you might not like what you find.

455
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,020
你今天筹码输得可真快啊  卢
You burned through those chips fast today, Lou.

456
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,370
你简直是要我命啊  詹  要我命了
You're killing me, Jen, killing me.

457
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,680
明天好运点
Better luck tomorrow.

458
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,700
老东西  你要的爆米花给你拿来了
Hey, old man. Got that popcorn you wanted.

459
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,440
-别挡路  -对不起了  老爷子
- Out of my way. - Sorry, gramps.

460
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,250
你一直在偷藏老板的筹码
You've been skimming from the boss.

461
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,390
我们得赶紧离开这
We gotta get you away from here.

462
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,860
你可以相信我  我是跟
You can trust me. I'm with--

463
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,700
哈罗德一起的
Harold?

464
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,210
是  我猜到了
Yeah, I figured.

465
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,820
我猜你们不是国税局的吧
So I guess you're not really with the IRS, huh?

466
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,870
有这么明显吗
Is it that obvious?

467
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,830
我想你欠哈罗德几个答案
Now I think you owe Harold some answers.

468
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,050
是啊
Yeah.

469
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,930
能告诉我你到底是谁吗
You want to tell me who you really are?

470
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,790
这并不重要
That's not important.

471
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,380
但我说想帮你时
But when I said we want to help you,

472
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,470
是真心话
that was the truth.

473
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,850
你为什么给马克里斯做事
Why are you working for Makris?

474
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,630
我的玛里琳得了癌症
My Marilyn got cancer.

475
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,350
已经是晚期
Really advanced.

476
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,370
我们唯一的希望是一种干细胞疗法
Only hope we had was a stem cell treatment.

477
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,770
我们的积蓄远远不够
We didn't have enough to cover it.

478
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,170
我不得不想法凑钱
I had to improvise.

479
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,850
所以你去了赌场
So you went to the casino.

480
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,670
我之前说对了  是吧
I was right, wasn't I?

481
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,780
那是在侮辱我的技术
That's like calling a white truffle athlete's foot.

482
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,860
我可是大西洋城最牛逼的老千
I'm the best damn card mechanic in Atlantic City.

483
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,510
所以你弄到了钱
So you got the money.

484
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,590
对  也进行了治疗
Yeah, and the treatment.

485
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,420
但有时运气会用光
But sometimes, your luck just runs out.

486
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,000
玛里琳去世没多久
A few days after Marilyn passed,

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,740
马克里斯拿到了一份老千的旧名单
Makris got his hands on an old list of card sharps.

488
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,390
你的名字在那名单上  他找上门
He saw your name on the list, and he came around,

489
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,450
让你还钱
asking for his money back,

490
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,740
但你肯定早花光了
but of course you didn't have it.

491
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,440
所以他拿走了你的婚戒
So he takes your wedding ring

492
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,360
和玛里琳的首饰作为抵押
and Marilyn's jewelry as collateral,

493
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,480
然后逼你帮他洗钱
and he puts you to work laundering money.

494
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,940
说是只要干几个月
Said it would just be a couple of months.

495
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,020
但我感觉一辈子都别想脱身
I get a feeling this is a lifetime gig.

496
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,580
所以你开始偷藏吗
So is that why you started skimming?

497
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,180
他让我输的我都输了
I lose everything he tells me to,

498
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,650
为什么我就不能赢回一点点
so what if I win a little back?

499
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,780
明显马克里斯可不这么想
Clearly Makris sees it differently.

500
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,330
卢  我不会让他再追杀你
Lou, I'm not going to let him come after you ever again.

501
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,430
是么
Yeah?

502
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,550
与此同时
In the meantime,

503
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
你最好出城避避风头
it would be best if you left town.

504
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,260
这是车票和钱  足够让你过得舒适
Here's a ticket, enough money to keep you comfortable.

505
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,450
在芝加哥给你准备了很棒的住处
There's a lovely place waiting for you in Chicago.

506
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,850
我不能离开玛里琳
I can't leave Marilyn.

507
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,650
我的墓地就在她旁边
There's a plot for me right next to her.

508
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,480
刻好了名字  什么都准备好了
It's got my name on it and everything.

509
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,000
卢  我理解
Lou, I know exactly

510
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,480
被迫抛下一个人的痛苦
how difficult it is to have to leave someone behind.

511
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,200
你也失去过
You lost someone too?

512
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,440
我必须继续生活
I had to move on.

513
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,870
你也是
So must you.

514
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,290
四十年前  黑手党抓住我出千
40 years ago, the mob caught me sharping.

515
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,350
揍了我个半死  打断了我的全部手指
Beat me all to hell, broke all my fingers.

516
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,010
扔下我等死
Left me for dead.

517
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,370
一名女服务员在餐馆后面的垃圾堆里发现了我
A waitress found me in a dumpster behind the diner.

518
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,490
玛里琳
Marilyn.

519
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,090
我已经绝望了
I was ready to give up.

520
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,530
是她给了我活下去的动力  你明白吗
But she gave me something to live for, you know?

521
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,780
为了她  我放弃了赌博
Because of her, I gave up gambling.

522
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,780
而这双手则用来修理手表
I used these hands to fix watches instead.

523
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,180
她拯救了我  哈罗德
She saved me, Harold.

524
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,770
而现在她希望你拯救你自己
And she'd want you to save yourself now.

525
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,820
芝加哥一定很冷
Chicago will be cold.

526
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,660
不用担心  卢
Don't worry, Lou,

527
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,290
我的同伴会让马克里斯相信
my associate will make sure Makris thinks

528
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,550
你已经死了
you've been eliminated.

529
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,010
你觉得我还有可能回来吗
So you think I'll be able to come back?

530
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,100
也许吧  总有机会
Maybe. Eventually.

531
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,190
我这把年纪  没太多机会了
At my age, there's not much eventually left.

532
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,130
卢现在安全了
Lou's safe for now,

533
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,750
但马克里斯会穷追不舍
but Makris will never stop looking for him.

534
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,830
他知道太多内幕
He knows too much.

535
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,000
而且我们也不能把其他
And we can't abandon all the other

536
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,990
被马克里斯控制的老人弃之不顾
elderly people under Makris's thumb.

537
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,100
我们有没有能把他定罪的证据
Do we have the evidence to put him behind bars?

538
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,910
不幸的是  没有
Unfortunately, no.

539
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,190
洗钱的人都有两套账
Money launderers keep two sets of books.

540
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,520
交给国税局看的假账
The cooked numbers you show the IRS,

541
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,720
还有记录违法所得的真账
and the real books to keep track of your extralegal gains.

542
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,810
现在
At the moment,

543
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,240
我拿不到那些账本
those books are beyond my reach.

544
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,310
怎么才能让你拿到呢
Well, what would we need to get them within your reach?

545
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,890
分散注意力
A distraction.

546
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,940
这边请  先生
Here you are, Sir.

547
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,870
谢谢
Thank you.

548
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,110
那里还有个钢管舞杆
There was a stripper pole in that thing.

549
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,420
我认为太堕落了
I feel weirdly grimy.

550
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,720
这家伙贩毒吗
So this guy's dealing drugs?

551
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,020
这么说还算好听的
That's putting it mildly.

552
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,060
根据我看到的财务信息
Based on the financial information I've seen,

553
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,610
他的洗钱所得大概在八位数
he's laundering profits on the order of eight figures.

554
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,480
羡慕啊
I'm jealous.

555
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,540
是义愤  义愤填膺
Angry. I'm angry.

556
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,320
必须阻止他
He must be stopped.

557
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,110
没错  所以  你现在是杰森・鲍
Indeed. Ergo, you are now Jason Bao,

558
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,560
花花公子  百万富翁
playboy millionaire.

559
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,200
欢迎来到维纳斯赌场  鲍先生
Welcome to the Venus, Mr. Bao.

560
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,050
-谢谢  先生  -这边请
- Thank you, Sir. - Right this way.

561
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,550
大赌家开始下大注的时候
When a high roller starts betting big,

562
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,910
马克里斯和他的保安就会开始关注
Makris and his security pay attention.

563
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,670
他们都在看你  就没人注意我们了
If they're all looking at you, they won't be watching us.

564
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,240
到了  就是这里
That's it, right up here.

565
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,230
这儿多少钱
How much is this?

566
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,790
一百万美元  如您所愿
$1 million, as you requested.

567
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,190
能上一些龙舌兰酒吗
Can we get some tequila shots, please?

568
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,300
马上就来
Right away.

569
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,450
一百万
A million?

570
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,260
你放心把这么多钱交给里昂吗
You trust Leon with that much of your money?

571
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,340
绝对不放心  不过做生意总得先投资
Absolutely not, but I'm afraid it's the cost of doing business.

572
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,200
祝你好运
Good luck.

573
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,140
运气  那可不够  里瑟先生
Luck? Merely a construct, Mr. Reese.

574
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,610
找到赌场服务器了  很快就好
Found the casino's servers. This shouldn't take long.

575
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,100
至少让里昂开心一下
Let Leon have a little fun at least.

576
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,560
芬奇  你不是送卢出城了吗
Finch, I thought you sent Lou out of town.

577
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,410
是的
I did.

578
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,170
送得不够远  他又回来了
Well, not far enough. He's back.

579
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,080
好像他把偷藏的筹码全赌上了
And it looks like he's gambling every chip he's ever skimmed.

580
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,250
玩家赢
Player bet wins.

581
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,750
他知不知道自己在干什么
Does he have any idea what he's doing?

582
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,280
马克里斯以为他死了
Makris thinks he's dead.

583
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,180
马克里斯肯定不会高兴看见一个死人
Makris is not gonna like it when he sees a dead guy

584
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,420
在赢他的钱
winning his money.

585
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,830
有人想跟你说句话  现在
Someone would like a word, now.

586
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,780
我会还给你车票钱的
Look, I'll pay you back for the ticket.

587
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,660
卢  我们正在获取马克里斯的私人文件
Lou, we're accessing Makris's personal files

588
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,590
想要找到能给他定罪的证据
in search of the proof we need to put him away.

589
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,080
我们不能分出精力来同时保护你
We can't do that and protect you at the same time.

590
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,960
我发过誓  哈罗德
I made a promise, Harold,

591
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,020
向玛里琳发的誓  就在她死前
to Marilyn, right before she passed.

592
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,140
她抓住我的胳膊  她知道我在想什么
She grabbed my arm. She knew what I was thinking.

593
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,150
我在想  或许我应该跟她一起去
That--that maybe I'd, you know, join her.

594
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,430
她对我说  她救我一命
And she told me she didn't save my life,

595
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,170
不是为了让我虚度生命
so I could throw it away.

596
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,730
你没有
And you haven't.

597
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,840
洗毒品黑钱  那种生活吗
Laundering drug money? That's living?

598
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,070
现在一逃了之
And now to just run away?

599
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,210
不不  我要从他口袋里拿回我放进去的每一分钱
No. No, I'm taking back every dime I put in his pocket.

600
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,280
求你了
Please.

601
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,780
我不想到死都是输家
I don't want to die a loser.

602
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,020
很好
Very well.

603
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,170
如果我们要做  就得做好
Then if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.

604
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,490
我觉得你可以从马克里斯手里赢走不止32万
I think you can take Makris for more than the 320,000.

605
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,030
但要想赢大钱  就得下大注
But to win big, you have to bet big.

606
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,790
我出资
So I'm staking you.

607
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,230
你最好像你说的那么厉害
And you'd better be as good as you say you are.

608
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,650
两百万美元  米切尔先生  祝您好运

611
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,420
你得跟紧他

芬奇  我们出来了  芬奇
Finch, we're out. Finch?

他叫这个名字吗
Is that his name?

648
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,250
我们找到了你的朋友  芬奇

分不清真假可开不了赌场
You can't run a casino without being able to spot a fake.

I was gonna do this quietly,

但现在我们要找点乐子了
but now we're gonna have some fun.

卢  那天可真是惊喜啊
Lou, I had such a nice surprise the other day.

654
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,200
一个发牌员告诉我你的好运终于来了
A dealer told me that your luck had finally turned.

655
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,520
你揣走了500美元
You walked away $500 up.

656
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,510
那时我才发现  你一直在偷藏
And that's when I realized you've been skimming.

657
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,510
在我眼皮子底下顺走了好几万
Tens of thousands of dollars, right under my nose.

658
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,060
听我说
Listen--

659
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,490
你只要去输钱就行  老东西
All you had to do was lose, old man.

660
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,330
在你死之前
So before you die,

661
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,770
我会让你明白
I'm gonna make you realize

662
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,230
你就是个输家
that you are a loser.

663
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,850
你永远都是
And that's all you're ever gonna be.

664
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,240
你喜欢玩游戏是吗  卢
You like games, right, Lou?

665
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,920
俄罗斯轮盘是我的最爱
Roulette's my favorite.

666
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,850
你的对手只有左轮手枪
It's just you versus the wheel.

667
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,480
你或许能逃过一两发
You may skate by for a spin or two.

668
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,960
但最终  赢的永远是庄家
But in the end, the house always wins.

669
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,200
我把钱全都还给你  别
I'll give you all the money back, just don't--

670
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,240
别这样  住手
Just stop this. Just stop it.

00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,550
他没事
Oh, he's safe.

672
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,360
暂时的
For now.

673
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,250
拜托  你得救我啊
Come on, man. You gotta save me.

674
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,450
这是你的活儿
That's your thing!

675
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,740
也不是他
Not him either.

676
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,630
胜率越来越小了啊
The odds are getting worse.

677
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,200
有时运气会用光
Sometimes your luck just runs out.

678
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,470
笨蛋
Hey, dumbass...

679
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,700
我出千了
I cheated.

680
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,790
我也不是说还在为凯蒂哭泣
It's not like I'm still crying over Candi.

681
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,010
但每次都这样  你懂不
But it's always the same story, you know?

682
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,640
找到一个喜欢的女孩
You find a girl you like.

683
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,730
又高挑  又漂亮
She's tall, she's pretty,

684
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:16,060
结果却是有人花钱雇她把你铐在床上
and it turns out someone paid her to handcuff you to a bed,

685
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,110
想杀死你
so they could murder you.

686
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,290
向来如此
Same old story.

687
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,470
我得学学保护自己了
I gotta learn to protect myself.

688
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,700
或许像你们这样  保护别人
Maybe protect other people like you guys.

689
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,400
听起来不错
That sounds like a great plan.

690
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,530
我升华了  兄弟
I'm turning over a new leaf, dude.

691
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,220
什么
What?

692
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,010
救人要花钱的啊
Saving people costs money!

693
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,910
卡特
Carter.

694
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,150
匆匆忙忙干什么
What's the rush?

695
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,130
我认为舍曼斯基是被陷害的
I think Szymanski was set up.

696
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,470
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

697
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,450
弗斯科  你说要从赃款着手是对的
Fusco, you were right about following the money.

698
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,120
知道内务部在舍曼斯基家发现的那些做了标记的钞票吗
You know those marked bills IAB found in Szymanski's place?

699
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,780
联调局把钱安排在了以利亚的一家杂货店里
Well, the FBI placed them in a bodega run by Elias.

700
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,620
六天后  纽约警方突击了那里
Six days later, NYPD did a raid there,

701
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,000
但那些标记钞票没被收进证物
but the marked bills never showed up in evidence.

702
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,490
而是失踪了
They just disappeared.

703
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,690
要么是以利亚挪走了那些钱
So either Elias moved the money

704
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,830
要么就是队里有人拿走了
or someone on the force grabbed it,

705
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,790
给了HR一个陷害好警察的绝佳手段
giving HR a perfect way to set up a good cop.

706
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,840
卡特  警察工作做到家了
Carter, that's real police work.

707
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,070
这足够让内务部放开他了
That should be enough to get IAB off his back.

708
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,700
绝对能在今天之内把他保释出来
It was definitely enough to get him out on bail by the end of the day.

709
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,120
还能让他出庭指证约格洛夫一伙
And it should let him testify against the Yogorovs.

710
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,700
卡特
Carter.

711
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,920
卡尔・比彻来电

712
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,150
怎么
Yeah?

713
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,620
这意味着有人要害舍曼斯基
This means someone does have it out for Szymanski.

714
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,220
你也要多加谨慎
You watch your back.

715
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,360
你也不想下一个轮到你
You don't want them turning on you next.

716
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,220
卡尔・比彻来电

717
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
谢谢
Thank you.

718
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,520
我知道你赢来的钱都会被作为证据
I understand your winnings are tied up as evidence.

719
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,490
没事  无所谓
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

720
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,850
只要能把马克里斯关进监狱
As long as it keeps Makris locked up.

721
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,370
你说谎时的表情还得再练练
You know, your poker face needs work.

722
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,420
那笔钱你另有打算
You had plans for that money.

723
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,900
我知道你为什么要偷藏那些钱
I figured out why you skimmed all that cash,

724
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,320
想用来买什么
what you wanted to buy.

725
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,800
买什么
What's that?

726
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,640
餐馆
A diner.

727
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,050
那就是你和玛里琳  对吧
That's you and Marilyn, isn't it?

728
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,170
是的  四十年来这里就像我们的家
Yeah, this place was a home to us for 40 years,

729
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,270
但店主总是威胁说要关掉
but the owner kept threatening to shut it down.

730
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,480
我想这里继续
I wanted to keep it alive.

731
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,730
现在马克里斯的开价没戏了
But now that Makris's offer is off the table,

732
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,600
问题解决了
problem solved.

733
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,260
直到再有人开价
Until another offer comes along.

734
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,530
是啊  没有什么是永恒的
Yeah, well, nothing lasts forever.

735
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,890
我一直想找个人看看这个
I've been meaning to have someone look at this.

736
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,260
价值两百万美金的表
That's a $2-million watch.

737
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,600
原来是  不幸的是  我踩了一脚
It was. Unfortunately, I stepped on it.

738
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,450
但如果有人愿意修修
But if someone was interested in repairing it...

739
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,340
知道吗  你妻子  你失去的那个人
You know, your wife, the one you lost.

740
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,120
她失去了一个好男人
She lost a good man.

741
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,070
她现在正在天上对你微笑呢
She's smiling down on you right now.

742
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,600
等等
Wait.

743
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,730
难道她没死
You mean she's not dead?

744
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,450
对于一个天才来说  你就是个白痴
You know, for a genius, you're an idiot.

745
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,760
太迟了  卢
It's too late, Lou.

746
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,680
你还没咽气  就不迟
You're still breathing. It's not too late.

747
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,070
去找她  哈罗德
Go to her, Harold.

748
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,430
就今天  趁你还有时间
Today, while you still have time.

749
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,030
你还好吗
You all right?

750
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,640
我听到卢对你说的话了
I heard what Lou said to you.

751
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,960
你有在听吗
You were listening?

752
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,390
永远在
Always.

753
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,380
你这么做是为了她的安全  哈罗德
You did what you had to do to keep her safe, Harold.

754
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,010
卢不明白
Lou doesn't know that.

755
