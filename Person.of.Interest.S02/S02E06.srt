我仔细查看了他的工作经历
I took a closer look at his employment history.

162
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,960
看不出他怎么会有钱搬到东部
Hard to see how he had the money to move east,

163
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,930
何况还要支撑城市生活的费用
much less, support a city lifestyle.

164
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,680
也许他遇到了一位隐型富豪
Maybe he met a reclusive billionaire?

165
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,710
其实他没遇到
In the event that he didn't,

166
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,270
我给韦恩堡那边打了几个电话
I made a few phone calls around Fort Wayne,

167
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,790
自称是系谱学家调查家谱图
claiming to be a genealogist working on a family tree.

168
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,130
然后查到了一条有趣的记录
And I did uncover one record of interest.

169
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,250
什么记录
And what's that?

170
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,090
他的死亡证明
His death certificate.

171
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,300
真正的格雷汉姆・惠勒死于1997年
The real Graham Wyler died in 1997.

172
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,360
{\pos(132,83)}讣告

173
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,360
{\pos(127,170)}格雷汉姆・惠勒

174
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,760
你跟踪的这人偷了他的身份
Whoever you've been following stole his identity

175
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,710
并一直盗用了15年
and has been using it for the past 15 years.

176
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,070
借尸还魂
He's ghosting.

177
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,530
以死人的名义活着
Built a life on a dead man's name.

178
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,950
不如先别管这个人
Might be better if we were less concerned

179
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,870
现在的身份
with who this man is,

180
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,760
重点查清他过去的身份
and more concerned with who he was.

181
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,850
下午好
Afternoon.

182
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,210
以前没见过你
I haven't seen you around here before.

183
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,990
刚来的吗
You new in town?

184
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,470
只是路过
Passing through, actually.

185
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,180
很遗憾  路过不够快
Unfortunately, not fast enough.

186
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,760
这里禁止停车
You're in a no parking zone.

187
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,960
就警告一下行吗
Any way you could let me off with a warning?

188
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,520
要我动用小额备用金支付吗
So shall I pay this out of petty cash?

189
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,930
在郊区跟踪比在城市里难多了
Harder to tail someone in the suburbs than in the city.

190
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,650
听说了
I heard.

191
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,100
你"西装男"那套玩不转了
Your man-in-the-suit routine doesn't exactly play.

192
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,720
正巧
As it happens,

193
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,870
有幢精致的三居室别墅
there's a quaint three-bedroom

194
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,010
刚刚开始出售
that's just gone on the market

195
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,360
正好位于惠勒家对面
across from the Wyler's home.

196
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,460
你可以明天搬进去
You can move in tomorrow.

197
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,630
搬进去
Move in?

198
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,010
你们会成为邻居
You're gonna be neighbors.

199
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,180
我还买了一辆新车
I also procured a new vehicle,

200
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,330
一套合适的行头
an appropriate wardrobe,

201
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,720
一套高尔夫球具
and a set of golf clubs.

202
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,430
伪装身份还有个关键元素
There is one element of your cover

203
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,290
你得自己搞定
that you'll have to acquire on your own.

204
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,410
约翰
John.

205
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,160
真遗憾  听说你跟那位记者
I'm sorry to hear that it didn't work out

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,800
玛克辛没成
with that reporter Maxine.

207
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,200
我会没事的
I'll get over it.

208
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,130
其实我在想
I was actually thinking...

209
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,890
我们应该多聚聚
we should spend a little more time together.

210
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,010
是吗
Is that so?

211
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,920
这次是怎么回事
What is it this time?

212
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,790
更强大的玩家  更复杂的伪装
More power players or cover-ups?

213
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,700
也不算
Not exactly.

214
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,220
佐伊・摩根
Zoe Morgan...

215
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,360
做我的妻子好吗
will you be my wife?

216
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,260
搬家公司

217
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,730
记得那次你曾救我
Remember when you saved me

218
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,230
免遭雇佣杀手的折磨和杀害吗
from being tortured and killed by corporate hit men?

219
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,190
这下我们扯平了
Consider us even.

220
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,220
这么说你不想我
That mean you don't want me

221
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,710
抱你进门了吗
to carry you across the threshold?

222
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,610
等这一切结束
When this is over,

223
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,220
我没准儿会和你争夺狗狗的抚养权
I might have to fight you for custody of the dog.

224
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,040
已经开始想我了吗  哈罗德
Miss me already, Harold?

225
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,730
其实  我是想感谢摩根女士
Actually, I wanted to thank Ms. Morgan

226
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,550
提供专业帮助
for offering her services.

227
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,070
神秘的郊区老爸
Suburban dad with a mysterious secret?

228
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,560
怎么抗拒得了
How could I resist?

229
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,000
再说  得有人看着约翰
Plus, somebody had to see to it

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
免得他炸掉整条街
that John didn't burn down the block.

231
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,630
我们等着瞧吧
We'll see what happens.

232
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,490
现在  重点是确定惠勒的身份
Right now, our main concern is to ID Wyler,

233
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,300
查出他到底是谁
figure out who he really is.

234
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,240
想到变成惠勒好友的办法了吗
Any ideas on how to become the Wyler's new best friends?

235
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,150
想到几个
A few.

236
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,890
我会去拜访惠勒的店
I'll visit Wyler at his store,

237
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,850
告诉他我们刚刚搬到对门
tell him we just moved across the street.

238
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,570
一旦有了交集
Once we've established contact,

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
我们就能引导他们家来
we'll be able to manipulate the family into--

240
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,770
约翰  只是门铃
John, it's a doorbell.

241
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,670
不要第一天就来个枪杀女童军  可以吗
Let's try not to shoot any girl scouts on our first day, okay?

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,330
很抱歉打扰你们
Sorry to bother you.

243
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,520
只是想过来
Just wanted to stop by

244
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
欢迎一下新邻居
and welcome you to the neighborhood.

245
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,050
-我是康妮・惠勒  -格雷汉姆
- I'm Connie Wyler. - Graham.

246
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,230
约翰・坎贝尔
John Campbell.

247
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,230
{\an8}美国科幻小说黄金时代的开山鼻祖

248
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,610

It's nice to meet you both.

250
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,380
给你们做了点吃的
I made you guys some ambrosia.

251
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,770
盘子可以有空再还
Just bring the dish back anytime.

252
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,150
我们就住对门
We're right across the street.

253
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,090
看起来真美味
This looks delicious.

254
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,370
下午大家都过来一起烧烤
We're having some people over this afternoon for a barbecue.

255
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,750
有空的话你们也过来吧
You should stop by if you're not busy.

256
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
我们会去的
Well, we'll be there.

257
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,310
太好了  下午见
Great. See you then.

258
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,510
挺容易嘛
That was easy.

259
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,820
谢谢
Thanks.

260
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,800
我早就注意到你的车了
Couldn't help but notice your car earlier.

261
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,160
太漂亮了
Thing of beauty.

262
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,650
花了你多少钱
How much she set you back?

263
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,070
其实是公司的车
Actually, it's a company car.

264
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,550
天  我肯定是入错行了
Man, I must have picked the wrong business.

265
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,760
你做什么工作
What do you do?

266
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,000
销售私人安防系统
I sell private security systems.

267
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,350
家用的  公司用的
Homes, offices.

268
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,760
如果你感兴趣的话
You know, if you're interested,

269
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,820
有些设备我可以给你不错的折扣
I could get you a great deal on some equipment.

270
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,650
不用了谢谢
No thanks.

271
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,720
我属于守旧派  玩不转高科技
Kind of old-school, low-tech.

272
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,160
我刚加固了家里门和窗户上的锁
I reinforced the locks on my doors and windows.

273
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,030
住在这里  有这些就足够安防了
That's pretty much all the security you need around here.

274
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,380
看来你心里很有数
Sounds like you've got it all figured out.

275
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,970
就是不知道怎么增加店内客流
Except how to get people into my store.

276
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,430
真是越来越难
It's getting harder and harder

277
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,710
跟大型连锁店竞争了
to keep up with the big box chains.

278
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,550
老实人辛苦谋生却无人欣赏
No one appreciates an honest man trying to make a living.

279
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,900
敬这句话
I'll drink to that.

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,410
你俩住在洛克威多久了
How long have the two of you been living in Rockaway?

281
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,980
差不多十年了
Oh, about ten years.

282
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,770
我母亲生病后我和格雷汉姆就搬过来了
Graham and I moved here after my mother got sick,

283
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,990
想帮上点忙
so we came out to help.

284
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,240
你们呢
What about you guys?

285
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,720
你怎么认识约翰的
How did you meet John?

286
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,720
我被困在了...
I was, um, stranded...

287
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,880
城里的危险地区
in a bad part of town.

288
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,650
他带了我一程
And he gave me a ride.

289
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,540
然后我们整晚都在城里
And we actually spent the rest of the evening

290
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,480
游车河
running around the city.

291
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,930
约翰让我想起了当年的格雷汉姆
Oh, you know, John kind of reminds me of Graham,

292
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,070
我们刚到这的时候  有点安定不下来
when we first moved out here, kind of restless.

293
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,750
别担心  他会静下来的
Don't worry, he'll calm down.

294
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,690
再来瓶酷乐酒吗
Another Wine Cooler?

295
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,650
来杯曼哈顿怎么样
What about a Manhattan, up?

296
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,750
怎么调
How do you make that?

297
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,800
-来  我做给你看  -好的
- Come on, I'll show you. - Okay.

298
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,210
爸  你看到我的项链了吗
Dad, have you seen my necklace?

299
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,140
修好后就没见过
No, not since I fixed it.

300
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,510
如果你破天荒地整理下房间
If you cleaned your room once in a millennium--

301
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,840
我继续去找
I'll keep looking for it.

302
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,140
我们在费城有什么熟人吗
Who do we know in Philadelphia?

303
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,280
没  从没去过  怎么了
No one, never been there. Why?

304
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,740
有张明信片
This postcard came.

305
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,370
天啊  好可爱
Oh, my Gosh! He's adorable.

306
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,220
真招人喜欢
Oh, you're so cute!

307
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,280
{\pos(146,161)}惠勒家收
洛克威市桃花街2828号

308
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,440
乖宝贝噢
Who's a good boy?

309
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,280
你能替我烤会儿吗
Would you mind manning the grill for a moment?

310
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,100
当然
Sure.

311
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,410
惠勒被什么东西吓到了
Wyler's spooked about something.

312
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,890
他隐藏的事  没告诉任何人
Whatever he's hiding, he kept it from everyone.

313
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,800
康妮一无所知
Connie's in the dark.

314
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,320
看看我们能不能查清点什么
Let's see if we can shed some light, then.

315
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,010
你有化妆刷吗
You got a makeup brush?

324
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,530
卡特
Carter.

325
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,260
能帮我查个指纹吗
You think you can run a print for me?

326
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,220
又发现坏人了
You find another bad guy?

327
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,890
正在努力发现中
That's what I'm trying to find out.

328
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,240
这人看上去不像坏人啊
That guy doesn't look so bad.

329
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,050
至于指纹  期望值别太高
As for the print, I wouldn't hold your breath.

330
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,920
只是部分指纹
It's a partial.

331
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,920
从费城查起吧
Start with a search in Philadelphia.

332
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,270
我们不会要飞去费城  是吧
We're not getting on a plane to Philly, are we?

333
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,870
目前不用
Not at the moment.

334
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,240
现在干嘛
What now?

335
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,750
等着
We wait.

336
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,680
你都来了  热闹还会远吗
The party never stops when you're around.

337
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,440
这里的人都找什么乐子呢
What do these people do for fun?

338
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,280
问倒我了
Beats me.

339
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,820
有什么主意吗
Got any ideas?

340
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,850
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Boom boom boom boom ?

341
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,590
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? I'm gonna shoot you right down ?

342
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,800
郊区生活也没那么糟嘛
Suburbs might not be so bad after all.

343
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,780
跟不跟呢  亲爱的
In or out...dear?

344
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,820
我几时临阵脱逃过
Ever known me to run from a fight?

345
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,640
一对A
Pair of aces.

346
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,820
两对
Two pair.

347
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,690
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? And walk that walk ?

348
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,620
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? And walk that walk ?

349
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,400
来杯柠檬水吗  先生  50美分
Lemonade, sir? 50.

350
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,600
给您
Here you go.

351
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,390
昨晚休息得好吗  里瑟先生
Have a good night's rest, Mr. Reese?

352
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,890
估计比惠勒好点
Think I fared better than Wyler.

353
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,010
他看上去疲惫不堪
He looks exhausted.

354
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,870
你今早给车换机油了吗
Did you change the oil in the car this morning?

355
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,730
没  我忘了  抱歉
No, I forgot. Sorry.

356
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,010
你没事吧
You okay?

357
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,910
没事  我很好
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

358
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,980
抱歉了  劳埃德
Sorry about that, Lloyd.

359
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,490
你认识那人吗
You know that guy?

360
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,360
不  他肯定是把我错认成别人了
No, he must have confused me with someone else.

361
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,620
你听到了吗  芬奇
You hear that, Finch?

362
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,950
似乎不只是认错人
Sounds like more than a case of mistaken identity.

363
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,070
神秘男跟个朋友一起走了
Mystery man just took off with a friend.

364
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,960
可能就是寄明信片给惠勒的人
Could be the same men that sent Wyler the postcard.

365
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,930
我想他们可不是来城里叙旧的
Something tells me they're not in town for a reunion.

366
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,070
警探
Detective.

367
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,390
找到那家伙了
I found your guy.

368
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,090
他被捕过一次
He was only arrested once,

369
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,220
罪名是91年的一次非法入侵
for a misdemeanor B&E, back in '91,

370
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,530
不过他因以一系列抢劫案和非法入室被通缉
but was wanted for a string of robberies and home invasions.

371
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,980
他是职业大盗
He was a career thief.

372
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,190
我觉得费城警察肯定
I'm sure Philly PD would love

373
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,560
想找他谈谈
to have a talk with him.

374
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,000
我猜猜
Let me guess.

375
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,400
他叫劳埃德
First name's Lloyd.

376
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,070
劳埃德・普鲁特
Lloyd Pruitt.

377
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,750
你怎么知道的
How'd you know?

378
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,120
蒙的
Wild guess.

379
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,430
他有同伙吗
Did he work with a crew?

380
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,060
对  有两个
Yeah, a couple other guys.

381
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,470
克里斯・沃恩和丹尼尔・伯恩赛德
Chris Vaughn and Daniel Burnside.

382
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,220
他们干得相当顺手
They had a good run

383
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,180
直到97年抢劫珠宝店被捕
until they got caught taking a jewelry store in '97.

384
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,400
入狱12年
Did 12 years.

385
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,830
我猜那位劳埃德没干那一票
I guess your guy Lloyd missed that job

386
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,760
或者在被捕之前逃跑了
or disappeared before they got picked up.

387
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,860
他忙着化身格雷汉姆・惠勒
He was busy becoming Graham Wyler,

388
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,720
洗白背景
giving himself a clean slate.

389
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,280
他离开得正是时候
He picked a good time to run.

390
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,020
他们被捕的那票抢劫案中
That job they got busted on,

391
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,700
沃恩对一名手无寸铁的保安开枪
Vaughn shot an unarmed guard.

392
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,850
他是危险分子
He's dangerous.

393
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,110
感谢帮忙  卡特
Thanks for your help, Carter.

394
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,610
干得漂亮
Good job!

395
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,800
-你踢得真好  -谢谢妈
- Good play out there. - Thanks, mom.

396
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,560
芬奇  沃恩在这里
Finch, Vaughn's here.

397
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,930
我去找他聊聊
I'm gonna have a few words with him.

398
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,250
不是吧
No way!

399
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,470
那是谁的车
Whose car is that?

400
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,210
等等  站远点
Wait. Stay back.

401
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,500
来电显示被屏蔽

402
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,300
车真不幸啊  劳埃德
Sucks about the car, Lloyd.

403
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,190
不过很高兴今天能撞见你
Nice running into you today, though.

404
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,880
我们出来喝一杯如何
Why don't we grab a drink?

405
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,770
城里那家撞墙酒吧
The Wallbanger, in the city.

406
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,090
明天下午
Noon tomorrow.

407
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,890
我们有些事儿要办
We've got some catching up to do.

408
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,710
芬奇  看来惠勒的过去阴魂不散啊
Finch, looks like Wyler's past has come back to haunt him.

409
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,640
你可以通过手机来访问
You'll have access to all the camera feeds

410
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,620
所有的摄像头
through your cell phone.

411
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
那这个警报器
And this alarm system,

412
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,420
它会向警局报案吗
does it call the local police?

413
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,460
不不不
No-no, no.

414
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,090
信号会发送给一个私人行动队
It sends a signal to a private response team.

415
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,500
你做得对
You're doing the right thing.

416
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,230
康妮还没从车着火的事里缓过来
Yeah, Connie's still shaken up about the car fire.

417
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,020
依我们看  可能是些孩子干的
And for all we know, it could be a couple of teenagers.

418
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,590
怎么样了  哈罗德
How are we doing, Harold?

419
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,410
马上就好  老板
Almost finished, boss.

420
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,130
好了  如果惠勒的老伙计试图闯入
Okay, if Wyler's old crew attempt to gain access to the house,

421
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,670
我们会看见
we'll see them coming.

422
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,520
沃恩很聪明
Vaughn's been smart so far.

423
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,580
警察在车上找不到证据
Cops couldn't find the evidence on the SUV

424
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,540
证明是犯罪行为
to point to a culprit.

425
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,550
说到沃恩  我梳理了他的档案
Speaking of Vaughn, I combed through his files.

426
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,930
他们那伙人做的每票案子里
In each of the jobs that he and his crew have pulled,

427
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,230
保险箱都是用一种
a safe was cracked

428
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,340
叫做"锁操纵"的技术打开的
using a technique called "lock manipulation."

429
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,510
不用钻孔  不用工具
No drilling, no tools.

430
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,120
只用耳朵听
All of it done by ear.

431
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,090
这是种失传的绝技
This is a lost art.

432
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,950
但是在最后一票抢劫时
But in the last heist,

433
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,490
情况有所不同
there was a difference.

434
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,090
沃恩开枪打了保安
Vaughn shot the guard

435
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,320
逼着珠宝店的经理打开保险箱
to motivate the jewelry store manager to open the safe.

436
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,740
就是惠勒缺席的那次
The one job Wyler didn't show up for.

437
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,620
他是开锁人
He was the safecracker.

438
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,050
最后那票没参加
Bailed on the last job.

439
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,930
他们把失手被捕归罪于他
They blame him for getting locked up.

440
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,880
这点他们今天下午会面时
A detail they'll, no doubt, remind him of

441
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,210
绝对会提醒他的
when they meet this afternoon.

442
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,190
宝贝  你在吗
Honey, you in here?

443
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,710
我刚挂了保险公司打来的电话
So I just got off the phone with the insurance company.

444
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,130
他们说调查员最早也要
They say they can't send an investigator out

445
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,070
下周才能过来
till next week.

446
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,100
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

447
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,900
我要去店里取点东西
I need to go get something for the store.

448
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,620
好的  稍等一下好吗
Okay, well, hang out for a second, okay?

449
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,560
他们说要想拿到赔偿金就
They say they can't cover the cost of a rental...

450
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,330
先别管了
It can wait!

451
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,610
好吗
All right?

452
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,870
听着
Look...

453
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,010
我必须走了  好吗
I need to go, okay?

454
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,550
我们以后再解决行吗
Can we handle this later?

455
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,230
我自己能解决
I can handle it myself.

456
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,800
不过打几个电话罢了
It's a couple of stupid phone calls.

457
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,970
你怎么了
What's going on with you?

458
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,300
没什么需要操心的
Nothing you need to worry about.

459
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,730
格雷汉姆  你要是认为
Graham, if there's something going on

460
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,240
有什么事不能告诉我
you think you can't tell me,

461
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,460
别那么想
get over it.

462
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,880
不管发生什么  我们都一起承担
Whatever it is, we'll figure it out together.

463
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,450
我几个钟头就回来
I'll be back in a few hours.

464
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,940
格雷汉姆  你要去哪
Graham, where are you headed?

465
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,370
赶去城里的火车
Catching a train into the city.

466
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,900
我正好要去见个客户
I'm meeting a client there.

467
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,710
带你一程吧
Let me give you a lift.

468
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
节约点时间
Save you some time.

469
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,430
谢了
Thanks.

470
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,770
适应平静的生活需要点过程
Quiet life takes some getting used to.

471
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
不合你的节奏吧
Not your speed, huh?

472
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,370
好多做私人安防的
You know, a lot of guys in home security

473
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,750
以前都在执法部门工作
used to be in law enforcement.

474
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,700
你以前是警察之类的吗
Were you a cop or something?

475
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,870
我不是
Not me.

476
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,900
规则太多
Too many rules.

477
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,240
打破规则的感觉更好
Always had more fun breaking them.

478
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,520
我们早晚要长大的  是吧
Guess we all got to grow up sometime, right?

479
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,200
那时真没想到我也会
Certainly never thought I would.

480
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,530
怎么变了
What changed?

481
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,160
自己
Me.

482
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,970
以前只需照顾自己
Used to just look out for myself.

483
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,700
现在要照顾康妮和伊西
Now I look out for Connie and Izzy.

484
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,350
为了她们我不惜一切
Nothing I wouldn't do for them.

485
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,560
看来惠勒的过去
Seems that Wyler's past

486
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,020
威胁到的不仅是他的生命  还有他的婚姻
threatens not only his life but his marriage as well.

487
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,910
我去去就回
I'll be back.

488
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,420
我从没见过他如此生气
I've never seen him angry like that.

489
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,620
可能他只是事情太多了
He's probably just got a lot on his mind.

490
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,110
你知道的  车子还有
You know, with the car and the--

491
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,250
不是这样的
It's not that.

492
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,950
自我认识他以来
The whole time I've known him,

493
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,170
格雷汉姆向来遇事不慌  胸有成竹
Graham has always been the one with the solution.

494
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,850
但今天  我简直都不认识他了
But today, I didn't even know who that was.

495
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,470
我还没问过你们是怎么认识的
You know, I never asked you how you two met.

496
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,850
我们在新泽西的斯普林斯汀演唱会上相遇
We met at a Springsteen concert in Jersey.

497
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,540
有个变态不停调戏我
This creep wouldn't stop hitting on me.

498
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,890
格雷汉姆就突然出现了
And suddenly Graham appeared.

499
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,680
我以前从没见过他
I'd never seen him before,

500
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,510
不过他假装是我的男友
but he pretended to be my boyfriend

501
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,090
好赶走那个变态
so the other guy would go away.

502
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,340
我只能说
And I could just tell

503
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,970
他身上有些与众不同的地方
there was something different about him.

504
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,500
那一瞬间足以改变一生
That one moment changed your whole life.

505
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,680
是啊
Yeah.

506
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,600
你和约翰相遇时也是这种感觉吗
Is that what it was like when you first met John?

507
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,000
老实说
I can honestly say

508
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,040
没有他我今天不会在这里
that I wouldn't be here without him.

509
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,540
很难找到可以依靠的人
It's rare to find someone you can depend on.

510
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,130
准备好开玩了吗
Ready to have some fun?

511
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,520
你很擅长将人们
You're good at connecting people

512
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,370
和他们不想揭露的事情联系起来
to the things they don't want the world to know.

513
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,110
你又有多擅长
How good are you at finding connections

514
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,370
发现无人所知的联系呢
that no one knows exists?

515
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,810
告诉我那两个人的关系
Try to tell me if there's a correlation

516
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,640
那个牛仔和的士司机
between the cowboy and the taxi driver.

517
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,780
五代表亲
Fifth cousins?

518
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,780
真的吗
Really?

519
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,290
我们还真是身处大熔炉啊
We do live in the great melting pot.

520
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,610
好吧
Okay.

521
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,810
另外两个人的关系
What's the association

522
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,700
这名跑步者和
between this jogger and--

523
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,160
又是她
It's her again.

524
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,900
你在格蕾丝・亨德克斯身上发现什么有意思的吗
So you've found something interesting on Grace Hendricks?

525
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,370
没有
No?

526
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,120
那她和公园里其他人有没有关系
Then is she connected to anyone else in the park?

527
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,630
我还以为修复成功了
I thought I fixed this.

528
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,660
这女人的生活中你没发现任何异常
You haven't found a single anomaly in this woman's life.

529
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,650
她诚实  正直
She's honest, decent,

530
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,880
似乎没有任何不可告人的秘密
doesn't seem to have any dark secrets.

531
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
对任何人都没有恶意
Doesn't harbor ill will toward anyone.

532
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,720
这正是她与众不同的地方
Which is what sets her apart from everyone else here.

533
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,420
还有对查尔斯・狄更斯的热爱
That and a passionate love for Charles Dickens.

534
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,830
我在这里打车就好
I can take a cab back from here.

535
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,360
谢谢你载我来
Thanks for the ride.

536
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,330
不用谢
You're welcome.

537
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,690
换新形象了
Trying a new look?

538
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,940
怀念以前的样子
More like missing my old one.

539
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,390
那些人在里面待了半小时了
Your boys have been in there for half an hour.

540
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,400
他来了  你欠我二十刀
He showed. You owe me 20 bucks.

541
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,390
你们怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

542
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,550
这个说来就有趣了
That is a real fun story.

543
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,000
当时我在工作
I was at work.

544
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,440
刷碗工
Dishwasher.

545
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,440
我这种前科犯只能找到那种工作
Only kind of job a con like me could get.

546
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,210
老板给我看了一张脸书上的照片
My boss shows me this Facebook photo.

547
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,090
他在纽约的崽子
Some babe he's plowing in New York.

548
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,320
我看了
I look.

549
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,350
简直不敢相信我的眼睛
I can't believe my eyes.

550
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,630
劳埃德・普鲁特
There's Lloyd Pruitt...

551
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,060
就站在照片的背景里
standing in the background of this photo.

552
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,600
我久违的朋友
My long lost friend.

553
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,800
神采飞扬
Smiling, laughing,

554
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,770
他漂亮的女儿穿着名牌校服站在他身边
beautiful daughter next to him in her nice school sweater.

555
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,490
你混得真是不错啊  劳埃德
It's a hell of a life you've made for yourself, Lloyd.

556
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,790
希望我也能成天卖锤子
Wish I was spending my days selling hammers.

557
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,670
比在州监狱里蹲12年强多了
Beats 12 years in the Fromhold State Penitentiary.

558
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,990
只有12年吗  感觉好像更久
Was it 12? It felt longer.

559
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,350
是啊  感觉好像50年
Yeah, felt like 50.

560
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,380
这能怪我
That's my fault?

561
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,100
我告诉过你那活儿很危险
I told you the job was dangerous.

562
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,930
但你自认为无所不能
But you thought you were invincible.

563
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,480
所以我才退出的
And that's why I walked.

564
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,210
多高尚啊
How noble.

565
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,790
在我们看来
The way we see it,

566
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,040
你欠我们的
you owe us,

567
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,400
我们来讨债了
and we're here to collect.

568
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,470
就这样吗
So that's it?

569
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,550
你们要为那些陈年往事杀了我
You're gonna kill me over ancient history?

570
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,830
劳埃德  你是最厉害的开锁人
Lloyd, you're the best safecracker we know.

571
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,860
我们干嘛要杀你呢
Why would we want to kill you?

572
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,870
我们要开Everhold牌保险箱
We're gonna break into an Everhold safe.

573
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,800
好活儿
It's a high-road job.

574
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,660
我们需要你的金手指
We need your Midas touch.

575
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,750
实际上  这笔大有赚头
In fact, the score's so big,

576
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,510
事成之后  我们就逃出国
when we're done, we're leaving the country.

577
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,500
所以安排妥你的事
So get your affairs in order.

578
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,780
干嘛我现在不向警方
What's stopping me from going to the cops...

579
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,600
告发你们俩呢
about you two right now?

580
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
你家挺温馨的
It's a lovely home.

581
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,410
下次要拿的  会是跳动中的心脏
Next time we take something with a heartbeat.

582
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,460
你干什么
What are you doing?

583
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,090
他们威胁他的家人
They threatened his family.

584
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,670
我去把他们拿下
I'm taking 'em down.

585
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,960
别这么冲动行吗
Can you take it easy instead?

586
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,670
现在是光天化日  约翰
It's broad daylight, John.

587
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,460
距离我的辖区就两条街
We're two blocks away from my precinct.

588
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,930
这些家伙必须永远消失  卡特
These guys need to go away for a long time, Carter.

589
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,390
那就把他们抓获现行
Then catch them in the act.

590
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,690
现在他们只不过
Right now, all we've got

591
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,100
是在策划抢劫
is conspiracy to commit a robbery.

592
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,770
这还属于非法监听
And that's from an illegal wiretap.

593
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,890
不足以让这些家伙远离惠勒及其家人
It won't be enough to keep them from Wyler or his family.

594
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,250
那我就让他们明白
Then I'll make them understand

595
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,110
他们绝不能靠近他家人
they can never go near his family again.

596
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,700
好吧
Okay.

597
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,020
难道你打算一辈子盯着他的家人
So are you gonna watch this family forever

598
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,080
以确保他们乖乖听话吗
to make sure they listen?

599
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,260
明天  晚上十点
Tomorrow, 10:00 PM.

600
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,270
我们在十字路口接你
We'll pick you up at that intersection.

601
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,090
记得来  劳埃德
Be there, Lloyd.

602
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,970
我塞了个一次性手机在他们卡车上
I slipped a burner phone on their truck.

603
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,300
这样就能追踪他们了
We can track them with it.

604
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,730
一旦他们开始行动
If they make the wrong move,

605
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,670
我们就一网打尽
we'll grab them.

606
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,990
惠勒怎么办
What about Wyler?

607
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,870
他得自己做出决定
He's got a decision to make.

608
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,400
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? It serve you right to suffer ?

609
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,120
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Serve you right to be alone ?

610
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,550
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? It serve you right to suffer ?

611
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,570
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Serve you right to be alone ?

612
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,950
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Because you're still livin' ?

613
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:45,150
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? In days done past and gone ?

614
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:54,980
{\pos(280,219)}康妮

615
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,320
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Yeah ? 

616
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,370
惠勒再过一小时就该跟沃恩会合了  芬奇
Wyler's due to meet Vaughn in an hour, Finch.

617
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,190
如果他入伙了我们怎么办
What are we gonna do if he goes through with the job?

618
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,790
你有什么建议
What do you suggest?

619
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,670
把他的底儿漏出去
We take him out of the equation.

620
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,340
他在费城还被通缉着
He still has open warrants in Philly.

621
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,670
惠勒入狱后
With Wyler serving jail time,

622
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,940
沃恩也无计可施
there's not much Vaughn could do.

623
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,950
这会毁了他的家庭
We'd risk breaking up his family.

624
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,140
他们可能永远不会原谅他
They might never forgive him.

625
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,110
我知道正常人的生活
I know the prospect of a normal life

626
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,910
对我们来说遥不可及  里瑟先生
seems remote to people like us, Mr. Reese.

627
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,550
可惠勒还有机会保住他的生活
But Wyler still has a chance to preserve his.

628
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,810
格雷汉姆  你在吗

629
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,910
格雷汉姆
Graham?

630
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,930
检查监控  芬奇
Check the cameras, Finch.

631
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,200
确认他是否离开了
Make sure he hasn't already left.

632
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,500
里瑟先生  恐怕惠勒已经替我们做了决定
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid Wyler's made our decision for us.

633
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,660
他十五分钟前离开了
He left 15 minutes ago.

634
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,850
避开了家里的摄像头
Avoided his own camera.

635
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,690
他要参与沃恩的抢劫
He's meeting Vaughn for the heist.

636
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,220
他命不长了  芬奇
His number's up, Finch.

637
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,700
一旦他打开了保险箱
When he's done cracking that safe,

638
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,620
沃恩没理由饶他性命
Vaughn's got no reason to keep him alive.

639
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,060
芬奇  我要惠勒的位置
Finch, I need to know where Wyler is.

640
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,190
伯恩赛德的卡车GPS定位在哪里

642
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,970
稍等
Hang on.

643
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,120
在拖吊场
It's an impound lot.

644
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,750
他们在收拾离开
They're pulling up stakes,

645
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,290
抹去所有痕迹
ditching all traces.

646
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,020
保险箱有线索吗
What about tracking the safe?

647
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,730
Everhold虽然保险箱造得好
Everhold may make a quality safe,

648
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,440
但防火墙实在有待提高
but their firewall leaves something to be desired.

649
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,640
我在看他们的客户名单
I'm looking at their client list.

650

曼哈顿有五十多个客户
There are more than 50 of them in Manhattan.

651
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,500
看一下那辆卡车的GPS记录
Roll back the GPS history on the pickup.

652
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,210
沃恩有可能在动手前
Vaughn might have done a drive-by

653
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,970
去目标地点最后踩下点
for final preparations on the job.

654

他们在中城区一家小酒馆前停了四个钟头

他对我有点意思

00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,400
芬奇  我进去之前你能看到那个房间吗
Finch, any way to see into that room before I go in?

667
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,370

所以是的  我们肯定可以利用
So, yes, I'm sure there's something we can exploit.

那就算了  我们快走
that's it then, we're out of here.

757
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,920
你得先打开保险箱
Not till you open that safe.

758
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,420
你还想再进监狱吗
Do you wanna go to jail again?

要是我们留下  你保证能如愿

768
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,940
最好不要
Preferably not.

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,880
要是警察在他逃离前到达
In the event that the police arrive before he escapes...

These guys are getting jumpy, Harold.

775
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,080
有什么办法引开他们的注意力
What do you got in the way of a distraction?

776
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,420
正在设法
I'm working on it.

777
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,130
搞定了
Got it.

778
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,640
果然是金手指
Man with the Midas touch.

779
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,910
我手上拿着价值两千万的蓝榴石
I'm holding 20 million worth of blue garnets in my hand.

780
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,750
我太想念你了  劳埃德
I missed you, Lloyd.

781
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,570
我还真没有同感
Wish I could say the same.

782
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,210
芬奇  该你动手了
Finch, I think that's your cue.

783
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,890
发送音频文件到环绕声系统
Sending an audio file to the surround sound system.

784
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,350
可能会很吵
This might get loud.

785
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
你毁了我的生活
You ruined my life...

786
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,200
为你自己开创了新生活
so you could start yourself a new one.

787
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,760
这样算扯平
This'll square it up.

788
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,250
天啊
God!

789
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,990
你要开枪吗
You gonna shoot me?

790
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,370
太久了
It's been so long,

791
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,620
你大概已经忘了怎么开枪
you probably don't remember how that thing works.

792
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,770
你并不想那么做的
You don't want to do that.

793
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,610
卡特警探  现场指挥官
Detective Carter, on-scene commander.

794
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,470
我盯这伙人一周了  所有人跟上
I've been on this crew all week. Everybody on me.

795
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,280
我们从西侧楼梯上去  明白吗
We're gonna take the west stairwell up, got it?

796
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,240
明白
Got it.

797
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,770
放他走  格雷汉姆
Let him go, Graham.

798
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,100
我不能
I can't.

799
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,310
这一切必须结束
This has to end.

800
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,170
如果你开枪  格雷汉姆・惠勒
If you pull that trigger, then Graham Wyler--

801
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,200
也就是真正的你  会和他一起死去
the man you really are-- dies with him.

802
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,210
他不能再骚扰我的家人
He can't come after my family again.

803
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,330
他不会
He won't.

804
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,890
他会在监狱里度过三十年
He'll spend the next three decades in prison.

805
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,180
但是如果你动手  就会跟他一起进去

806
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,810
康妮该怎么办呢
What's Connie gonna do then?

807
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
我就知道你下不了手
I knew you didn't have it in you.

808
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,690
你一直都是
You were always--

809
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,750
好人
The better man.

810
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,730
{\pos(96,153)}卡特

00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,020
快走
Come on.

812
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,140
出口安全  里瑟先生
Your exit is clear, Mr. Reese.

813
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,190
我在街角的车里等
I'm waiting in a car around the corner.

814
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,180
继续走
Keep moving.

815
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,580
没时间了
There's not much time.

816
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,780
你是谁
Who are you?

817
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,010
带你回家的人
Your ride home.

818
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,710
我留了字条  告诉了她一切
I left a note telling her everything.

819
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,530
我是谁  我做过什么

820
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,210
我能像什么都没发生一样回去吗
I'm supposed to go back like nothing's ever happened?

821
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,870
康妮和伊西能忘记
Connie and Izzy forget

822
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,880
她们所认识的我完全是个假象吗
that everything they know about me is a lie?

823
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,770
并非完全
Not everything.

824
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,910
她们对你的意义  是真的
What they mean to you, that's real.

825
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,090
她们知道
They know that.

826
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,840
那无法改变我的过去
Can't change what I've done.

827
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,400
过去是很难逃避的
The past is a difficult thing to outrun.

828
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,900
也许是时候停止再逃了
Maybe it's time to stop running.

829
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,790
格雷汉姆  你不必非这么做
Graham... you don't have to do this.

830
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,230
我必须
Yeah, I do.

831
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,160
惠勒不再躲藏了  芬奇
Wyler's done hiding, Finch.

832
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,880
他刚刚去自首了
He just turned himself in.

833
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,630
他是决定了要自首
He may have decided to turn himself in,

834
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,380
不过你还是要赶快离开
but you need to get out of there.

835
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,330
惠勒成为了污点证人
Wyler's turning state's evidence

836
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,280
希望能获得减刑
in hopes for a reduced sentence.

837
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,670
看来现在要由法庭来决定什么对他最好了
I suppose now the courts will decide what's best for him.

838
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,090
你好  约翰
Oh, hi, John.

839
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,970
康妮
Connie.

840
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,950
我想和格雷汉姆谈谈
I was wondering if I could talk to Graham.

841
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,890
他告诉我你救了他
He told me you helped him out.

842
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,580
没说怎么救的
Didn't say how.

843
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,670
无论你是如何
But whatever you did...

844
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,720
不用谢
You're welcome.

845
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,800
你要离开了
See you're moving on.

846
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,430
是啊
Yep.

847
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,230
我这种人不适合郊区
Guy like me doesn't belong in the suburbs.

848
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,140
只是来道个别
Just wanted to say good-bye.

849
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,850
我只能停在这里
This my stop.

850
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,930
不像你  我可是真的被钉牢在这里了
Unlike you, I'm stuck here literally.

851
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,880
法官认为我对社会无害
Judge didn't think I was a danger to society,

852
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,530
所以我要用修剪草坪来还债
so I get to pay my debt mowing the lawn.

853
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,940
格雷汉姆
Graham?

854
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,220
洗衣机又有噪音了
The washer's making that noise again.

855
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,420
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

856
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,660
我让她承受了太多
I put her through a lot.

857
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,470
不管什么原因
And for whatever reason,

858
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,230
当我早上醒来时  她还在身边
she's still there when I wake up in the morning.

859
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,830
我想这足以证明什么
Guess that says something.

860
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,680
保重  约翰
Take care, John.

861
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,040
我们现在该离婚了吧
This the part where we get divorced?

862
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,950
真遗憾没成
Sorry it didn't work out.

863
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,720
过程还是挺有趣的
Fun while it lasted though.

864
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,210
是吧
Right?

865
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,400
我们还剩下些威士忌
Well, we still have some Scotch left.

866
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,310
想不想再待一个晚上
Want to stay one more night?

867
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,130
试试把钱赢回去
Try to win some of that money back?

868
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,860
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? It serve you right to suffer ?

869
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,990
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Serve you right to be alone ?

870
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,160
我猜猜  一份香草冰淇淋
Let me guess, one vanilla cone.

871
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,190
是的  谢谢
Yes, please.

872
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,020
就算在一月
Even in January,

873

我也会为你留上几份
I always keep a few of these for when you come by.

874
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,880
我真的那么好预测吗
Am I really that predictable?

875
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,490
不  你只是不愿拒绝小小的乐趣
No, you just don't deny yourself small pleasures.

876
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,470
你大概是第一个这么说我的人
You may be the first person that ever told me that.

877
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,490
这没什么错
Nothing wrong with it.

878
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,980
生命只有一次  对吧
You only live once, right?

879
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,520
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Serve you right to be alone ?

880
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,270
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Because you are still livin' ?

881
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
亨德里克斯  格蕾斯  R

882
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:15,770
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? days done past and gone ?

883
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,780
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Every time you see a woman ?

884
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,260
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? She make you think of yours ?

885
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,990
{\fnDroid Sans Fallback}{\an9}? Every time you see a woman ?

886
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,000
你好
