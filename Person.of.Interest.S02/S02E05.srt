I saw you helping that guy in the suit.

168
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,700
知道我闪过什么念头吗
You know what even crossed my mind?

169
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,100
也许你就是要扳倒我们的内鬼
You might be the rat who tried to take us down.

170
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,900
不过你没有那么傻  没有吧  莱奈尔
But you wouldn't be that stupid, now would you, Lionel?

171
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,560
-没有  -那就好
- No. - Good.

172
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,270
HR虽然被端了  但我们还没出局
'cause HR might be down, but we are not out.

173
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,420
我的老大正在幕后活动
My boss is pulling strings right now

174
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,040
以保住高层
to save the upper management.

175
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,660
有那种朋友  还要我干啥
With friends like that, what do you need me for?

176
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,930
因为联调局不肯停手
Because the FBI keeps digging.

177
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,570
听说他们正在调查一条线索
We got word that they're onto something

178
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,390
能把我们连锅端了
that could still bring us all down.

179
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,550
我  我的老大  也许还有你
Me, my boss, probably even you.

180
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,600
什么线索
What do they got?

181
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,810
何不由你来告诉我
Why don't you tell me?

182
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,320
你的搭档和唐纳利那么铁
Your partner's all buddy-buddy with Donnelly.

183
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,880
所以你要去查明他们在找什么
So you're gonna find out what they're looking for,

184
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,130
然后销毁掉
and you're gonna make it disappear.

185
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,260
要是我不呢
And if I don't?

186
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,860
那就监狱里见吧
well, I guess I'll see you in prison.

187
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,100
你儿子知道你的所作所为
I mean, what's your kid gonna think

188
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,230
会怎么想啊
when he finds out what you did?

189
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,210
你觉得你前妻还会让他再和你见面吗
You think your ex-wife's even gonna let you see him again?

190
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,920
你跟我们一样迫切需要摆脱这些
I mean, you need this to go away as bad as we do.

191
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,010
到了关键时候  谁又会帮你呢
Push comes to shove, who's got your back here?

192
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,170
是你那位自命清高的搭档  还是我
That goody-two-shoes partner of yours or me?

193
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,980
就为我们做这最后一件事  莱奈尔
Just do this one thing for us, Lionel.

194
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,510
然后如果你想退出  就可以退出
Then if you want out, you're out.

主要是我们老大的怒吼
My boss' screaming mostly.

205
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,310
你让我过了水深火热的一天呀
You've made this a very tough day for me.

206
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,620
当你同意为艾德・格里芬那样的骗子
Well, when you sign on as campaign manager

207
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,090
担任竞选经理的时候
for a crook like Ed Griffin,

208
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,950
就该料到会有水深火热的日子
you gotta expect a few tough days.

209
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,590
抱歉
Sorry.

210
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,080
我会挺过去

Right, Max?

213
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,170
私下跟你说
Off the record,

214
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,810
格里芬今年没戏了
it's not Griffin's year.

215
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,260
沃克领先  我找不到把柄可用
Walker's ahead, and I can't find any dirt to save my life.

216
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,310
得了吧  表面越是干净
Come on, the cleaner they are on the outside,

217
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,030
只要深查下去  私底越是腐败
the more rotten they are once you crack them open.

218
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,380
其实我就是来提醒你的
I actually came by just to warn you.

219
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,630
格里芬想整你以立威
Griffin wants your head on a pike.

220
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,210
告诉他排队等着
Well, tell him to get in line.

221
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,180
你听到了吗  芬奇
You hear that, Finch?

222
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,830
艾德华・格里芬  我们的最新嫌疑人
Edward Griffin, our newest suspect

223
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,130
但可能不是最后一个
but likely not our last.

224
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,380
小熊  拜托
Oh, Bear, please.

225
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,470
看  你的球噢
Look, here's your ball.

226
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,720
我应该很快就能进入玛克辛的云储存站点了
I should have access to Maxine's cloud storage site shortly.

227
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,830
一旦进去
Once I get inside,

228
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,570
我会查看她现在正在做的所有工作
I'll scan through everything she's working on,

229
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,580
看看还有谁想要她命
see who else might want her dead.

230
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,530
这不是什么新闻报道  格伦
That's not the real story, Glen.

231
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,360
当然不是  拷了75名警察  这是新闻消息
The hell it's not. 75 cops in cuffs--that's news.

232
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,680
新闻报道不是抓到了谁
The story's not who they busted,

233
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,110
而是没抓到谁
it's who they didn't.

234
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,270
HR的头儿
The head of HR.

235
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,980
联调局知道自己没抓住幕后老大
The FBI knows they don't have the big boss.

236
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,850
现在他们只是四处撒网能抓就抓
And now they're just scooping up everybody,

237
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,240
希望如果网撒得够大就能抓住他
hoping they'll catch him if they cast a wide enough net.

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,970
想写幕后老大吗  那好
Wanna write about the big boss? Fine.

239
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,520
找出是谁  找到证据
Get me a name and something to back it up.

240
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,090
否则  不能刊登
Until then, there's nothing to print.

241
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,160
这么说她是在调查HR的头儿
So she's looking for the head of HR.

242
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,240
我们要查查西蒙斯吗
Should we be looking at Simmons?

243
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,700
我分析了弗斯科警探提供的证据
Actually, my analysis of the evidence from Detective Fusco

244
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,380
其实西蒙斯只是个高级指挥罢了
suggests that Simmons is just a high-ranking lieutenant.

245
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,060
那真正话事的是谁
Then who's really in charge?

246
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,850
有人给玛克辛打电话
Someone's dialing Maxine's cell.

247
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,510

251
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,090
好吧  那是什么
Okay, what is that exactly?

252
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,870
HR的幕后老大  我知道是谁
HR's big boss-- I know who it is

253
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,240
好的  我在听

HR的头儿是克里斯多夫・桑布拉诺

警方今晚就要逮捕他了

256

克里斯多夫似乎很清白
Christopher seems to have kept his nose clean.

263
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,940
这就更方便他
Which would make him

264
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,070
在黑帮和警察之间居中联络
a good liaison between the mob and the police.

265

279
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,010

280
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,570

Okay, this is deep, deep background.

281
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,110

286
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,760
我仍会在报道中隐去你的名字
I'll keep your name out of this story too.

287
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
她好像真的查出东西来了
Sounds like she's really onto something.

288
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,200
我们必须要调查一下桑布拉诺了
We definitely need to check out Zambrano.

289
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,480
我想玛克辛抢我前边了
I think Maxine might beat me to it.

旋转木马部件  是我买来做慈善的
parts of a kiddie carousel, which I bought for charity.

300
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,480
这能上报纸吗  不能
Does that make it into the papers? No.

301
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,910
因为我姓桑布拉诺
Because my last name is Zambrano,

302
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,240
所以你们都觉得我是黑手党
you guys all think I'm a wise guy.

303

不  我觉得你是HR的头儿

我觉得你很清楚我在说什么

从未见过他
Never seen him before.

308
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,270
有意思  门卫看到他来过这里
Funny, 'cause the guard at the gate has seen him here,

309
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,650

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,630
如果你未牵连其中  那要如何解释呢
So if you're not involved, then how would you explain that?

314
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,280
给我闭嘴
Shut your mouth.

315
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,210
我什么都不知道  好吗
I don't know anything about that, okay?

316
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,980
如果你再继续这样问问题
And if you keep on asking questions like this,

317
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,050
会害死人
somebody's gonna get hurt.

318
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,510
这样不行  芬奇  我要过去
I don't like this, Finch. I'm going in.

319
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,510
里瑟  不能过去  玛克辛还在做另一个调查
Reese, you can't. Maxine has another pet story.

320
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,440
她一直在研究警局记录
She's been scouring through police records,

321
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,740
走访目击证人
talking to witnesses,

322
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,220
找一名西装男
hunting for a man in a suit...

323
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,510
就是你
meaning you.

324
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,930
我们是通过秘密政府机器
We're fugitives getting illegal information

325
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,460
获取非法信息的逃亡者
from a secret government machine.

326
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,770
约翰  我们绝对不能公开
John, the last thing we need is publicity.

327
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,790
你要保护安吉拉斯女士
You must protect Ms. Angelis,

328
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,500
但与此同时  还不能让她拿到
but you have to do it without giving her any more proof

329
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,230
西装男存在的证据
that the man in the suit exists.

330
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,210
你以为我会相信
Do you expect me to believe

331
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,180
你敢在你做合法生意的地盘上对我动手
you're gonna lay a finger on me at your legitimate business?

332
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,540
-不准刊登  -桑布拉诺先生
- You don't print that.  - Mr. Zambrano.

333
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
不准写这种文章
You don't write that.

334
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,770
"HR老大嫌疑人袭击记者"
"Suspected HR boss assaults reporter."

335
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,020
你觉得这种标题会减轻你的嫌疑吗
Do you think that headline makes you look less guilty?

336
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,420
泰迪  送这娘们离开我的地盘
Hey, Teddy, escort this bitch off my property.

337
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,040
好吧  芬奇
Okay, Finch.

338
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,340
我要怎样才能救一名
How am I supposed to save a woman

339
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,620
想把我变成头条新闻的女人呢
who wants to put me on the front page?

340
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,930
虽然情况很复杂
Despite this complication,

341
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,410
我们仍必须确保玛克辛的安全
we must focus on keeping Maxine safe.

342
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,810
从桑布拉诺的网络数据资料中
I can't find anything in Zambrano's digital footprint

343
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,600
看不出他是HR的头儿
to suggest that he's the head of HR,

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,220
不过我们也曾被聪明的罪犯骗过
but brilliant criminals have fooled us before.

345
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,860
我非常希望你不要在这里弄这个
I do wish you wouldn't do that here.

346
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,130
在公园弄这个  人家看我的眼神好古怪
When I do it in the park, people look at me funny.

347
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,000
好吧  先假设桑布拉诺是HR的头儿
Okay, let's assume that Zambrano is the head of HR.

348
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,690
他可能想杀掉玛克辛
He might want to have Maxine killed

349
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,390
以免真实身份被她报道曝光
before she can reveal his true identity in the paper.

350
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,350
这也太难了
It would be damn hard

351
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,360
又要阻止他们  还不能让玛克辛看到我
to stop them if I can't let Maxine see me work.

352
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,170
可如果你从天而降英雄救美
And when you step out of the shadows to help her out,

353
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,310
她会知道你就是那个西装男
she's going to know you're the man in the suit.

354
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,190
在想到方法让你光明正大出现之前
Until we can figure out a way to hide you in plain sight,

355
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,870
或许你该先寻求下支援了
perhaps you should enlist some backup.

356
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,410
玛克辛・安吉拉斯  对  我听说过她
Maxine Angelis. Yeah, I've heard of her.

357
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,000
那女人向来刨根问底
That woman leaves no stone unturned.

358
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,210
你在她身边怎么大显神通
How do you expect to work your magic with her around?

359
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,370
你跟你的朋友不是死乞白赖
Aren't you and your friend obsessed

360
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,020
不肯曝光吗
with staying out of the paper?

361
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,730
我会保持距离
I'll keep my distance.

362
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,320
我发的另一张照片是克里斯・桑布拉诺
The other photo I sent you is Chris Zambrano.

363
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,640
玛克辛觉得他是HR的幕后老大
Maxine thinks he's HR's big boss.

364
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,010
这么说他跟他爸一样坏
So he's crooked like his dad, huh?

365
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,060
你没事吧  弗斯科
Everything okay, Fusco?

366
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,670
没事
Yeah.

367
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,350
就是  有点吃坏肚子了
It's, uh... something I ate probably.

368
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,210
HR的头儿绝不是什么简单的人物
Yeah, well, you don't become head of HR by being sloppy.

369
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,000
如果桑布拉诺想弄死这个记者
So if Zambrano wants your reporter dead,

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,220
他下手肯定会悄无声息
he'll do it in a way that's practically invisible

371
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,240
毫无痕迹
with no strings leading back to him.

372
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,650
弗斯科  你最后一次
Fusco, when's the last time

373
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,580
见西蒙斯是什么时候
you saw your pal Simmons?

374
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,760
上次我为救你朝他开枪之后  就再没见他了
We haven't talked since I shot at him, covering your ass.

375
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,240
找到他  跟踪他
Find him. Tail him.

376
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,450
如果他找你麻烦
And if he gives you any trouble,

377
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,560
我会帮你
I've got your back.

378
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,400
我会跟唐纳利谈谈
I'll talk to Donnelly,

379
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,120
看看HR的贿赂名单中
see who else is on HR's payroll

380
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,770
还有谁没被抓
that hasn't been arrested yet.

381
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,140
如果那位记者在我们找到杀手前
And if your reporter friend gets into trouble

382
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,940
就遇到了麻烦
before we find the shooter--

383
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,910
估计我就只能报警了
Guess I'll have to call the police.

Mr. Walker, your response.

要知道  鲍伯
You see, Bob,

393
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,740
隐匿证据并不能改变犯罪的事实
hiding the evidence doesn't erase the crime.

394
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,620
我的竞选对手显然不懂这点
This is what my opponent doesn't get.

395
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,700
瞧她挑起的
Look at what she started.

396

一名熟悉案件的联调局探员

以及桑布拉诺本人
and Zambrano himself.

405
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,680
他向你承认了吗
He admitted it to you?

406
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,320
他总不会是因为清白无辜才冲我大吼大叫吧
I don't think he was yelling at me 'cause he's innocent.

407
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,280
听说唐纳利已经写好起诉书了
I hear Donnelly's already filed the indictment.

他不进监狱  她就不可能脱离危险

芬奇  这样子我没法保护她
Finch, I can't protect her like this.

去认识好男人

420
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,900

芬奇  我刚刚跟她说了什么
Finch? What did I just say to her?

431
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,970

New cufflinks I could understand,

432
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,000
居然还买了辆十万美元的跑车
but buying a $100,000 sports car--

433
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,340
真的有必要吗

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,290
好吧  该派增援了

佐伊
Zoe.

464
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,920
你想让我吃醋吗
You trying to make me jealous?

465
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,520
芬奇让你待命
Finch have you on standby?

466
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,310
社会心理学

467
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,890
女性更青睐于

468

受到魅力女性认可的男性

469
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,840
玛克辛  这是佐伊
Maxine, this is Zoe.

470
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,820
她是我的朋友
She's a friend.

471
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,150
你们是怎么认识的
So how do you two know each other?

472
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,490
去年我们共同度过了两晚的漫漫长夜
Oh, we spent two very long nights together last year.

473
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,850
真高兴再见到你  约翰
It was great seeing you again, John.

474
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,830
谢谢
Thanks.

475
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,250
你跟佐伊・摩根约会过
You dated Zoe Morgan?

476
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,650
整个城市的记者
There's not a reporter in town

477
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,660
都拼死想要采访那女人
who wouldn't kill to interview that woman.

478
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,740
科学啊
Science.

479
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,780
社会心理学的原则就在于其
The tenets of social psychology are firmly rooted in an unders--

480
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,910
说说你的工作吧
So tell me about your job.

481
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,710
现在手头最刺激的新闻是什么
What's the most exciting story you're working on right now?

482
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,790
你会觉得我很怪
Oh, you'll just think I'm weird.

483
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,550
好吧  传说有一个人
Okay, well, there's a rumor about this guy,

484
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,770
警方一直称他为"西装男"
the police just call him the man in a suit.

485
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,600
无人见过他的容貌  无人知道他的名字
No one's seen his face, no one knows his name.

486
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,290
我甚至不确定他是否存在
I'm not even sure he exists.

487
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,640
可他就像漫画中的角色一样
But he's like something out of a comic book.

488
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,250
人们遇到麻烦时  他就会从天而降
When people are in trouble, he comes out of nowhere.

489
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,740
他似乎总会及时出现
He always seems to be there just in time.

490
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,280
不管他是谁  他救了很多人的性命
And whoever he is, he saves a lot of lives.

491
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,710
也射穿了很多人的膝盖
And he shoots a lot of kneecaps.

492
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,550
听上去是个很棒的家伙
Sounds like a great guy,

493
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,540
一个都市传奇
and an urban legend.

494
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,580
是啊  也许  但如果他真的存在
Yeah, well, maybe. But if he's real...

495
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,430
我就要把他刊登在
I'm going to put that man on the cover

496
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,050
全国每份报纸和杂志的封面上
of every magazine and newspaper in this country.

497
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,450
克里斯多夫・桑布拉诺呢
What about Christopher Zambrano?

498
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,170
我看了你的网站
I read your website.

499
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,030
有没有担心过报道那种人会
Ever worry that writing about a man like that might

500
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,660
让你身处险境
put you in harm's way?

501
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,280
职业风险嘛
Occupational hazard.

502
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,700
其实不如趁机周末出城放松一下
Still couldn't hurt to skip town for the weekend,

503
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,170
等事情平息
let this blow over.

504
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,190
感谢你的关心  约翰
Oh, thanks for your concern, John,

505
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,390
也感谢你约我出城的狡猾手段
and for that very slick offer to whisk me away.

506
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,430
不过  这是我的工作
But, you know, this is what I do.

507
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,520
我挖掘人们想知道的东西
I find out what people need to know,

508
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,730
当权者想隐瞒的东西
what those in power don't want them to know,

509
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,310
确保所有人都能知情
and I make sure everyone hears about it.

510
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,900
对我来说  这值得冒点险
To me, that's worth a little risk.

511
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,850
"在普天下皆骗的时代
"In times of universal deceit,

512
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,850
讲真话就是一种革命行为"
telling the truth is a revolutionary act."

乔治・奥威尔
George Orwell.

514
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,970
不好意思
You know what, I'm sorry.

515
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,490
我得接个电话  抱歉
I have to take this. Sorry.

516
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,710
格伦  好的  格伦  格伦  格伦
Glen. Okay, Glen, Glen, Glen.

517
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,760
慢点说  慢点说
Slow down, slow down!

518
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,150
-现在不太方便  卡特  -有麻烦了
- Kind of busy, Carter. - We have a problem.

519
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,480
我刚和唐纳利打完电话
I just got off the phone with Donnelly, and...

520
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,530
玛克辛关于桑布拉诺是HR幕后老大的报道
Maxine's story about Zambrano being the big boss of HR--

521
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,600
桑布拉诺  HR老大嫌疑人即将被捕

522
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,100
不是真的
It's not true.

523
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,890
天哪  好吧
Oh, my God. Oka--

524
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,210
天呐
Oh, my God.

525
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,460
桑布拉诺不是老大
Zambrano's not the boss?

526
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,970
他甚至不是嫌疑人
He isn't even a suspect.

527
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,970
但她写了那份报道
But then she wrote that thing,

528
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,510
害他成为众矢之的
she put a bull's-eye on his chest.

529
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,000
HR坑过的每一个坏蛋
Every crook HR screwed,

530
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,550
合作过的每一个黑帮
every cartel they worked with,

531
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,200
每个人都想要他的命
everyone wants him dead.

532
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,800
玛克辛没有危险  桑布拉诺才有
Maxine's not in danger, Zambrano is.

533
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,530
我们得赶紧找到他  否则就晚了
We need to find him before it's too late.

534
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,430
你错了  玛克  联调局已经在路上了
You're wrong, Max. The FBI's on their way.

535
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,780
-他们要和你谈谈  -好的
- They wanna talk to you. - Okay, all right.

536
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,140
先别管我  桑布拉诺在哪
Forget about me. Where is Zambrano?

537
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,340
-他还好吗  -他的手机无人接听
- And is he okay? - He's not answering his cell.

538
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,540
没人知道他在哪
No one knows where he is.

539
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,030
紧急情况  再联系
Work emergency. I'll call you.

540
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,650
好吧  我不知道你的紧急情况如何
Okay, well, I don't know what your work emergency is,

541
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,740
但我肯定我的更紧急
but I bet mine's worse.

542
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,540
我害桑布拉诺身处险境
I just put Zambrano's life in danger,

543
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,970
需要你送我一程
so I need you to give me a ride.

544
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,190
好了  在车里等着
Okay, wait in the car.

545
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,160
你很接近了  里瑟先生
You're close, Mr. Reese.

546
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,480
桑布拉诺在你西北方300米的地方
Zambrano is 300 meters west-northwest of you.

547
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,040
估计联调局没监控他的手机
Guess the FBI doesn't have him bluejacked.

548
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,400
桑布拉诺先生
Mr. Zambrano!

549
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,610
桑布拉诺先生
Mr. Zambrano!

550
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,210
克里斯
Chris!

551
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,370
桑布拉诺在哪
Where's Zambrano?

552
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,100
救命
Help!

553
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,310
芬奇
Finch.

554
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,830
我们来晚了
We didn't get here in time.

555
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,190
安吉拉斯女士  安德森先生  是吗
Okay, Ms. Angelis. And Mr. Anderson, was it?

556
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,780
你可以叫我约翰
You can call me John.

557
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,570
我只需要录个口供
I just need to get a statement.

558
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,480
你发现的桑布拉诺先生  对吗
You found Mr. Zambrano, right?

559
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,620
他中枪了
He was shot,

560
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,060
没有呼吸了
and he wasn't breathing.

561
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,620
都是我的错
It was all my fault.

562
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,730
对不起  我能不能  我需要喘口气
I'm sorry, can I-- I just need a minute.

563
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,180
好的  没问题
Yeah, sure.

564
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,790
你和她约会
You're dating her?

565
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,580
你就是如此"保持距离"的吗
That's how you're keeping your distance?

566
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,960
这个  有点复杂
It's, um... complicated.

567
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,080
凶手在现场被我打晕了
Your killers are knocked out at the scene.

568
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,070
我猜他们是斗牛士帮的
My guess is they're Toreros Cartel.

569
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,030
那些想要HR老大命的众多帮派之一
Just one of many organizations that wanted HR's boss dead.

570
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,520
可惜杀错了人
Just got the wrong guy.

571
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,290
我留在这里太不合适了
Look, this isn't the best place for me to be,

572
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,770
但我不能丢下她
but I'm not leaving her.

573
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,070
我能把她带走吗
Can I get her out of here?

574
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,880
好吧
Yeah.

575
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,320
来吧  她说我们能走了
Come on. She said we could go.

576
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,620
另类的第一次约会啊
Some first date, huh?

577
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
玛克辛・安吉拉斯
Maxine Angelis.

578
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,010
我是唐纳利特工  联调局的
Special Agent Donnelly, FBI.

579
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,910
你得回答一些问题
You're gonna answer some questions.

580
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,570
门卫告诉我
The gate guard told me

581
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,450
你曾和桑布拉诺有过争吵
that you'd been arguing with Zambrano,

582
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,590
而且我和一名特工谈过
and an agent I spoke to--

583
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,550
克拉克特工一无所知
Agent Clark didn't know anything,

584
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,990
不过我完全没兴趣
but I am really not interested

585
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,000
听你为自己的行为进行辩解
in hearing you try to justify what you did.

586
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,930
我只想知道是谁第一个告诉你
All I want is the name of the person who first told you

587
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,840
克里斯・桑布拉诺是HR的头儿
that Chris Zambrano was the head of HR.

588
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,230
我接到一个电话  是匿名消息
I got a call. It was an anonymous tip.

589
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,860
是个男的  号码屏蔽了
It was a man. Blocked number.

590
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,690
11:41  是这个
11:41. That's it.

591
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,060
但如果他不是老大  那你为什么
But if he wasn't the boss, then why were you even--

592
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,470
你究竟知不知道
Do you have any idea how

593
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,860
你捅了多大的篓子
colossally you just screwed up?

594
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,300
桑布拉诺不是HR的老大
Zambrano wasn't HR's boss.

595
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,970
他是能够扳倒老大的证人
He was the witness that could bring the boss down.

596
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,090
桑布拉诺的父亲是HR在黑帮的核心人物
Zambrano's father was the mob's point man with HR.

597
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,930
他做了记录  有一个账本
And he kept records-- a ledger--

598
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,710
记录了HR的贿赂名单及贿赂金额
with names and dollar amounts for everyone on HR's payroll,

599
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,090
包括老大
including the boss.

600
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,310
黑帮头目死后
And when the Don died,

601
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,120
克里斯・桑布拉诺发现了账本
Chris Zambrano found that ledger.

602
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,770
但与他爸爸不同  克里斯是好人
But unlike his dad, Chris was a good man.

603
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,600
清清白白
Totally clean.

604
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,070
当他意识到自己拿的是什么
When he realized what he was holding,

605
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,260
他联系了联调局
he called the FBI.

606
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,060
为什么你不保护他
Why didn't you protect him?

607
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,050
你以为我们在争吵什么
What do you think we were arguing about?

608
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,090
我试着说服他
I tried to convince him.

609
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,620
但就因为你这种人
But because of people like you

610
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,220
总是视他为罪犯
calling him a criminal all his life,

611
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,720
桑布拉诺害怕我们也会认为他不干净
Zambrano was afraid that we would think he was dirty too.

612
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,850
他要求拿到豁免后  才交出账本
He'd only turn over the ledger once he'd sign an immunity deal,

613
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,800
相关文件今晚才送到
and the paperwork came through tonight.

614
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,920
如果你敢报道一个字
And if you print one word of this,

615
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,910
我就以妨碍公务罪把你关起来
I will lock your ass up for obstruction.

616
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,680
你的消息来自一次性手机
Well, your tip came from a disposable cell,

617
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,840
罪犯的首选
the first choice of criminals

618
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,460
几乎不可能被追查到
and virtually impossible to trace.

619
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,110
所以恭喜你  安吉拉斯女士
So congratulations, Ms. Angelis,

620
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,940
你被耍了
you just got played,

621
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,540
多半是被真正的HR头儿耍了
probably by the real head of HR.

622
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,650
这么说玛克辛不是受害人  而是行凶者
So Maxine wasn't the victim. She was the perpetrator.

623
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,320
无意间的  非自愿的
Unwitting, involuntary,

624
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,370
但仍然是行凶者
but a perpetrator all the same.

625
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,620
一石二鸟
With one stroke,

626
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,940
老大解决了唯一能扳倒他的证人
the boss wipes out the only witness who could bring him down.

627
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,250
还毁了一名麻烦记者的职业生涯
And destroys the career of a troublesome reporter to boot.

628
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,060
我们要找出那个王八蛋
And we're gonna find out who that bastard is

629
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,230
扳倒他
and bring him down.

630
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,650
我来查一下桑布拉诺的网络数据资料
And I'll search Zambrano's digital footprint,

631
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,250
看看能不能找到他把那本写有老大名字的账本
see if I can find out where he hid the ledger

632
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,910
藏在哪里了
with the boss' name in it.

633
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,750
那我看看我们的卧底能挖出点什么
And I'll see what our undercover can dig up.

634
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,530
弗斯科  你得和西蒙斯谈谈
Fusco, you and Simmons need to have a little talk.

635
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,060
探探他是否知道HR真正的头儿是谁
See if he knows who the real head of HR is.

636
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,960
不  如果西蒙斯知道
Nah, if Simmons knew that,

637
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,090
我们搞掉HR的时候我就抓到老大了
I would have brought down the boss when we took down HR.

638
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,980
还是问问吧  有发现及时告诉我
Well, ask anyway, and let me know if you find anything out.

639
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,070
好吧  老大
Will do, boss.

640
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,720
好吧  桑布拉诺  你到底把账本藏哪了
All right, Zambrano, where did you hide that ledger?

641
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,610
玛克辛・安吉拉斯
Maxine Angelis.

642
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,760
玛克吗  我是奎恩  你怎么样了
Max? Quinn. How are you?

643
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,700
看来是轮到我水深火热了
Guess I was due for a tough day.

644
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,990
是啊  我们接下来会利用此事贬低你的可信度
Yeah, look, we're gonna have use this thing to discredit you,

645
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
以及你写的格里芬报道的可信度
everything you wrote about Griffin.

646
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,460
要把你往火坑里推了  玛克
We're throwing you under the bus, Max.

647
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,640
抱歉
Sorry.

648
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,470
你是真正的朋友  奎恩
You're a true friend, Quinn.

649
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,060
格伦
Glen.

650
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,420
我能做点什么吗
What can I do?

651
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,910
我们已经解决了
I think we've got it handled.

652
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,770
我们准备把A1版上的选举文章
We're moving the election off A-1

653
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,830
替换成为桑布拉诺澄清的文章
to make room for our retraction on Zambrano.

654
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,690
我可以写澄清的文章
I can write the retraction.

655
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,210
恐怕你不能再写任何东西了
I'm afraid you won't be writing anything

656
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,980
要等我们跟律师谈过后再说
until we sit down with legal.

657
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,900
安吉拉斯女士的记者生涯虽然前途未卜
Ms. Angelis' future as a journalist may be in doubt,

658
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
但她还是没停止调查
but she's not done investigating.

659
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,280
她正打给那个一次性手机
She's calling that disposable cell.

660
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,490
您已转接入
You have reached a voice mail box

661
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,240
尚未设置的语音信箱
that has not been set up yet.

662
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,080
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are,

663
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,130
但我知道你做了什么  也知道如何查到你
but I know what you did, and I know where to find your name.

664
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,490
一旦让我查到
And when I do,

665
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,060
我会把你带着手铐的照片
I will put a picture of you in handcuffs

666
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,040
登在报纸的头版头条上
on the front page of this paper.

667
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,910
她要去找HR的账本
She's looking for that HR ledger.

668
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,520
我得阻止她
Then I need to get her to stop

669
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,250
惹上麻烦
before she gets herself in trouble.

670
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,310
-你好  -玛克辛  我是约翰
- Hello? - Maxine, it's John.

671
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,510
不知可否约你出来喝一杯
I thought maybe you could use a drink.

672
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,000
接到你的电话我很惊喜
I was surprised to hear from you.

673
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,060
第一次约会就遇着谋杀
There's generally no second date

674
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,840
一般不会再有第二次了
when the first one ends in homicide.

675
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,720
我  一直想你
Well, I was, um... thinking about you,

676
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,250
想看看我能否能帮上忙
and I wanted to see if I could help.

677
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,860
既然你主动提出来
Well, now that you mention it,

678
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,980
我想借你专业的会计眼光
I could use your accounting skills

679
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,510
帮我看一下这些记录
to just go through these records.

680
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,500
这是我能找到的桑布拉诺的所有资料
Here's everything I've got on Zambrano.

681
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,840
我们在找桑布拉诺可能藏
We're looking for anywhere Zambrano might've--

682
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,960
我觉得我们应该把这些事情
I think maybe we should just leave that

683
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,450
交给有关部门处理
for the proper authorities.

684
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,150
我把独家新闻看得重于事实真相
I put getting the scoop before getting the truth.

685
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,180
我的自负害死了一个好人
And my arrogance cost a good man his life.

686
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,490
现在我  我做什么都无法弥补了
Now I can't--I can't do anything to fix that.

687
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,770
但我一定会抓住那个幕后的王八蛋
But I sure as hell can catch the bastard behind all of this.

688
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,050
谢谢你的啤酒
Thanks for the beer.

689
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,450
玛克辛  玛克辛
Maxine. Maxine!

690
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,680
我了解那种无法挽回的感受
I know how it feels to do things you can never take back.

691
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,790
我无法平复你的伤痛  阻止你去弥补
I can't stop you from hurting or wanting to fix this.

692
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,710
但我不想让你以为自己是一个人
But I just don't want you to think you're alone.

693
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,870
趴下
Get down!

694
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,270
芬奇  我想那老大收到玛克辛的信息了
Finch, I think the boss got Maxine's message.

695
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,740
钥匙给我
Give me your keys.

696
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,100
芬奇  我们现在去我家
Finch, we're heading to my place.

697
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,920
糟了  你的狗在我这里
Oh, shoot! I've got your dog.

698
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,530
小熊比照片上还可爱
Bear's even cuter than his picture.

699
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,100
他很喜欢那个柜子嘛
He really likes that closet, huh?

700
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,930
他的  宝贝在里面
His, uh, treats are in there.

701
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,720
刚才真是精彩
So...that was interesting.

702
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,780
也许我们应该报警
Maybe we should call the cops.

703
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,270
报哪个警
Which ones?

704
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
HR的老大还逍遥在外
If HR's boss is still out there,

705
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,300
我不知道能相信谁
I don't know who to trust.

706
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,970
你知道是谁向我们开枪吗
Any idea who was shooting at us?

707
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,680
不知道  但既然他们想杀我
No, but if they're trying to kill me,

708
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,270
我肯定是做对了什么事
I must be doing something right.

709
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,930
看来你的无聊工作收入不菲啊
Guess your boring job pays all right.

710
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,680
我明天请病假
I'm calling in sick tomorrow.

711
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,330
这件事结束前我不会把你丢下的
I won't leave your side until this is over.

712
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,340
你是好男人  约翰・安德森
You're a good man, John Anderson.

713
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,770
我今晚睡沙发
I'll sleep on the couch.

714
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,230
如我所言  好男人啊
Like I said, a good man.

715
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,220
我想摘一下隐形眼镜
And if I wanna take my contacts out?

716
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,880
那边
That way.

717
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,420
你几时会需要那么些东西
When were you ever going to need all those?

718
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,360
你不该把她带到这里来  里瑟先生
You shouldn't have brought her back here, Mr. Reese.

719
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,700
再好的伪装也禁不起推敲
Even the best cover just goes so deep.

720
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,410
她待得越久  疑问就会越多
The longer she stays, the more questions she'll have.

721
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,620
想想她走出来看到你
Imagine how many questions she'll have

722
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,860
会产生多少疑问吧
if she comes out and sees you here.

723
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,800
你看清开枪打你们的人的模样了吗
Did you get a good look at the men that were shooting at you?

724
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,200
我尽力了  但他们在开枪打我呀
I tried, but they were shooting at me.

725
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,710
我会黑进酒吧的监控录像
I'll get into the pub's security system

726
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,760
看看能查到什么
and see what I can find.

727
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,480
我找到一条线索  里瑟先生
I've got a lead, Mr. Reese.

728
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,150
我从酒吧的监控录像里找到了枪手的照片
I got images of the shooters from the pub's security.

729
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,780
然后找到了一个照片共享网站
Then I found a photo sharing site

730
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,660
里边有面部识别软件
that had a facial recognition app

731
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,250
这软件去年因为一起诉讼关闭
that was shut down by a lawsuit last year.

732
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,890
我黑了进去  从后台打开了软件
I hacked in, turned the app back on,

733
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,540
并确认了枪手身份
and identified our gunmen.

734
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,090
他们是联调局的
They're FBI.

735
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,550
前联调局的
Ex-FBI.

736
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,690
博格尔特工和皮特特工
Agents Bogle and Pitt.

737
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,500
他们去年提前退休了
They took early retirement last year.

738
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,030
但如果他们在局里还有关系
But if they've still got contacts at the bureau,

739
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,550
我猜就是他们告诉HR老大
I'd guess that they're the ones that told HR's boss

740
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,830
桑布拉诺账本的事
about Zambrano's ledger.

741
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,020
芬奇  我知道你想要我保持伪装
Finch, I know you want me to keep my cover,

742
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,350
但玛克辛需要知道她在跟什么人打交道
but Maxine needs to know what she's dealing with,

743
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,480
而我需要有能力保护她
and I need to be able to protect her.

744
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,870
冷静  约翰
Calm down, John.

745
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,340
我给你的女朋友发了同样内容的短信
I sent your girlfriend a text with the same information,

746
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,820
当然是匿名的
anonymously of course.

747
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,680
我需要和你一位朋友谈谈
I need to talk to a friend of yours.

748
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,850
伦纳德・皮特和克莱格・博格尔
Leonard Pitt and Craig Bogle,

749
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,800
因被控骚扰和诬告而被开除
forced out for harassment and malicious prosecution.

750
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,840
传言说他们被人掌控了
Word is that they were in someone's pocket.

751
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,130
利用职务之便为自己真正的老大卖命
They were using those badges to do favors for their real boss.

752
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,870
那个用一次性手机
The man who got Zambrano killed

753
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,830
打一个电话就害死了桑布拉诺的人
with one call from a disposable cell,

754
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,970
HR的头儿  他到底是谁
the head of HR-- who is he?

755
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,430
有些秘密即使是我也不知道
There's some secrets that even I don't know.

756
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,210
但你知道谁会买一次性手机
But you know who buys disposables by the case--

757
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,830
罪犯  当然了
Criminals, sure.

758
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,510
政治竞选也会
But also political campaigns.

759
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,680
便宜  无法追查  匿名
They're cheap, untraceable, anonymous.

760
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,840
一旦他们的肮脏行为被抓住
And if they get caught playing dirty tricks,

761
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,610
这些可以救命
it can save their ass.

762
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,070
我们希望我们的城市
Is this the kind of experience

763
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,800
虚伪
欺诈
可悲

764
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,830
由这种人掌管吗
we want running our city?

765
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,320
兰登・沃克才是负责任的
Landon Walker is the responsible,

766
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,220
{\pos(176,102)}兰登・沃克

767
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,220
明智之选

768
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,680
可靠的市长人选
reliable choice for mayor.

769
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,950
桑布拉诺因为知道HR老大的名字被杀
Zambrano gets killed for knowing the name of HR's boss

770
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,900
正好在选举前五天
five days before an election.

771
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,430
你的意思是那个老大在竞选市长
Are you telling me the boss is running for mayor?

772
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,100
我只是提出个观点
I'm rendering an opinion.

773
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,690
个人而言  我会避开政客
Personally, I avoid politicians.

774
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,990
他们基本上没什么实权
They so rarely have any real power.

775
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,800
很高兴见到你
You know, it's a pleasure meeting you.

776
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,540
但很遗憾  我们从未见过面
But it's a shame we never met.

777
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,320
乖  约翰
Be good, John.

778
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,760
是的  好  非常好  非常感谢
Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.

779
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,240
格里芬的一个老对手刚才证实了
One of Griffin's old opponents just confirmed

780
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,060
在竞选期间曾被博格尔和皮特骚扰过
being harassed by Bogle and Pitt during their campaign.

781
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,490
既然格里芬的支持率在上升
If Griffin's higher than before,

782
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,140
他们可能还在为他卖命
they're probably still working for him.

783
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,840
这些足够你在头版揭露他吗
Do you have enough to unmask him on the front page?

784
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,580
我绝不会再犯同样的错误了
I will never make that mistake again.

785
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,880
除非拿到账本  否则我不会再刊登
I am not going to press until I have that ledger in my hands.

786
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,360
我们只需要找出桑布拉诺把它藏在哪里
We just need to find where Zambrano hid it.

787
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,910
顺便说一句  顺利骗到我第三次约会了
Pretty smooth conning me into a third date, by the way.

788
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,100
我更愿意视之为首次约会的第三次尝试
I like to think of it as a third attempt at a first date.

789
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,210
等等
Wait. Wait.

790
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,200
桑布拉诺说所有人都觉得他是黑手党
Zambrano said that everybody thought he was a wise guy,

791
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,380
没人会看他做的善事
and nobody ever looked at the good things he did.

792
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,660
如果他要找个地方藏账本
If he were looking for a place to hide that ledger,

793
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,670
也许会藏到一个他认为
maybe he would put it where he thought

794
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,920
没人会看的地方
no one would go looking.

795
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,540
你那辆靓车上有撬棍吗
Does that fancy car of yours have a crowbar?

796
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,860
这里  门没锁
Here. It's unlocked.

797
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,110
先从马找起
Start with the horses.

798
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,020
它们昨天刚被运来
They were still being delivered yesterday.

799
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,140
找到了
Found something.

800
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,730
桑布拉诺的账本
Zambrano's ledger.

801
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,470
想知道是谁在管理HR吗
Wanna find out who's running HR?

802
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,540
多谢了  玛克辛
Thanks, Maxine.

803
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,930
我们老大找得好苦
My boss has been looking all over for that.

804
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,000
我已经通知了卡特警探
I've called Detective Carter,

805
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,860
救援就快到了  里瑟先生
and help is on the way, Mr. Reese.

806
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,330
我知道这有违你的本性
I know it goes against your nature,

807
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,540
但一采取行动
but you can't take action

808
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,490
玛克辛就会知道你的真实身份
without Maxine learning who you really are.

809
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,300
在尽可能的情况下  等待救援
If at all possible, wait for rescue.

810
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,950
我会尽量记着
I'll try to keep that in mind.

811
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,020
我得说  玛克辛  你可帮了个大忙
I gotta tell you, Maxine, you've been a huge help.

812
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,940
先是桑布拉诺  然后是账本
First Zambrano, then the ledger,

813
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,890
现在你又好心地带上了你的男朋友
and now you're kind enough to bring your boyfriend.

814
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,150
我只要把你们俩扔回你家
I'm just gonna dump the two of you at your place.

815
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,850
布置成
We'll make it look like

816
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,480
恋人吵架升级为杀人后自杀
a lover's spat turned murder-suicide.

817
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,930
我死了
When I wind up dead,

818
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,260
你以为警察不会发现我的笔记上有你的名字吗
you think the police won't find your names in my notes,

819
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,290
博格尔特工
Agent Bogle?

820
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,150
还是应该叫博格尔先生
Or is it Mr. Bogle now?

821
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,000
现在你不惜双重谋杀来封我的口
And now you're doing a double homicide to shut me up.

822
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,870
等你被捕后  你的老大
But when you get caught, will your boss even think twice

823
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,130
杀你灭口之前会有一点点犹豫吗
before killing you to cover his tracks?

824
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,530
顺便问一句  你老大是谁啊
Who is your boss, by the way?

825
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,560
我们要不要打开账本看一下
Should we open that ledger and find out?

826
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,910
这应该表示"无可奉告"
Guess that's a "No comment."

827
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,180
纽约警察  放下武器
NYPD! Drop your weapon!

828
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,440
联调局  我们在执行公务
FBI! We're here on official business.

829
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,360
安吉拉斯女士是一宗谋杀案的目击证人
Ms. Angelis is a witness in a homicide investigation.

830
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,460
放下枪
Drop your guns!

831
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,320
你听见警笛声了吗  皮特
You hear sirens, Pitt?

832
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,310
两个纽约警局的警探
Two NYPD detectives just took a hot door

833
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,770
没有支援就冲了过来
without calling for backup.

834
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,570
你们也不是执行公务来的
You're not here on official business either.

835
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,220
格里芬在哪里  格里芬在哪里  格里芬在哪里
Where's Griffin? Where's Griffin? Where's Griffin?

836
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,040
沃克
Walker.

837
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,080
{\pos(182,103)}沃克是HR的老大

838
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,940

839

详情尽在明天的报纸上
Nothing you can't read in tomorrow's paper.

842
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,090
抱歉  女士
Excuse me, ma'am.

843
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,340
我们需要那个作为证据
We're gonna need that as evidence.

844
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,050
谢谢你
Thank you.

845

能做到吗
Can we do that?

850
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,650
兰登・沃克
Landon Walker!

851
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,700
你因受贿罪
You're under arrest for receiving bribes,

852
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,480
企业腐败罪和同谋罪被捕

853
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,040
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

854
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,990

Anything you say can and will be used

855
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,330
成为呈堂证供
against you in a court of law.

856
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,290

你脱身了  老大被关起来了

一旦进来  永远别想退出

你还想要我做什么
You want anything else from me...

862
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,650
不许再提我的孩子
never mention my kid again.

863
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,250
我不是你儿子的威胁  莱奈尔
I'm not a threat to your son, Lionel.

864
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,880
你才是

你平常的约会是这样的啊
So this is what a normal date with you is like.

867
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,870

Nice, isn't it?

868
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,340
不过这恐怕是最后一次了
And I'm afraid it has to be our last.

869

我喜欢你  约翰
I like you, John.

870
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,990
还挺喜欢的
Quite a bit actually.

871
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,460
但是我已经嫁给工作了
But I'm married to my work.

872
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,320
老实说  我觉得你心里还有点记挂

873
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,700
佐伊・摩根

874
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,710
回见
See ya.

875
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,740
那你放弃追踪西装男了吗
So you're off to chase your man in the suit?

876
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,870
不  你是对的  都市传奇
No, you were right. Urban legend.

877
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,200
就我这一周的经历来说
And with the week I just had,

878
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,960
如果真有这么一个人
if there really was a man like that,

879
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,070
我应该已经见到他了
I think I'd have met him by now.

880
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,870
里瑟先生  似乎还没结束
Mr. Reese, this may not be over.

881
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,540
你太偏执  芬奇
You're paranoid, Finch.

882
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,460
即使如此
Be that as it may...

883
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,620
仍觉得我们没抓对人
don't think we got the right guy.

884
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,760
沃克在HR的贿赂名单上
Walker was on HR's payroll.

885
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,990
他有害死桑布拉诺的动机
He'd have motive to want Zambrano dead.

886
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,410
是的  是的  绝对是他雇佣了
Yes, yes, and he definitely hired

887
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,750
皮特和博格尔去杀玛克辛
Pitt and Bogle to hunt down Maxine,

888
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,050
就是这点让我很疑惑
but that's what troubles me.

889
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,180
HR的头儿非常聪明  不像会雇佣
The head of HR is brilliant, not the type to hire

890
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,990
两个失败的联邦探员去谋杀一位记者
a pair of washed up feds to gun down a reporter.

891
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,630
沃克  我不觉得他有足够的头脑
And Walker-- I'm not convinced he has the cunning

892
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,860
和人脉策划如此复杂的事件
or the connections to mastermind something this complicated.

893
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,850
好吧
All right.

894
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,690
如果沃克不是HR真正的头儿
If Walker isn't the real head of HR,

895
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,800
那谁是
who is?
