你再查下去
You keep digging,

168
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,260
我们就得对你动手了
we're gonna put you in the ground,

169
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,710
就像你男朋友一样
just like we did to your boyfriend.

170
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,280
你把你那惊魂未定的肮脏搭档拉进来
You drag your recovering dirtbag partner into this,

171
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,770
我们就连他一起收拾

172
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,150
或许还有  你的孩子
And maybe... your kid.

173
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,520
现在  能不能帮你自己个忙
Now...are you gonna do yourself a favor

174
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,400
老实坐着  乖乖接受

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,410
这样才是好孩子
That's a good girl.

177
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,730
{\pos(156,260)}完成

178
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,380
老大  不  她不会再惹麻烦了

179
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,950
下一步  我们会杀死以利亚的左右手

180
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,320
然后就轮到他本人了

181
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,870
我打了电话给几个朋友
I called in a couple of favors.

Staying with a guy named Leon.

185
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,400
没想到你会喜欢那狗
Didn't think you even liked the dog.

186
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,510
岂止喜欢  他是我留下的唯一理由
Like him? He's the only reason I'm sticking around.

187
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,560
为什么来这里
Why are we here?

188
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,140
因为机器说在这里
Because the machine said this is

189
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,630
我能找到答案
where I'll find the answer.

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,160
什么问题的答案
What was the question?

191
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,690
机器的位置何在
Where the machine is located.

192
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,170
它不能直接告诉你吗
Can't it just tell you?

193
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,400
我想芬奇编程禁止了  以保护它
I think Finch programmed it not to, to protect it.

194
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,430
无意冒犯
No offense.

195
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,140
不过或许芬奇想自己控制机器
Maybe Finch wants control of the machine himself.

196
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,580
就算芬奇跟病毒有关
If Finch had something to do with the virus,

197
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,240
也肯定有他的理由
I'm sure he had his reasons.

198
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,220
反过来说  这样机器
On the upside, hopefully the machine

199
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,470
也不会告诉根它在哪里
won't have told Root where it is either.

200
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,070
下次让我见到这女人
Next time I see that woman,

201
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,910
我就直接开枪
I'm shooting her.

202
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,630

她们是谁

不

222
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,320
这不是芬奇的笔迹

223
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,000
肯定是英格拉姆也在找机器

我们走

我们承包建造一栋建筑

它要能隐身于众目睽睽之下

剩下的他们搞定

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,800
于是你偷看了数据

只是输入输出端  其余都被加密了

它正在跟你通话  是吗

走  快  多重  威胁

他的副手今早中枪了

你叫那玩意儿带我们逃出去

你老爸想要干掉你

431
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,680
有  一报还一报
Yeah. What goes around comes around.

432
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,630
不  你没资格跟我说话
No. You don't get to talk to me.

433
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,230
我忠于自我

434
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,650
就像这位朋友约格洛夫先生

So I made sure that when they did

521
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,920

526
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,530
就是教它保护自己
would be to teach it to protect itself.

我本无意让你卷入此事  里瑟先生
I didn't want to involve you in this business, Mr. Reese,

528
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,450
因为我原本希望  如果我回不去

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,450
你能继续我们未竟的事业

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,230
在这种局势下  说这话可过分了
That's a strong word to be throwing around given where we're standing.

告诉我  你把机器搬去哪儿了
So tell me, where did you move the machine?

546
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,220
它自己搬走了
It moved itself.

547
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,230
那是谁在控制它
But who controls it?

548
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,460
目前  它在自我控制
As of now, it controls itself.

549
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,900
那些号码  它会继续给我们吗
The numbers, will they continue to come to us?

550
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,500
那要由机器决定
That will be up to the machine.

551
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,520
如果不能继续
If they don't start up again,

552
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,000
我们国家就将毫无防御
the country is defenseless.

553
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,800
不  只是防御稍弱罢了
No, just less well-defended.

554
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,990
我想我们彼此都明白现在的危机
I think we both understand that what's at stake here

555
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,240
已经超出了国家防御范围

556
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,860
是吗
Has it?

557
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,930
你为我们制造机器来保护人民

You can dictate your terms.

You have my word.

563
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,900
你向我的朋友保证过
You gave my friend your word.

564
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,550

Mr. Reese, I owe you an explanation,

618
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,980
以及道歉
and an apology.

619
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,930
三年前
Three years ago,

620
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,730
我为了放机器自由而泄露代码时
when I put the code out there to free the machine,

621
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,310
完全不知道其途径
I had no idea what path it would take

622
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,870
也不知道可能因此产生的后果
or what unintended consequences it might have.

623
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,400
我从未想伤害任何人
I never intended to hurt anyone,

624
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,490
但我明白有人可能会受伤
but I accepted that someone might get hurt.

625
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,150
我一直在担心我所引发的
I always worried that events that I had set in motion

626
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,600
可能改变了你的人生

七年前我在航站楼保持沉默时
when I kept my mouth shut at an airport terminal seven years ago.

629
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,870
你与此毫无关系
You didn't have anything to do with that.

630
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,720
你失去了朋友
You lost a friend.

631
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,840
你做了你该做的
You did what you had to do.
