2
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,360
从前有位可爱的公主
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

3
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,200
但是她被可怕的魔法控制了
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort...

4
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,160
只有真爱的初吻才可以打破这魔法
which could only be broken by love's first kiss.

5
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,580
她被困在一个城堡里
She was locked away in a castle...

6
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,880
由一只喷火龙看守着
guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.

7
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,340
有许多勇敢的骑士曾经想过把她从这可怕的监狱中救走
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,

8
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,180
但是 没有一个成功
but none prevailed.

9
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,430
她关在被喷火龙看守着的
She waited in the dragon's keep...

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,430
城堡里最高的房间里
in the highest room of the tallest tower...

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,060
等待着真爱的初吻
for her true love and true love's first kiss.

12
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,510
那是不会发生的
Like that's ever gonna happen.

13
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,520
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,560
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

15
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,570
She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

16
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,360
In the shape of an Lon her forehead

17
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,753
The years start comin ' and they don't stop comin'

18
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:55,254
怪物史瑞克

19
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,620
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,920
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
So much to do So much to see

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,590
So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

23
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,710
You'll never know if you don't go

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,260
You'll never shine if you don't glow

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,260
Hey, now You're an all-star

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,720

And all that glitters is gold

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,280
Only shootin' stars break the mould

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

31
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,610
You'rebund led up now but wait till you get older

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,820
But the meteor men beg to differ

33
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,830
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

34
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,620
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

35
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,660
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

36
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,670
My world's on fire How about yours

37
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,420

Only shootin' stars break the mould

43
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,650
- 快 - 快
- Go! - Go!

44
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,860
Go. Go. Go.

45
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,190

Only shootin' stars break the mould

50
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,710
- 我想它在里面吧? - 好的 我们去吧!
- Think it's in there? - All right. Let's get it!

51
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,529
慢着! 你知道有什么后果吗?
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

52
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,490
嗯 它会把你的骨头当面包吃

53
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,530
哈哈 实际上那会是一个巨人
Yes, well, actually, that would be agiant.

54
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,660
不过 青怪可能更糟糕
Now, ogres They're much worse.

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,670
它们会用你们的鲜皮做汤
They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,840
- 不 - 挖出你的心肝

- 这样吃吐司面包会很好味道! - 退后 退后 怪物!
- Actually, it's quite good on toast. - Back! Back, beast!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam!

113
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,580
都跑光了
They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods.

114
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,580
看到这样确实使我感觉很好
That really made me feel good to see that.

116
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,340
现在跟你的朋友去庆祝你的自由 好吗?
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

117
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,720
但是 我没有朋友
But, uh, I don't have any friends.

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,470
我也不会自己一个人出去
And I'm not goin' out there by myself.

119
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,100
嘿 等等 我有一个很好的提议 我跟你一起
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you.

120
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,100
你是一个令人惧怕青怪
You're a mean, green, fightin' machine.

121
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,390
我们一起会吓跑经过我们的人
Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

122
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,440
噢 真吓人
Oh, wow! That was really scary.

123
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,240
这很可怕 如果这不起作用 你的呼吸会起作用的
If you don't mind me sayin if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done,

124
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,450
你需要些口香糖 你喘气太臭了!
'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

125
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,440
你几乎把我的鼻毛都烧着了
You almost burned the hair outta my nose,

126
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,660
就像那次
just like the time

127
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,460
烂草莓 我那天放了很多屁
Then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out ofmy butt that day.

128
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,250
你为什么跟着我?
Why are you following me?

129
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,920
我告诉你为什么
I'll tell you why.

130
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,930
'Cause I'm all alone

131
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,760
There's no one here beside me

132
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,520
My problems have all gone

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,940
There's no one to deride me

134
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,980
But you gotta have friends

135
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,510
别唱了!
Stop singing!

136
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,240
怪不得你没有朋友
It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

137
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,950
噢 只有真正的朋友才会这么诚实
Wow. Only a true friend would be that truly honest.

138
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,120
听着 驴子 看看我 我是谁?
Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

- 真高? - 不! 我是个妖怪
- Really tall? - No! I'm an ogre.

141
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,550
你想一下 拿着你的火把和草杈!
You know. Grab your torch and pitchforks.

142
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,630
这不让你烦恼吗?
Doesn't that bother you?

143
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,840
不
Nope.

144
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,810

我不在乎别人怎么看我
You got that kind of I don't care what nobody thinks of me thing.

149

我喜欢这个 我敬佩这个 史瑞克
I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right.

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
瞧那里! 谁想住在那里?
Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want to live in a place like that?

151
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,500
那是我的家
That would be my home.

152
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,460
很好! 很漂亮!

你不知道怪物的生活是什么样的 也许你知道
You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, may be you do.

这就是为什么我们要在一起 让我留下吧!

175
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,700

You're living in the past It's a new generation

你赢得了从事一个伟大 高尚的任务荣誉
You've won the honour of embarking on a great and noble quest.

任务? 我的任务就是要寻求归还我的沼泽地
Quest? I'm already on a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

380
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,570
- 你的沼泽地? - 对 我的沼泽地!
- Your swamp? - Yeah, my swamp!

381
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,120
你把那些家伙扔在那里!
Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!

382
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,790
的确
Indeed.

383
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,950
是的 妖怪 我们做个交易
All right, ogre, I'll make you a deal.

384
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,830
你为我完成任务 我就把沼泽地还给你
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

385
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,630
恢复原状?
Exactly the way it was?

386
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,460
恢复到粘泥覆盖的原始模样
Down to the last slime-covered toad stool.

387
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,800
- 那些擅自占据者呢? - 全部搬走
- And the squatters? - As good as gone.

388
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,810
什么样的任务?
What kind of quest?

389
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,480
你要去跟龙作战
Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon...

390
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,190
救出公主 然后回到沼泽地去
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp...

391
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,400
你现在没有沼泽地了 因为弗瓜王塞了些怪物进去
which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

392
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,820
- 这不对吗? - 也许驴子不会讲话是有道理的
- Is that about right? - Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

393
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,450
你为什么不把你的魔力都用在他身上?
I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuffon him?

394
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,450
包围他的堡垒
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress,

395
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,370
碾碎他的骨头夹面包吃 妖怪所有的本事
grind his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.

396
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,370
我知道
Oh, I know what.

397
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,670
也许我可以砍掉全村人的头
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village...

398
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,880
把他们挂在长矛上
and put their heads on a pike,

399
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,590
拿把刀 割开他们的脾 喝他们的脾液
gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.

400
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,800
你看怎么样?
Does that sound good to you?

401
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,510
不 真的 不怎么样
Uh, no, not really, no.

402
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,390
告诉你 妖怪比你想像的复杂
For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.

403
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,230
- 举个例子 - 例子?
- Example? - Example?

404
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:08,440
- 好妖怪就像洋葱 - 它们辣臭?
- Okay, um, ogres are like onions. - They stink?

405
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,820
- 不 - 让你流泪? - 不!
- Yes No! - They make you cry? - No!

406
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,320
你把它们放在阳光下 它们都会变黄?
You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

407
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,410
是层!
No! Layers!

408
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,830
洋葱有很多多层
Onions have layers.

409
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,200
妖怪多层! 洋葱多层
Ogres have layers! Onions have layers.

410
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,710
你明白吗? 我们都有好多层
You get it? We both have layers.

411
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,210
你们都有好多层
Oh, you both have layers. Oh.

412
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,670
可并不是人人都喜欢洋葱
You know, not everybody likes onions.

413
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,390
蛋糕! 大家都喜欢蛋糕!
Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

414
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,390
我不管大家喜欢什么
I don't care... what everyone likes.

415
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,180
妖怪不像蛋糕
Ogres are not like cakes.

416
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,400
你知道大家还喜欢什么? 冻糕
You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits.

417
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,400
你试过问别人: 吃冻糕
Have you ever met a person, you say, Let's get some parfait,

418
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,400
他回答: 不 我不喜欢冻糕?
they say, No, I don't like no parfait?

419
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,240
- 冻糕味道好极了 - 没有!
- Parfaits are delicious. - No!

420
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,070
你这个愚蠢讨厌的驴子
You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden!

421
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,080
妖怪像洋葱!行了吧
Ogres are like onions! End of story.

422
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,120
再见 回头见
Bye-bye. See ya later.

423
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,380
冻糕也许是这个星球上最可口的东西
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

424
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,670
我想我宁愿听你哼歌
You know, I think I preferred your humming.

425
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,430
你有餐巾纸吗? 我这里一塌糊涂
Do you have a tissue or something? I'm makinga mess.

426
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,430
冻糕这个词让我流口水了
Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.

427
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,730
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

428
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,320
Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh

429
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,860
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

430
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,410
Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh

431
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,410
And everything that you receive up yonder

432
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,420
Is what you give to me the day I wander

433
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,460
I'm on my way

434
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,470
I'm on my way

435
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,640
I'm on my way

436
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,180
史瑞克! 是你干的吗?
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?

437
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,060
你放屁之前得通知一声
You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open.

438
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,850
相信我 驴子如果是我 你早就薰死了
Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.

439
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,690
是硫磺石
It's brimstone.

440
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,940
- 我们一定快到了 - 对 硫磺石
- We must be getting close. - Yeah, right, brimstone.

441
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,110
别告诉我硫磺石 我知道我闻到了什么 不可能是硫磺石
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone.

442
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,160
也没有什么石头
It didn't come off no stone neither.

443
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,510
确实 够大的了 但看一下位置
Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

444
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,350
史瑞克? 记得你说过妖怪有好多层吗?
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?

445
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,360
没错
Oh, aye.

446
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,030
我有点儿事要坦白
Well, I have a bit ofa confession to make.

447
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,490
驴子没有好多层 我们的恐惧都表现在袖子上
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

448
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,660
- 等等! 驴子没有袖子 - 你明白我的意思
- Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. - You know what I mean.

449
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,410
你不能对我说你怕高
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

450
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,080
在沸腾岩浆湖摇晃的桥上走我不舒服
I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling lake of lava!

451
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,210
别怕 驴子我就在你身边
Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay?

452
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,960
帮助和鼓励你
For emotional support,

453
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,590
我们一起来通过 一次迈一婴儿小步
we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.

454
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,600
- 真的? - 真的 真的
- Really? - Really, really.

455
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,890
- 这样我感觉好多了 - 往前走
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better. - Just keep moving.

456
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,560
- 别往下看 - 别往下看 别往下看
- And don't look down. - Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

457
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,020
别往下看 往前走 别往下看
Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down.

458
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,900
史瑞克! 我在往下看!
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

459
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,910
我过不去了! 请放了我吧!
Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!

460
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,530
- 你已经走了一半了! - 我知道那部分安全!
- But you're already halfway. - But I know that halfis safe!

461
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,410
好 我没有时间 你回去吧
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

462
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,920
- 史瑞克! - 等等!
- Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey

463
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,080
- 我们交换一下儿位置 - 别这样!
- Let's have a dance then, shall we? - Don't do that!

464
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,050
对不起 别哪样?
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

465
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,220
- 这样? - 对 那样
- Oh, this? - Yes, that!

466
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,720
怎么了? 就这样 好
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

467
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,100
不 史瑞克
No, Shrek!

468
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,310
- 不! 停下! - 你说就这样! 我在这样做啊
- No! Stop it! - You said do it! I'm doin' it.

469
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,650
史瑞克 我要死了 我要死了
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

470
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,230
哦
Oh!

471
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,320
这就行了 驴子这就行了
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

472
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,950
酷
Cool.

473
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,790
那么喷火的家伙在哪里?
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?

474
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,620
在里面 等我们来救她
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

475
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,630
我说的是那条龙 史瑞克
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

476
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,020
你怕吗?
You afraid?

477
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,400
不怕 但
No, but Shh.

478
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,030
嗯 我也不怕
Oh, good. Me neither.

479
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,490
害怕并不是过错
'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid.

480
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,830
害怕是对陌生环境的敏感反应
Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation.

481
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,950
陌生的危险环境
Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add.

482
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,660
有一条喷火的龙
With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire,

483
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,210
害怕并不意味着你是胆小鬼
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared.

484
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,300
我确信史瑞克不是胆小鬼
I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

485
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,720
驴子 两件事 好吗?
Donkey, two things, okay?

486
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,340
闭 嘴
Shut... up.

487
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,180
闭嘴 去看看能不能找到楼梯
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.

488
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,890
楼梯? 我以为我们在找公主
Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

489
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,700
她在楼上在最高塔内最高的房间里
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.

490
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,320
- 你怎么知道她在那里? - 我从书上看到的
- What makes you think she'll be there? - I read it in a book once.

491
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,330
酷 你对付龙 我来找楼梯
Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs.

492
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,460
等我找到楼梯 我也要抽它们的屁股
I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too.

493
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,500
它们并不知道该去哪里
Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.

494
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,970
我要走难走的路
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

495
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,840
别打扰我 我是爬楼梯老手
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master.

496
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,510
我已经征服楼梯了 踏上一步就没有问题了
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.

497
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,220
至少我们知道公主在哪里 但哪里
Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the

498
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,560
喷火龙!
Dragon!

499
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,410
驴子当心!
Donkey, look out!

500
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,050
抓住你了!
Got ya!

501
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,560
哇 哇 哇
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

502
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:13,160
哦 啊啊
Oh! Aah! Aah!

503
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,250
哦 不 不
No. Oh, no. No!

504
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,960
你的牙齿真大
Oh, what large teeth you have.

505
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,890
我是说 闪亮的牙齿 你也许经常听人这么夸奖
I mean, white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all the time from your food,

506
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,400
但你一定漂白了 因为你的笑很耀眼
but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there.

507
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,680
我闻到了 是薄荷味吗?
Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

508
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,520
你知道吗? 你是条雌龙!
And you know what else? You're You're a girl dragon!

509
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,110
当然! 我是说 当然你是雌龙
Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon.

510
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,990
你散发着女性的美
You're just reeking of feminine beauty.

511
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,410
你怎么了? 眼里掉进东西了?
What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye?

512
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,330
噢
Ooh. Oh. Oh.

513
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,830
我真的愿意留下 但
Man, I'd really love to stay, but, you know, I'm, uh

514
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,880
我有气喘病如果你吐烟圈我会受不了的
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings.

515
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
史瑞克!
Shrek!

516
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,670
不 史瑞克! 史瑞克!
No! Shrek! Shrek!

517
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,670
史瑞克
Shrek!

518
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,370
哦 哦
Oh! Oh!

519
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,380
- 醒醒! - 什么?
- Wake up! - What?

520
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,090
你是菲奥纳公主吗?
Areyou Princess Fiona?

521
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,510
是 我在等待一个勇敢的骑士来救我
I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

522
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,590
很好 我们走吧!
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

523
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
等等 骑士先生
But wait, Sir Knight.

524
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,060
这是我们第一次见面
This being our first meeting.

525
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,850
这不该是一个非常浪漫的时刻吗?
Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?

526
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,270
- 是 对不起 女士没时间 - 你在干什么?
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. - Hey, wait. What are you doing?

527
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,440
你应该抱起我
You should sweep me off my feet...

528
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,900
冲出远处的窗户 落在你勇敢的马上
out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

529
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,780
你有很多时间计划这些 是不是?
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

530
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,120
嗯
Mm-hmm.

531
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,080
但我们得品尝这个时刻!
But we have to savour this moment!

532
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,920
你该给我背段壮丽的诗
You could recite an epic poem for me.

533
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,460
叙事史诗? 14行诗!
A ballad? A sonnet!

534
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,800
- 5行打油诗? 或是别的! - 我并不这样认为
- A limerick? Or something! - I don't think so.

535
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,300
至少我该知道英雄的名字吧?
Can I at least know the name of my champion?

536
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,300
我叫史瑞克
Um, Shrek.

537
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,000
史瑞克先生
Sir Shrek.

538
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,790
我祈求你把这个手帕当作我感谢的象征
I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude.

539
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,070
谢谢
Thanks!

540
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,910
你没有杀死龙?
You didn't slay the dragon?

541
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,450
- 这在我们的计划内 - 来!
- It's on my to do list. - Now come on!

542
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,120
但不该这样!
But this isn't right!

543
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,450
你应该像其他骑士一样 在他们被烧死前 冲锋陷阵 挥剑拔刀
You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.

544
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,320
所有的骑士都应该这样
That's what all the other knights did.

545
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,000
在他们被烧成焦炭之前对吧?
Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

546
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,400
这不是问题所在
That's not the point. Oh!

547
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,170
你去哪里? 出口在那边儿
Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.

548
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,300
我要救我的驴子
Well, I have to save my ass.

549
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,600
你是什么骑士?
What kind of knight are you?

550
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,100
独一无二的骑士
One of a kind.

551
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,560
慢点儿 慢点儿 宝贝儿
Slowdown. Slowdown, baby, please.

552
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,550
时间久了才能全面了解一个人
I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time.

553
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,120
就叫我老古板吧
Just call me old fashioned.

554
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,110
我不想仓促拥有肉体关系
I don't want to rush into a physical relationship.

555
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,660
我感情上还没有投入这
I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this

556
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,030
伟大是我要找的字
Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for.

557
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,620
伟大 这是不想要的肉体关系
Magnitude Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

558
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,160
你在干什么?
Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,500
让我们回头一步一步地来
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time.

560
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,710
我们真的应该先做个朋友或者笔友
We really should get to know each other first as friend sorpenpals.

561
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,010
我经常在路上旅行 但我喜欢接收明信片
I'm on theroada lot, but I just love receiving cards

562
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,510
我确实想留下 但
I'd really love to stay, but

563
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,180
别这样! 这是我私人的尾巴
Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail.

564
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,690
你要去掉? 你要用它做什么?
You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission What are you gonna do with that?

565
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,560
现在! 不行 不!
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

566
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,400
不 不 不 不
No, no! No. No, no, no! No! Oh!

567
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,920
- 嗨 公主! - 它会说话!
- Hi, Princess! - It talks!

568
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,060
对 让他闭嘴得用窍门
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

569
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,940
哦
Oh!

570
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,550
好 你们俩 朝出口前进!
Okay, you two, head for the exit!

571
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,220
我来对付龙
I'll take care of the dragon.

572
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:42,240
快跑
Run!

573
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,490
你成功了! 你救了我!
You did it!

574
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,450
真令人惊叹 你
You rescued me! You're amazing. You're

575
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,290
你太伟大了 你是
You're wonderful. You're...

576
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,670
我得承认 有点儿怪
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

577
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:42,670
但你的行为伟大 心底纯洁
But thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure.

578
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,550
我将永远感激你
I am eternally in your debt.

579
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,970
没有高贵的马 哪里有勇敢的骑士?
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

580
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,730
我希望你听到了这些话 她说我是高贵的马!
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

581
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,800
战斗打赢了
The battle is won.

582
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,570
你可以摘掉头盔了 好骑士先生
You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

583
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,230
- 不? - 为什么不?
- Uh, no. - Why not?

584
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,530
我的头发被压扁了
I have helmet hair.

585
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,820
求你 我想看看救我人的脸
Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

586
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,490
不 不 你不想
No, no, you wouldn't 'st.

587
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,040
可你怎么吻我?
But how will you kiss me?

588
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,870
什么? 这不在工作的要求里
What? That wasn't in the job description.

589
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,340
也许是个奖赏
Maybe it's a perk.

590
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,840
不 是命运 你一定要知道是怎么回事
No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes.

591
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,720
一个被关在塔楼里 由龙看守的公主
A princess locked in a tower and be set by a dragon...

592
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,720
被一个勇敢的骑士搭救了
is rescued by a brave knight,

593
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,100
然后他们分享了真爱的第一个吻
and then they share true love's first kiss.

594
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,270
和史瑞克? 你想等等
Hmm? With Shrek? You think Wait.

595
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,520
你以为他是你的真爱?
Wait. You think that Shrek is your true love?

596
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,610
是啊!
Well, yes.

597
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,110
你以为史瑞克是你的真爱!?
You think Shrek is your true love!

598
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,120
这有什么好笑的?
What is so funny?

599
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,290
我不是你喜欢的类型
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

600
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,870
你是 你救了我
Of course, you are. You're my rescuer.

601
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,120
现在 摘掉你的头盔
Now Now remove your helmet.

602
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,710
这不是个好主意
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

603
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,800
- 就把头盔摘掉 - 不
- Just take off the helmet. - I'm not going to.

604
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,050
- 摘掉 现在! - 不!
- Take it off. - No!

605
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,220
- 现在! - 好!
- Now! - Okay!

606
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,800
别发火 听从你的命令 阁下
Easy. As you command, Your Highness.

607
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,880
你 你是个青怪
You You're an ogre.

608
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,880
你以为我像王子一样漂亮?
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

609
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,470
嗯 对 是这样的
Well, yes, actually.

610
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,640
不 都搞错了
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

611
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,399
你不应该是个青怪
You're not supposed to be an ogre.

612
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,699
公主 我是被弗瓜王派来救你的
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

613
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,860
是他想跟你结婚
He's the one who wants to marry you.

614
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,820
那他为什么不来救我?
Then why didn't he come rescue me?

615
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,940
好问题 到那里后你去问他
Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

616
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,050
但我该被真爱的人搭救
But I have to be rescued by my true love,

617
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,880
而不是被妖怪和他的宠物搭救
not by some ogre and his his pet.

618
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:03,010
再也不是高贵的马了
So much for noble steed.

619
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,720
你使我的工作更麻烦了
You're not making my job any easier.

620
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,180
对不起 你的工作不是我的问题
I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

621
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,520
你去告诉弗瓜王 如果他想体面地救我
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly,

622
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,940
我就在这里等他
I'll be waiting for him right here.

623
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,070
我不是个送信的 我是个送货的
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

624
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,410
你不敢
You wouldn't dare.

625
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,490
- 把我放下! - 你来吗 驴子?
- Put me down! - Ya comin', Donkey?

626
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,540
我就在你后面
I'm right behind ya.

627
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,210
放下我 不然你将自食其果!
Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences!

628
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,790
这太没有尊严了! 放下我!
This is not dignified! Put me down!

629
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,760
现在又有个问题
Okay, so here's another question.

630
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,880
有个女人她喜欢你 但你不喜欢她
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way.

631
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:45,340
怎么才能容易地摆脱她而不让她受伤害呢?
How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt,

632
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,930
而你也不会她所伤害或吃掉?
butyou don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?

633
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,770
就告诉她 她不是你真爱的人
You just tell her she's not your true love.

634
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,560
当发现了真爱时 每个人都明白会
Everyone knowest what happens when you find your

635
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,230
嘿
Hey!

636
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,610
越早赶到杜洛克越好
The soonerwe get to DuLoc the better.

637
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,610
你会喜欢那里的 那里很美丽!
You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

638
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,450
我的未婚夫弗瓜王怎么样? 他长得什么样?
And what of my groom to be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

639
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,660
我这样来说吧 公主
Let me put it this way, Princess.

640
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,750
像弗瓜王那样的人很少
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.

641
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,920
我不知道 有人很少瞧见他
I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

642
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,920
停下 你俩都停下
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

643
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,970
你们是在嫉妒 你们没法跟弗瓜王比
You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

644
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,970
对 也许你说得对 公主
Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.

645
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,350
但明天见到他时 你最好亲自量量他
But I'll let you do the measuring when you see him tomorrow.

646
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,650
明天? 要等那么久啊?
Tomorrow? It'll take that long?

647
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,440
- 我们停下露营吧? - 不 那会更久
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp? - No, that'll take longer.

648
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,950
- 我们接着走吧 - 但树林里可能有强盗
- We can keep going. - But there's robbers in the woods.

649
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,370
停下! 露营现在听起来不错!
Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

650
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,540
我比这个森林里任何的东西都更可怕
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.

651
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,000
我要找个地方露营!
I need to find somewhere to camp now!

652
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,970
- 哎!过来 - 史瑞克 我们可以找个更好的地方
- Hey! Over here. - Shrek, we can do better than that.

653
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,640
我认为这对一位公主并不合适
I don't think this is fit for a princess.

654
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,520
不 不 太完美了 它只不过需要一点家的气氛
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

655
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,520
家的气氛? 像什么?
Homey touches? Like what?

656
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,860
一扇门? 好吧 绅士晚安
A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

657
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,320
睡前我跟你讲个故事吧 我会讲
You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

658
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,740
我说晚安!
I said goodnight!

659
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,160
史瑞克 你在做什么?
Shrek, what are you doing?

660
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,290
我只是你知道哦 别担心
I just You know Oh, come on.

661
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,000
我只是开玩笑的
I was just kidding.

662
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,880
呃 那个 那是斯洛白克
And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,

663
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,390
是唯一一个吐过三个麦地的妖怪
the only ogre to ever spit over three wheatfields.

664
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,560
对 好
Right. Yeah.

665
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,560
哎 你能看星象说出我的未来吗?
Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

666
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,230
星象不能告诉我们未来 它们告诉我们故事
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories.

667
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,900
看 布拉纳特臭气
Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent.

668
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,610
- 你可以猜出为什么它很出名 - 你在编造
- You can guess what he's famous for. - I know you're making this up.

669
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,410
不 看 它在那里
No, look. There he is,

670
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,580
猎人都被它臭跑了
and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.

671
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,250
它们只是一群小星星
That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

672
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,250
有时候事情不像表面上看起来那么简单
Sometimes things are more than they appear.

673
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,500
呃?
Hmm?

674
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,630
算了吧
Forget it.

675
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,220
哎 史瑞克 回到沼泽地之后我们做什么?
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

676
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,100
我们的沼泽地?
Our swamp?

677
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,270
你知道 我们救了公主
You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

678
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,100
我们? 驴子不是我们 没有我们
We? Donkey, there's no we. There's no our.

679
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,440
那是我的沼泽地
There's just me and my swamp.

680
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,780
我要做的第一件事就是在我的领土建一个十英尺高的围墙
The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.

681
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,360
你伤害了我 史瑞克
You cut me deep, Shrek.

682
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,780
你刚才深深的伤害了我
You cut me real deep just now.

683
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,780
你知道我在想什么吗?
You know what I think?

684
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,000
我想围墙只是为了堵人
I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

685
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,250
- 不 你怎么想? - 你在隐瞒什么吗?
- No, doya think? - Are you hidin' something?

686
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,290
别介意 驴子
Never mind, Donkey.

687
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,800
哦 这是另一个洋葱的问题 不是吗?
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

688
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,470
不 这是一个不该谈的事情
No, this is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.

689
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:16,310
- 为什么你不想说这个? - 为什么你想?
- Why don't you want to talk about it? - Why do you want to?

690
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,180
- 为什么你要封闭你自己? - 我没有
- Why are you blocking? - I'm not blocking.

691
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,520
- 哦 是的 你有 - 驴子我警告你
- Oh, yes, you are. - Donkey, I'm warning you.

692
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,100
- 你想堵住谁? - 所有人! 行了吧?
- Who you trying to keep out? - Everyone! Okay?

693
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,820
哦 我们现在有所进展了
Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

694
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,200
哦 看在圣彼得的面上
Oh! For the love of Pete!

695
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,700
你的问题是什么? 你对世界有什么不满吗?
What's your problem? What you got against the whole world?

696
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,990
不是我有什么不满 知道吗?
I'm not the one with the problem, okay?

697
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,040
是世界遗弃了我
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.

698
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,000
人们看见我就会说:啊救命 快跑
People take one look at me and go, Aah! Help! Run!

699
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,840
一个愚蠢而又丑陋的怪物
A big, stupid, ugly ogre!

700
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,130
他们不了解我就下了结论
They judge me before they even know me.

701
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,130
这就是为什么我最好离开
That's why I'm better off alone.

702
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,270
你知道什么?
You know what?

703
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:09,020
当我们见面是 我不认为你是一个愚蠢而又丑陋的怪物
When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

704
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,030
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know.

705
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,530
那 呃 天上有驴子吗?
So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

706

是的 那里有 是个多嘴
Well, there's, um, Gabby,

707
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,370
麻烦的小驴子
the Small and Annoying.

708
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:26,380
好的 我现在看到了 那个大的闪闪发光的 就在那里 那里的那个吗?
Okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?

709
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,630
- 那是月亮 - 哦 是的
- That's the moon. - Oh, okay.

713
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,960

Ah. Perfect.

714
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,150
嗯 你知道 我喜欢这样
Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

715
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,490
- 对 宝贝 我说过我喜欢这样 - 驴子醒醒
- Come on, baby. I said I like it. - Donkey, wake up.

716
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,120
- 呃 什么? - 起来了
- Huh? What? - Wake up.

717
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,160
- 什么? - 早上好
- What? - Good morning.

718
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,500
你喜欢吃什么样的蛋?
How do you like your eggs?

719
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,540
- 早安 公主! - 这是怎么回事?
- Good morning, Princess! - What's all this about?

720
00:50:33,793 --> 00:50:37,753
昨天我们一开始相处得有点不太好
We kind of got off to a bad start yesterday.

721
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:39,843
我想补偿你一下
I wanted to make it up to you.

722
00:50:39,923 --> 00:50:44,473
毕竟 是你救了我
After all, you did rescue me.

723
00:50:44,553 --> 00:50:47,553
Uh 谢谢了
Uh, thanks.

724
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:51,433
Well 快点吃 我们还有大段路在前头呢
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

725
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:57,853
史瑞克!

Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones.

868
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:12,195
- 没什么好说的 告诉她你的感觉 - 我
- Just go on in and tell her how you feel. - I

869
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:16,751
没什么好说的 还有 即使我要跟她去说
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that,

870
01:00:16,841 --> 01:00:18,751
你知道
well, you know

871
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:22,341
我还是不会去的 因为
and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't

872
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:24,375
她是一位公主 而我是
she's a princess, and I'm

873
01:00:24,376 --> 01:00:27,601
一个妖怪?
An ogre?

874
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:29,875
是的 一个妖怪
Yeah. An ogre.

875
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:34,481
- 你去哪里? - 去找些柴火
- Hey, where you goin'? - To get... more firewood.

876
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,421
公主?
Princess?

877
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:58,211
菲奥娜公主吗?
Princess Fiona?

878
01:01:02,461 --> 01:01:05,301
公主 你在哪里?
Princess, where are you?

879
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:13,061
公主?
Princess?

880
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:18,901
这里不好玩 我不是在玩游戏
It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

881
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:31,541
- 啊! - 哦 不! - 不 救命!
- Aah! - Oh, no! - No, help!

882
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,711
- 嘘! - 史瑞克 史瑞克 史瑞克 - 不 没什么事了 没事了
- Shh! - Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! - No, it's okay. It's okay.

883
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,671
- 公主在哪里? - 驴子我就事公主
- What did you do with the princess? - Donkey, I'm the princess.

884
01:01:37,751 --> 01:01:40,501
- 啊! - 是我 在这个身体里
- Aah! - It's me, in this body.

885
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:43,131
哦 我的上帝! 你吃了公主
Oh, my God! You ate the princess!

886
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:45,131
- 你能听到我吗? - 驴子!
- Can you hear me? - Donkey!

887
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:47,085
- 听着 保持呼吸! 我会把你弄出来的 - 不!
- Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there! - No!

888
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:49,625
- 史瑞克 史瑞克 史瑞克 - 嘘
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! - Shh.

889
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:52,011
- 史瑞克 - 是我
- Shrek! - This is me.

890
01:01:57,141 --> 01:02:00,021
公主?
Princess?

891
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:03,135
发生什么事了? 你怎么
What happened to you? You're, uh, uh,

892
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,135
变样了
uh, different.

893
01:02:05,136 --> 01:02:07,475
- 我变丑了 对吧? - 哦 是的
- I'm ugly, okay? - Well, yeah!

894
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:11,161
是因为你吃的东西吗? 我知道不该吃那些东西
Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

895
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:13,315
- 我说是因为你吃的东西 - 不
- You are what you eat, I said. Now - No.

896
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:17,211
我 我从记事起就这个样了
I I've been this way as long as I can remember.

897
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:19,751
你什么意思?我从未见过你这个样子
What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

898
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:23,001
日落后才会这样
It only happens when the sun goes down.

899
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:28,051
白天一个样 晚上一个样
By night one way, by day another.

900
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:30,181
这是一个规律
This shall be the norm...

901
01:02:30,261 --> 01:02:33,391
知道得到真爱人的吻
untiI you find true love's first kiss...

902
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,891
然后变成他的模样
and then take love's true form.

903
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:41,521
啊真美 我还不知道你会写诗
Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

904
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:43,521
这是诅咒
It's a spell.

905
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:46,191
我小的时候
When I was a little girl,

906
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:48,951
一个巫婆诅咒了我
a witch cast a spell on me.

907
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,571
每天晚上我就会变成这个样
Every night I become this.

908
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:55,331
一个可怕而又丑陋的怪兽
This horrible, ugly beast!

909
01:02:57,831 --> 01:03:02,881
我被放进一间高塔 等待真爱来救我
I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me.

910
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:05,551
这就是为什么明天日落前要跟弗瓜王结婚
That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow...

911
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:09,051
在他见到我以前
before the sun sets and he sees me...

912
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:13,261
像这样
like this.

913
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:16,601
好的 好的 镇静 看 这一点也不坏
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad.

914
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:20,385
我不会撒谎 你是丑 但不会太丑
You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

915
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:23,941
你只是夜晚丑 但是史瑞克却时刻如此
But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

916
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:27,401
但是 驴子我是一位公主
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

917
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:31,071
这不是一位公主该有的长相
and this is not how a princess is meant to look.

918
01:03:31,161 --> 01:03:34,911
公主 你不跟弗瓜王结婚怎么样?
Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

919
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,911
我必须
I have to.

920
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:39,831
只有真爱的人的吻才能解除咒语
Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

921
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:43,461
但是 你是一个善良的怪兽
But, you know, um, you're kind of an ogre,

922
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:46,961
而且 史瑞克 你们有很多共同点
and Shrek well, you got a lot in common.

923
01:03:47,051 --> 01:03:48,075
史瑞克?
Shrek?

924
01:03:48,076 --> 01:03:52,471
公主 我首先 你好吗?
Princess, I Uh, how's it going, first of all?

925
01:03:52,551 --> 01:03:55,351
好?我很好
Good? Um, good for me too.

926
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,351
我很好
I'm okay.

927
01:03:57,431 --> 01:04:02,311
我看到这些花想到你 因为花很漂亮
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and

928
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:06,651
我不怎么喜欢 但是我想你会喜欢 因为你很漂亮
well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty.

929
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:09,941
但是我仍然很喜欢 我
But I like you anyway. I'd uh, uh

930
01:04:12,111 --> 01:04:15,661
我遇到麻烦了 好的 我们走吧
I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

931
01:04:15,741 --> 01:04:17,775
我不能随便嫁人的
I can't just marry whoever I want.

932
01:04:17,776 --> 01:04:20,621
看着我 驴子
Take a good look at me, Donkey.

933
01:04:20,701 --> 01:04:22,621
我是说 真的
I mean, really,

934
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:25,381
谁会爱上一个丑八怪?
who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?

935
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,881
公主和丑八怪不能在一起
Princessand ugly don't go together.

936
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:30,381
这就是为什么我不能跟史瑞克在一起
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

937
01:04:30,461 --> 01:04:34,891
我唯一的机会就是跟我真爱的人结婚
My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

938
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:38,391
你不明白吗 驴子?
Don't you see, Donkey?

939
01:04:38,471 --> 01:04:41,295
我必须这么做
That's just how it has to be.

940
01:04:41,296 --> 01:04:44,901
这是解除咒语的唯一办法
It's the only way to break the spell.

941
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,265
- 你至少告诉史瑞克真相吧 - 不!
- You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. - No!

942
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:50,731
你不能说一个字 没有人知道这个秘密
You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

943
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,475
如果要保密为什么要告诉我?
What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

944
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:56,161
答应我不说 发誓
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

945
01:04:56,241 --> 01:04:59,331
好的 好的 我不会告诉他 但是你可以说
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

946
01:04:59,411 --> 01:05:01,945
我知道在此结束之前 我需要接受治疗
I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious the rapy.

947
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:06,041
瞧 我的眼睛在抽搐
Look at my eye twitchin'.

948
01:05:28,176 --> 01:05:32,385
告诉他 不告诉他
I tell him, I tell him not.

949
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:36,951
告诉他 不告诉他
I tell him, I tell him not.

950
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,951
告诉他
I tell him.

951
01:05:39,031 --> 01:05:41,121
史瑞克!
Shrek!

952
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:43,751
史瑞克 有些事 我想
Shrek, there's something I want

953
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,771
史瑞克
Shrek.

954
01:06:08,191 --> 01:06:10,231
- 你还好吧? - 非常好!
- Are you all right? - Perfect!

955
01:06:10,311 --> 01:06:12,271
空前良好
Never been better.

956
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:15,185
我 我不有些事情我要告诉你
I I don't There's something I have to tell you.

957
01:06:15,186 --> 01:06:18,281
你不用告诉我任何事情 公主
You don't have to tell me anything, Princess.

958
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:20,451
- 我昨晚听的够多的了 什么 - 你听见我的谈话了?
- I heard enough last night. - You heard what I said?

959
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:22,451
每一个字
Every word.

960
01:06:22,531 --> 01:06:24,235
我想你能理解
I thought you'd understand.

961
01:06:24,236 --> 01:06:26,235
我理解
Oh, I understand.

962
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:29,905
就像你说的 谁会爱上一个丑八怪?
Like you said, Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?

963
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:33,131
但是我以为这对你不重要
But I thought that wouldn't matter toyou.

964
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:34,961
是吗? 重要
Yeah? Well, it does.

965
01:06:37,551 --> 01:06:39,761
准时到达
Ah, right on time.

966
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:42,721
公主 我给你带来个小玩意
Princess, I've brought you a little something.

967
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:50,211
我错过了什么吗? 我错过了什么吗?
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

968
01:06:52,101 --> 01:06:53,521
是谁说的? 不可能事驴子
Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

969
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:57,361
公主
Princess Fiona.

970
01:06:57,441 --> 01:07:00,161
按照承诺 给我地契
As promised. Now hand it over.

971
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:04,491
好的 妖怪 你沼泽地的地契已经写好了
Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, asagreed.

972
01:07:04,581 --> 01:07:09,121
在我改变主意之前拿走吧
Take it and go before I change my mind.

973
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:11,575
原谅我 公主 让你吃惊了
Forgiveme, Princess, for startling you,

974
01:07:11,576 --> 01:07:14,041
但是你也让我吃惊了
but you startled me,

975
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:17,801
我从没有见过这么耀眼的美丽
for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before.

976

简短的告别
a short... farewell.

980
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:38,151
真善良 你不必对那个妖怪那么客气
That is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre.

981
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:40,151
它不懂什么是感情
It's not like it has feelings.

982
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:44,201
你是对的 它不懂
No, you're right. It doesn't.

公主 美丽 洁白无暇的公主
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona.

984
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:51,371
我向你求婚
I ask your hand in marriage.

985
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:56,501
你愿意做我的新娘吗?
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

986
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:04,495
王 我愿意 没有什么
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make

987
01:08:04,496 --> 01:08:08,221
我来计划 我们明天就举行婚礼!

988
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:10,231
不 我是说
No! I mean, uh,

989
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:12,691

让我们在今天日落以前就结婚
Let's get married today before the sun sets.

991
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:19,401
哦 着急了 是吧? 你是对的
Oh, anxious, are we? You're right.

992
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:23,411
越快越好 有很多事情要做
The sooner, the better. There's so much to do!

993
01:08:23,491 --> 01:08:25,355
酒宴 乐队 客人名单
There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list.

994
01:08:25,356 --> 01:08:28,911
队长 列出客人名单!
Captain, round up some guests!

995
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:31,711
再见 妖怪
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

996
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:34,381
史瑞克 你在干什么? 是你让她走得
Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

997
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:36,695
- 是吗? 那又怎么样呢? - 史瑞克 有些事你应该知道
- Yeah? So what? - Shrek, there's something about her you don't know.

998
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,205
我昨晚跟她谈了一夜 她是
Look, I talked to her last night. She's

999
01:08:39,206 --> 01:08:43,801
我知道你跟她昨晚谈了一夜 你们事好朋友 不是吗?
I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren'tya?

1000
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:47,641
如果你们那么要好 你为什么不跟着她走?
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

1001
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,215
史瑞克 我想跟着你
Shrek, I I wanna go with you.

1002
01:08:49,216 --> 01:08:52,731
我告诉过你 你不能跟我回家 我没有说过吗?
I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me.

1003
01:08:52,811 --> 01:08:56,771
我要一个人! 我的沼泽! 我的! 没有其它人!
I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

1004
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:58,941
明白吗? 没有其它人!
Understand? Nobody!

1005
01:08:59,021 --> 01:09:03,395
特别不要无用 可怜 烦人的和会说话的驴子
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

1006
01:09:03,396 --> 01:09:07,121
- 但是 我想知道 - 你想知道什么?
- But I thought - Yeah. You know what?

1007
01:09:07,201 --> 01:09:09,411
你的想法错了
You thought wrong!

1008
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:13,081
史瑞克
Shrek.

1009
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:22,415
我听见一个秘密
I heard there was asecret chord

1010
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:26,011
是戴维说的 来让王高兴
That David played and it pleased the Lord

1011
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:30,931
但是你不是真正想要音乐
But you don't really care formusic, doya

1012
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:36,021
就像第四 第五
I tgoes like this the fourth, the fifth

1013
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:38,651
镜子倒下 主人离开
The minor fall the major lift

1014
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:45,361
困惑的国王
The baffled king composing hallelujah

1015
01:09:45,451 --> 01:09:48,701
Hallelujah

1016
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:52,201

亲爱的 我很早就在那里

我知道我走过的每一个房间
I know this room I've walked this floor

1021
01:10:09,761 --> 01:10:14,851
我过去常常一个人住在认识你之前
I used to live a lone before I knew you

1022
01:10:16,561 --> 01:10:19,651
我看到你的旗帜
I've seen your flag on the marblearch

1023
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:23,071
但是爱情不是胜利的标志
But love is not a victory march

1024
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:27,571
他是冷酷的和毁灭的
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

1025
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:32,331
Hallelujah

Hallelujah

1029
01:10:45,456 --> 01:10:49,841
我在爱情学会的东西
And all lever learned from love

1030
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:51,835
就是如何射中别人
Is how to shoot at someone

1031
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:54,505
射中青睐你的人
Who out drew you

1032
01:10:54,506 --> 01:10:58,771
这就是你今晚听到的喊叫
And it's not a cry you can hear at night

1033
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:01,901
是见不了光的某个人
It's not somebody who's seen the light

1034
01:11:01,981 --> 01:11:09,031
他是残酷的和毁灭的
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

1035
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:11,911
Hallelujah

1036
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:15,241

1039
01:11:33,551 --> 01:11:35,561
驴子?
Donkey?

1040
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,375
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1041
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,891
我想 对每一个人 你要学会认识墙
I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

1042
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:42,901
对
Well, yeah.

1043
01:11:42,981 --> 01:11:45,885
但是墙应该围绕着我的沼泽 而不是穿过
But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

1044
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:49,241
是这样的 这是你的一半 那是我的一半
It is around your half. See, that's your half, and this is my half.

哦 你的一半
Oh! Your half. Hmm.

1046
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:54,065
对 我的一半 我帮助你救了公主
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

1047
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:56,395
我做了一半的工作 我应该得到一半的战利品
I did half the work, I get half the booty.

1048
01:11:56,396 --> 01:12:00,291
现在把那个大石头给我 就是像你脑袋的那个
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

1049
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:02,235
- 退后! - 不 你后退

- 松手 驴子! - 不 你松

1052
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:08,841
- 蠢驴子! - 臭妖怪!
- Stubborn jack ass! - Smelly ogre.

1053
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:11,131

闭上嘴 听我说!
So you just shut up and pay attention!

1058
01:12:22,851 --> 01:12:24,811
你对我总是很刻薄
You are mean to me.

1059
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:26,925
你侮辱我而且我做的事你不领情
You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do!

1060
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:30,095
你总是把我推来推去
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

1061
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:34,491
是吗 如果我对你这么坏 你为什么还要会来?
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

因为我们是朋友 朋友是会原谅彼此的

你把自己包裹了好几层 你害怕你自己的感觉
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

1066
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:54,655
- 走开! - 你又那么做了
- Go away! - There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona.

1067
01:12:54,656 --> 01:12:56,625
就像对公主一样 她喜欢你 也许是爱你
All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

1068
01:12:56,626 --> 01:13:01,311
爱我? 她说我是一个丑八怪

1073
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:14,505
那她说的是谁?
Well, then who was she talking about?

1074
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,771
我不会说一个字 反正你也没有兴趣听
Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me.

1075
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,141
- 真的吗? 真的吗? - 驴子!

好吧 我是一个愚蠢而又丑陋的妖怪
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

1080
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,891
你能原谅我吗?
Can you forgive me?

1081
01:13:43,101 --> 01:13:45,021

公主是怎么说我的
what did Fiona say about me?

1086
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:58,450
你为什么问我 你应该去问她
What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

1087
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:00,985
婚礼!我们别错过这个

- 把他们两个都赶走 - 不 不
- Get them both! - No, no!

1153

直到你找到真爱并得到他的吻
Until you find true love's first kiss...

1178
01:19:51,301 --> 01:19:54,601
然后变成他的模样
and then take love's true form.

1179
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:21,081
变成他的模样 变成他的模样

你应该更漂亮

01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:49,991
你很漂亮
But you are beautiful.

我希望是一个幸福的结局

我想爱情是神话故事中唯一真实的东西

对别人有意义 但是对我没有
Meant for someone else but not for me

1191
01:21:10,971 --> 01:21:13,931
爱情不会光顾我
Love was out to get me
