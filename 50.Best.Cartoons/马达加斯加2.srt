1
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:29,924
干得好，哥们，看来早餐有冰冻寿司吃了
Well done, boys. Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:52,106
儿子，这儿
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:55,514
看见这狮子吗？过来抓他
See the lion? Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,021
儿子，如果你长大以后
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:05,460
像你老爹一样，你要学会如何搏斗
and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,128
大大
Da-da.

7
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:11,800
阿拉凯，我给你看点东西
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?

8
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,298
你看见这记号了吗？
You see this mark?

9
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,801
你和我是一样的
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:20,373
你长大以后，你会成为狮王，像我一样
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:23,208
现在让我看看你是怎么搏斗的，准备好了吗？
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:25,980
不，阿拉凯，不准跳舞！
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:28,919
你还真自得其乐
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:33,754
你真是个奇怪的小孩，奇怪的一个
You're a strange kid. You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,089
我们再来试一遍
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:38,061
别这样，阿拉凯
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,597
停下来，别这样！
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:44,101
望子成龙，却总是让人失望
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:47,570
马库加，你还想挑战我？
Makunga. You're not challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:52,042
往好处想，等我击败你当了狮王
Look on the bright side. After I defeat you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,238
你就可以整天陪着你那可悲的儿子了
you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:00,614
在我狂扁你之前，我先问问你：
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,279
你为什么总是想当狮王？
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:06,620
我比你帅，发型比你美，也比你聪明…
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,023
…我还想让所有人对我唯命是从
...and I want everyone else to do what I say.

26
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:13,362
数到三，我就上了，一…
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:17,532
注意，阿拉凯，看着老爸是怎么教训他的
Pay attention, Alakay. Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:19,200
二，三！
Two, three!

29
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:44,158
- 谁才是狮王？ - 是你
- Who's the alpha lion? - You are.

30
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,224
你可别再忘了
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:49,399
看好了，阿拉凯，这才叫实力…
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:51,861
阿拉凯？
Alakay?

33
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,399
（动物保护区） （禁止捕猎）

34
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:00,734
对了，过来，小猫咪
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

35
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,641
这个漂亮
This one's a beauty.

36
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,974
能值几个钱的
He'll be worth a few bucks.

37
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,246
越来越简单了
It just gets easier and easier.

38
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,518
爸爸！
Daddy!

39
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,582
阿拉凯！阿拉凯！
Alakay! Alakay!

40
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,993
阿拉凯！
Alakay!

41
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,590
大大！
Da-da!

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,091
不要啊！不要啊！
No! No! No!

43
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,263
阿拉凯！
Alakay!

44
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:42,010
- 爸爸！ - 爸爸来了！别怕！
- Daddy! - Daddy's got you! Hold on!

45
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,449
大大！

00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:05,132
阿拉凯！
Alakay!

47
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,648
爸爸！
Daddy!

片名：马达加斯加2：逃往非洲

49
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,520
（捕鱼捞起小狮子）
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

50
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:30,725
- 我不喜欢他的样子 - 他有点可爱的
- I don't like the looks of this guy. - He's kind of cute.

51
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,990
他有点炫耀
He's kind of a showoff.

52
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:35,396
你觉得他可爱？
You think he's cute?

53
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,743
嗷！！
Roar!!

54

纽约之王…
The King of New York City...

55
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:56,585
…雄狮阿历克斯
...Alex the Lion!

56
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,817
我还是觉得他有点炫耀
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

57
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:01,956
他是个动物
The guy's an animal.

58
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:06,019
也许他需要轻松一下 我们也需要度个假什么的
Maybe he should take a break. You know, we could all use a vacation.

59
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:08,088
少来了，我们能去哪里度假？
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

60
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:11,699
我不知道你要去哪，我可想去康涅狄格州
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!

61
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:15,963
包括世界闻名的雄狮阿历克斯在内的几只动物
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion,

62
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,134
今晚从中央动物园逃脱

63
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,441
动物们被追逃进了中央车站
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.

64
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,614
他是只讨厌的小猫
He was a very bad kitty.

65
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,646
动物保护组织曾说服动物园
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials

66
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,984
将动物们送去非洲
to have the animals sent to Africa,

67
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:34,388
他们如今惊讶的获知，运载动物们去非洲的货船

68
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,051
今天据悉在海上失踪

00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:40,223
今晚，数百纽约市民在动物园聚集
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo

70
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,892
哀悼他们喜爱的动物们

71
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:46,926
每个人都在想， 他们现在在哪呢？
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?

72
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:40,781
大家一起来，你们都会唱的，不老套的
Come on! Y'all know this one! It never gets stale!

73
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:46,052
我们会想念你们这些小毛球的 你们真是好听众
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets! You've been a great crowd!

74
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,530
很荣幸能教会你们如何用马桶
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.

75
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,694
如果你们要来曼哈顿拜访，随时给我们打电话
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.

76
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:56,366

00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,472
安静点，诸位
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

78
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,568
你们不尝尝这个就走可不行
You can't leave without this!

79
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,940
很惊喜吧，怪胎们！
Surprise, freaks!

80
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,707
摇起来，摇起来
Shake it! Shake it.

81
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,613
看，我是个美女，我是个美女，一起来
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

82
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,053
我是个美女，假的啦，是我，朱利安国王
I'm a lady! Not really! It's me, King Julien!

83
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:19,295
谁被我迷倒啦？举手
Which of you is attracted to me? Hands up!

要的，多谢，那是我的飞机！

87
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:38,409
在我从新大陆带回纪念品之前…
Until I return with the spoils from the new country...

88
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,583
…史迪威是老大！
...Stevie will be in charge!

89
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:48,419
我觉得他们不太喜欢这个主意啊
I don't think they like that idea.

90
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,751
你说什么，史迪威？
What are you saying, Stevie?

91
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,688
不会吧
No.

92
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:58,202
可以吗？不是吧！这怎么可能？
Could we? No, you didn't say that! How is that even possible?

93
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,137
真是小淘气！史迪威说…
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

94
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,207
把蛋糕给他们吃吧！
Let them eat cake!

95
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:07,210
朱利安国王，等等我！
King Julien, wait for me!

00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,543
我已经收拾好了！旅程也计划好了！
I'm all packed! I have a whole itinerary planned!

97
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:13,611
啊，是莫特！烦人的家伙！
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

98
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,853
别让他上来，抓住他！
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

99
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,946
他带着剪刀和护手霜！
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

100
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,953
大家都进去，快点，快进去！
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in! Get in quick!

101
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,495

你们这些傻瓜！
You guys!

105
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,969
想都别想
Oopsie-daisy!

106
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,976
这肯定是我见过的第二大的弹弓了
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.

107
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,474
不过没办法啦，全体注意
But it'll have to do. Attention.

108
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,149
我是机长
This is your captain speaking.

109
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:49,376
一旦发生紧急情况，请穿上救生夹克
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head

110
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,315
然后和这个世界说再见
then kiss your... good-bye.

111
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,588
纽约，我们来了！
New York City, here we come!

112
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:56,388
请向各路神仙祈祷这破烂能飞起来吧
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.

113
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:58,595
各路神仙？破烂？说什么？
Personal God, hunk? What?

114
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,987
启动了，机长
We are go, sir.

115
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,166
开门！我还没进去！
Open the door! I'm outside!

116
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,163
如果机舱失压
If cabin pressure is lost,

117
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:09,931
请戴上面具，别让人看见你吓得要死
place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.

118
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:14,167
对不起，小姐，这带子不该是连在座位上的吗？
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?

119
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,677
- 不是，先生 - 好了，小伙子们，发射！
- No, sir. - OK, boys, launch!

120
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,313
发射！
Launch!

121
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,510
- 发射！ - 发射！
- Launch! - Launch!

122
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:02,886
有鬼！
Gremlin!

123
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,728
嗨，莫特
Hey, Mort.

124
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,992
嗨！
Hi!

125
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:15,127
真奇怪
That was weird.

126
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,467
- 有人还没睡醒 - 我觉得我刚才看见莫特在机翼上
- Somebody's dreaming. - I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

127
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,574
是你太想念马达加斯加了
You got Madagascar on the brain.

128
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,177
我一定会想的
I know I'm gonna miss it.

129
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:26,615
那儿是很不错，不过我觉得 我们离的越远记忆越美好
It was incredible. I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.

130
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:28,345
哪种美好？就像你咬了我屁股那样？
Like when you bit me on the butt?

131
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:32,856
我会把你念念不忘的这事用在舞台上
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.

132
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:36,690
算是我的沙拉吧台上的情感点心吧
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.

133
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,590
我的屁股也算是吧台上的点心吗？ （上集阿历克斯曾因饥饿咬了马蒂的屁股）
Are the butts next to the croutons?

134
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,862
你不必处处讽刺我吧
You don't need to be sarcastic.

135
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:47,371
等我们回去了，我想要参加相亲计划
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.

136
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,496
相亲计划？
Breeding program?

137
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,701
我们已经够年纪谈婚论嫁了
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.

138
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,210
应该安定下来，发展一段感情
Settle down, have a relationship.

139
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,404
看得出来
I can see that.

140
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,745
什么感情？约会吗？
What? Like dating?

141
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,374
没错，是约会
Yeah, dating.

142
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,976
和…和别人？
Other... other guys?

143
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:06,283
什么叫“和别人”？
What do you mean, other guys?

144
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,125
糟了！
Darn it!

145
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:15,288
餐饮服务怎么拖了这么久还没来？！
What is holding up that beverage service?!

146
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,464
我去看看
I'm gonna go check.

147
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,995
你们继续聊吧，我得睡一会
You all keep talking. I'm gonna catch a few winks.

148
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,972
真好笑！
It's so funny!

149
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:28,010
我喜欢开怀大笑！笑起来…
I like laughing! It's such a nice experience!

150
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,307
真有意思！
To laugh!

151
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,142
能麻烦你回去吗？ 这里是头等舱
Do you mind going back? This is first class.

152
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,021
我可不是针对你，不过我们可比你高贵多了！
It's nothing personal. We're just better than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

153
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,458
那是维瓦尔第吗？
- He shoots, he scores! - Is that Vivaldi?

154
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,258
- 机舱奴隶 - 您有什么需要，马克维茨先生
- In-flight slave. - Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

155
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,026
用银盘子把我的坚果端上来
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

156
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,227
我只是想问问 我们要的饮料好了没有
We were checking on our drink order.

157
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,493
对不起，人手不够
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

158
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:56,136
- 那我还是回去… - 你身子在哪？
- I guess I'll go back... - Where's your body?

159
00:12:56,274 --> 00:13:00,711
你真是让我不爽！能麻烦你回去吗？
You're freaking me out! Can you please go over there, please?

160
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:03,974
难道这航班没有等级区分的吗？
What happened to the separation of the classes?

161
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:06,848
这些所谓民主之类的东西都是一时的啦
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.

162
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,352
我们去吃点菠萝吧，小可爱
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

163
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,920
机长，看
Skipper, look.

164
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,718
分析一下
Analysis.

165
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:18,956
看起来这个小灯说明有什么异常 比如故障什么的
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.

166
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,225
我倒是觉得一闪一闪的很漂亮 还有催眠效果
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

167
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,288
也对，长官
That too, sir.

168
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,697
好吧，里克？
Right! Rico?

169
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:24,924
飞行手册！
Manual!

170
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:28,797
解决了
Problemo solved.

171
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:31,205
- 我们可能没燃料了 - 你怎么知道的？
- We may be out of fuel. - Why do you think so?

172
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:32,942
一号引擎不转了
We've lost engine one...

173
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,706
二号引擎的火也熄了
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

174
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,540
系好安全带，小伙子们
Buckle up, boys.

175
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,143
别看，宝贝，情况可能变得很糟糕
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

176
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,717
全体注意，我是机长
Attention! This is your captain.

177
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:47,482
我一个好消息和一个坏消息要宣布 好消息是，我们马上要降落了
I have good and bad news. The good news is, we're landing immediately.

178
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,717
坏消息是，我们坠机降落
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

179
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:56,663
你们知道坐飞机这种事是难免的啦
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.

180
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,725
谢谢乘坐企鹅航空
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

181
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:14,582
举手，莫里斯！举起手来更好玩！
Raise your arms, Maurice! It's more fun when you raise your arms!

182
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:19,253
我会飞哦！
I can fly!

183
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:24,187
这次看来躲不掉了，我告诉你 你是我的真心朋友
This could be it, Marty! I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

184
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:27,322
谢谢，哥们，你也是
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

185
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,965
- 那么，那事你也不介意吧？ - 什么事，随便说！
- And you won't mind when I tell you... - Tell me anything!

186
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,832
我摔坏了你的iPod！
I broke your iPod!

187
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:35,599
按键太小，我抓狂了！
The buttons were so small! It made me mad!

188
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:37,937
- 惨绝人寰啊！ - 对不起啦！
- The horror! - I'm sorry!

189
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,870
- 我要杀了你，咬屁股的混蛋！ - 真的是意外啦！
- I'll kill you, butt-biter! - It was an accident!

190
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,669
- 意外啦！ - 混蛋！
- An accident! - Butt-biter!

191
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:44,779
我爱你，格罗丽雅！我一直爱着你！
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

192
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:56,950
就像爱沙滩和读书那样的爱
Like you love the beach. Or a good book. Or the beach.

193
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,630
天啊，宝贝，你抖的像风中落叶
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.

194
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,636
里克，玩够了
Rico, you've had your fun.

195
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,968
拉起来
Pull up.

196
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,569
放下起落架
Gear down.

197
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,715
慢慢的，温柔的触地
Gently. You just want to kiss the ground.

198
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,648
如飞鸟啄食，像温柔爱抚 就像你亲你妹妹那样
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.

199
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,780
我是说，温柔点！
I said, kiss it!

200
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:35,932
现在稍稍刹下车就好了
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

201
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,667
将军
I believe that's checkmate.

202
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:49,335
执行紧急迫降，机翼向上！拉！
Commence emergency landing procedure. Flaps up! Deploy!

203
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,394
哦，我们到了
Oh, we're here.

204
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:10,226
到底怎么回事？
What in the world?

205
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:15,005
飞机哪去了？你们把飞机怎么了？
What happened to the plane? What did y'all do to the plane?

206
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,506
没事，我还活着
I'm OK. I'm alive.

207
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:21,602
我连小睡一会都不行 这不是肯尼迪国际机场
I can't even sleep for a minute. This is not JFK.

208
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,704
科瓦斯基，伤亡报告
Kowalski, casualty report.

209
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,748
只有两名乘客失踪
Two passengers unaccounted for.

210
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,746
结果还不错嘛，干得好，小伙子们
That's a number I can live with. Good landing, boys.

211
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,419
谁说企鹅不能飞的？
Who says a penguin can't fly?

212
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:36,486
嗨，你们这还庆祝？看看飞机
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

213
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:39,195
- 我们会修好的 - 你们要怎么修？
- We'll fix it. - How are you gonna fix this?

214
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:42,096
勇气、口水还有一卷胶带
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

215
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:46,130
我们可以在六到九月内修好
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.

216
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:49,138
- 六十九个月？！ - 不，是六到九个月
- Sixty-nine months?! - No, six to nine months.

217
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:51,936
科瓦斯基，我们要化挫折为力量
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.

218
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:56,272
- 这个数字你是怎么得来的？ - 你负责重新装配
- Where'd you get that number? - I want you to reconfigure the design.

219
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,038
你是怎么估计时间的？
How do you estimate that?

220
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:01,683
你，帅哥，你和你的朋友去挖个厕所先
Pretty boy! Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.

221
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,914
等等，你评什么？
Hold on. Who made you king of the plane wreck?

222
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:09,392
你说什么？好吧，你负责，飞机你来修
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge. You fix the plane.

223
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,826
谁说你有资格让我负责的？
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?

224
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,955
好吧，那么，还是我负责
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

225
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:15,893
没错，你负责吧
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

226
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:18,628
你和你那些朋友别来妨碍我们
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.

227
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:21,535
太对了，因为我决定...
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

228
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:25,473
- 很好 - 听着，这事我们没完
- Good for you. - Well, this discussion isn't over.

229
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,876
高等哺乳生物，你们留下来
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

230
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,971
我们可以用到你们的大脑皮层和可握拳的手
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.

231
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:34,978
菲尔，我该先用肥皂给你洗洗手的
Phil! I should wash your hands out with soap.

232
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,755
这到底…他们要怎么修好飞机？
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?!

233
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,815
勇气和口水
You know, grit and spit and spit.

234
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,759
很多的勇气和口水，众志成城之类
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.

235
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,093
听起来没什么希望
That don't sound too promising.

236
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:49,689
太对了，我们困在这儿了
You're right. We're stuck here.

237
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:53,760
只要我们大家还在一起就没事
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

238
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,103
没错，不过相爱可没法送我们回家
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

239
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,506
看，狮子！
Behold! The lion!

240
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,204
- 大伙们 - 看够了，走吧
- People! - There is much to see. Moving on.

241
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,680
等等，等等，伙计们！
Wait, wait, wait! People!

242
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:08,515
- 他们会帮我们的 - 等等！
- They'll help us! - Wait up!

243
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:11,344
- 伙计们！伙计们！ - 帮帮我们！
- People! Stop! - Help us!

244
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,018
如果你们停下来 我就给你们签名！
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

245
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,623
我认识你！
I know you!

246
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:18,753
你
You.

247
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,854
是那只讨厌的小猫
It's the bad kitty.

248
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:30,865
喜欢这招吗！
How do you like some of that?!

249
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,055
还有这招！
Come in, Tokyo!

250
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,234
正中要害
Right in the batteries.

251
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:03,166
你觉得老奶奶就不能照顾自己？
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?

252
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:06,509
下次我就不会对你这么客气了！
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

253
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,972
谢谢，亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

254
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,577
开车
Moving on!

255
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,084
你疯了吗？我们需要帮助 你却骚扰老太太？
Are you out of your mind? We need help and you harass old ladies?!

256
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:19,312
疯了？
Out of my mind?

257
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:22,248
谁才疯了？
Who's out of my mind now?

258
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,692
- 看看能不能打通 - 没问题
- See if you can get an operator. - No problem.

259
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:28,095
说我疯了，我们要回家了
Out of my mind. We're going home.

260
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,770
消息E-4
Message E-4.

261
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,674

这些斑马…和我一样哦
All those zebras... like me.

265
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,457
- 我们在哪？ - 圣地亚哥

266
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,130
这次我有40%的把握
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

267
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,799
- 我认识这里 - 我觉得是非洲
- I know this place. - I think it's Africa.

268
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:07,025
非洲？
Africa?

269
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:08,635
一定是啦
It's got to be.

270
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,464
我们祖先的摇篮
Our ancestral crib.

271
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,904
这都藏在我们的血脉里，我能感觉到！
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

272
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,635
不，不仅仅是这样…
No, it's more than that. It's like...

273
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:19,814
…像是似曾相识，好像我来过这
...deja vu, like I've been here before.

274
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,642
这就叫寻根！
It's like Roots!

275
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,386
不是，像是…
No, it's like...

276
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,817
…似曾相识，像是我来过这里
...deja vu, like I've been here before.

277
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,828
我是阿历克斯！
Me Alex!

278
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,332
我和我朋友们飞来的
Me and me friends fly,

279
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:45,665
在一个金属大鸟里飞来的
fly in great metal bird.

280
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:49,338
然后掉了下来！
Then plummet!

281
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:51,678
砸到地上！
Smash ground!

282
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,179
嘭！
Go boom!

283
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,511
然后我们相遇了
Then here we emerge.

284

我们只带来快乐

285

和问候
and good greetings.

286
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,023
他是在演坠机吗？
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

287
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,529
没错，我们…没错
Yeah. We just... yeah.

288
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,528
我本来以为…对不起
I thought... Sorry.

289
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,763
你们是从保护区外面来的？
You came from off the reserve?

290
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,871
远得很，我们其实从中央公园动物园来的
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo, actually.

291
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,205
别勉强了
Don't strain yourself.

292
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,645
怎么回事？
What's going on here?

293
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,483
他们说是从保护区外面来的
They say they're from off the reserve.

294
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:34,922
不可能，从保护区外来的只有人
That's impossible. Only people come from off the reserve.

295
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:37,153
你看起来很面熟，我认识你吗？
You look familiar. Do I know you?

296
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:39,752
你们怎么躲过盗猎者的？
How could you survive the hunters?

297
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,162
我们没见到什么偷猎者啊
We didn't see any hunters.

298
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,097
- 你看什么？ - 我？没看什么啊
- What are you looking at? - Me? Nothing.

299
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:47,331
我们的水塘养不起闲人
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.

300
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,903
你们哪来的回哪去
So skedaddle back to where you came from.

301
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,335
你们这儿有什么经理负责吗？
Is there a manager we could talk to?

302
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:55,477
我明白了，你是来挑战我的！
I see. You're here to challenge me!

303
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,236
什么？我没有！
What? No! No.

304
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,142
我觉得是这么回事！
That's what it looks like to me!

305
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,747
祖巴，等等
Zuba! Wait.

306
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,747
你没看我有正事吗…
I'm trying to take care of business...

307
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,482
我知道，祖巴，你等等
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

308
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:07,487
阿拉凯？
Alakay?

309
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:09,589
是你吗？
Is that you?

310
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:13,160
不，是阿历克斯，是“克斯” 纽约尼克斯的那个“克斯”
No, it's Alex. Lx. Like New York Knicks.

311
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,523
祖巴，看！
Zuba, look!

312
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,591
我生来就有，兽医也查过
I've always had that. The vet checked it out.

313
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:20,927
其实是个很漂亮的胎记
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

314
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:22,699
这个记号
A mark.

315
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,269
好吧，气氛好像有点奇怪
All right, this is a little weird.

316
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:29,438
亲爱的，他回来了
Honey, he's come home.

317
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,474
什么？
What?

318
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:33,446
你终于回家了
You've come home.

319
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,850
儿子
Son.

320
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,122
爸爸
Dad.

321
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:55,237
妈妈和爸爸？妈妈和爸爸！
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

322
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:58,638
妈妈和爸爸！是我的妈妈和爸爸！
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

323
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,204
我有妈妈和爸爸了！
I got a mom and dad!

324
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:02,809
我孩子还活着！
My baby's alive!

325
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,411
爸爸！
Dad!

326
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:06,309
我的孩子！
My son!

327
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:09,646
我儿子回来了！
My son is home!

328
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:14,649
阿拉凯！阿拉凯回来了！
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

329
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:23,159
阿拉凯！耶！走失的儿子回来了！太好了！
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns. This is perfect!

330
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,660
我以为你讨厌祖巴的
I thought you hated Zuba.

331
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,436
对，我是讨厌他，没错，我讨厌他
No, I do. I do. I do. I hate him. Oh, I do.

332
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:33,032
我要利用阿拉凯，没错
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

333
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,671
我要利用他来一劳永逸的除掉祖巴
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

334
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,506
快点，长羽毛的马！
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

335
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:41,449
让开，让开路，躲开！
Make way! Move out of the way! Stand aside!

336
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:43,179
纽约！
New York!

337
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,456
有点像垃圾场，你确实这儿不是新泽西吗？
It's a bit of a dump. Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

338
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:50,789
嗨，纽约众！你们的国王来了！
Hello, New Yorkers! Your new king is here!

339
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:53,125
已经举行欢迎仪式了？
This calls for a celebration!

340
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,062
莫里斯，我觉得他们喜欢我
Maurice, I think they like me.

341
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,692
和平移交政权，大家当然喜欢
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!

342
00:24:07,477 --> 00:24:11,607
不要意思，我是马蒂，我刚来这儿
Excuse me. I'm Marty. I'm kind of new around here.

343
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:14,143
嗨，马蒂！
Hey, Marty!

344
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,620
你们这群长得还真帅！ 喜欢跑步吗？
You're a good-looking group! You like to run?

345
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,392
当然，跑步超酷的
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

346
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:26,161
没错，超酷的
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

347
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,256
你们原来和我一样说这种超酷的语言啊
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.

348
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,767
什么？你们这连医生都没有？
What? You don't have doctors here?

349
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:33,325
现在没了
Not anymore.

350
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:35,894
那你们感冒了怎么办？
Well, what if you catch a cold?

351
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:39,067
蹲在等死坑里，等死咯
We go over to the dying holes and we die.

352
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:43,809
你们真的需要个医生
You guys really need a doctor.

353
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:47,078
- 你可以来当啊 - 你有兴趣吗？
- We have an opening. - Would you be interested?

354
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,641
我？当医生？
Me? A doctor?

355
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:57,922
这儿男人遍地跑，你们真幸福
It's raining men. Hallelujah! You all got it going on.

356
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:01,021
你怎么没个男人？你长寄生虫了？
Why dont you have a man? You got worms?

357
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:03,622
早就没了，听着，姑娘们
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

358
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,795
曼哈顿有两样东西紧缺，停车位和河马
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.

359
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,998
嗨，大伙们，我刚发现
Hey, everybody! I just found out that my son

360
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:14,009
原来我儿子已经是一方王者了，纽约之王！
is a doggone king! The King of New York!

361
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:18,811
给我们表演一下，儿子，别害羞
Show me some of your moves, son. Don't be bashful.

362
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:21,544
好吧，这个动作总是迷倒一片
All right. This one always knocks 'em dead.

363
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:23,477
嗷！
Roar!

364
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:27,614
看，狮王发威了，狮王发威了！
Look out. The King is mad. The King is mad!

365
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:32,560
让我们一起欢迎他回归狮群吧！
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!

366
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,064
欢迎加入我们群，马蒂！
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

367
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:41,502
我一直盼着能加入群呢！
Me? I've always wanted to be part of a herd!

368
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:44,904
- 我为人人 - 人人为我
- It's one for all... - [all] And all for all, y'all!

369
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,041
我看起来怎么样？
How do I look?

370
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:53,306
准确的说，巫医鼻子上要穿一根骨头的
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.

371
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,983
别担心，只是卡上去而已
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

372
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:58,716
看啊，他现在是一个巫医了！
Voila! He's a witch doctor!

373
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:01,388
我妈妈一定会为我高兴的
My mother will be so happy.

374
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:09,392
看那，我觉得摩托摩托喜欢你
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

375
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,166
他过来了
Here he comes.

376
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:33,854
天啊，姑娘，你还真壮实啊
Goodness, girl... you huge.

377
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:36,184
你后面跟着谁？还是那只是你的大屁股？
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

378
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:39,618
你不但壮实还很幽默
You as quick as you are hefty.

379
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:42,263
你是摩托摩托？
So you're Moto Moto?

380
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:44,527
我名字太好听了，所以要说两遍
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

381
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,429
我听喜欢的，大牛
I kind of like it, fatso.

382
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:50,701
回见，姑娘，你可不难找，因为你真丰满
I'll see you around, girl. It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.

383
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,450
我不想搅了你们的狂欢，祖巴
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

384
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,986
不过狮群中有人想知道 你什么时候流放你的儿子
but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.

385
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:11,490
- 你说什么，马库加？ - 其实没什么大不了的
- What are you talking about? - It's nothing, really.

386
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:14,189
不过他们抱怨说阿拉凯还没通过…
They're griping that Alakay never went through

387
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,357
入群仪式之类的
the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah,

388
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:21,837
所以严格的说，他还不能加入狮群 这实在是没道理
so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

389
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:24,203
我都忘了入群仪式这事了
I forgot about the rite of passage.

390
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:26,538
那是什么？入群仪式是什么？
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

391
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,135
是一个传统的成年仪式
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

392
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:32,940
年轻的雄狮都要通过仪式来证明自己的力量
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.

393
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:36,747
- 就像选秀那样？ - 没错，展示他们的才能
- A show-of-skill talent show deal? - Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

394
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,948
表演才艺！这事我驾轻就熟
A performance! I think that's up my alley.

395
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:43,857
如果是传统，那我一定要参加 展示才艺，证明自己
If it's tradition, I want to do it. Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

396
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:45,690
我想成为阿拉卡
I want to be Alaki.

397
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:48,094
- 是阿拉凯 - 阿拉凯，这名字更帅
- Alakay. - Alakay! Even better.

398
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:50,759
我们明天一早就举行仪式！
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!

399
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,530
太好了，祝你好运，阿拉凯
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

400
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:55,867
在我们那，我们说“奏凯”
Where Im from, we say, "Break a leg."

401
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,100
我的好儿子！
That's my boy!

402
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,463
真漂亮啊，不是吗？
Beautiful, isn't it?

403
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,525
了不起
It's amazing.

404
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:28,735
伙计们…
Guys...

405
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,464
…这才是该我们生活的地方
...this is where we belong.

406
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,542
游客陷阱行动开始！
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

407
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:37,677
哦，我喜欢
Oh, I like that one.

408
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,476
这个行动得分好多步
It works on many levels.

409
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,346
你们真是群小坏蛋啊
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

410
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:42,908
- 没错 - 当然
- That, too. - Absolutely.

411
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,817
各就各位
Stations.

412
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:46,879
第一步，开始！
Stage one. Go!

413
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:03,429
天啊，我都干了些什么？
Oh, no! What have I done?

414
00:29:03,673 --> 00:29:05,004
快点，上钩吧
Come on, take the bait.

415
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:07,703
- 怎么了？ - 看看这可怜的小家伙
- What happened? - Oh, look at the poor little guy.

416
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:09,335
它死了吗？
Is it dead?

417
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:12,573
第二步！行动！
Stage two! Go, go, go!

418
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:22,785
我要给他一个生命之吻
I will give him the kiss of life.

419
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,450
里克！
Rico!

420
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,494
里克！
Rico!

421
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,067
倒档！
Reverse!

422
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:35,126
油门！
Gas!

423
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:36,467
音乐！
Music!

424
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,866
不，停下！停下！
No! Stop! Stop!

425
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,809
停下！
Stop!

426
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,377
回来！
Come back!

427
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:49,145
哪个混蛋在放摇滚？
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

428
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:56,489
她死了吗？
Is she dead?

429
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,283
没有！
No!

430
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:08,303
你们这些流氓！
You hoodlums!

431
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,172
天啊 ，你还好吗？
Good heavens! Are you OK?

432
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:15,439
女士，我找到了你的手袋
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

433
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:19,243
我的手袋，你真是个好孩子
My handbag. Such a good boy.

434
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,511
奶奶我没有手袋可不行
Nana can't survive without it.

435
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:23,742
老奶奶您还真硬朗啊
You are one tough cookie.

436
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:26,820
扬克斯市416女童子军，报道！
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

437
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,690
大家别惊慌，现在最好的办法 就是大家呆在一起
OK, nobody panic! The best thing we can do is stay together.

438
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,355
等下一辆游客吉普车过来 可能要等几小时，不过…
We'll wait for another tourjeep. It may take hours, but...

439
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:35,523
你去哪？
Where are you going?

440
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:40,995
我可不会在这等野兽来享用！ 奶奶我还没活够呢
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals! I'm too old to die.

441
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:45,866
我得跟她一起去，老奶奶，等等！
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

442
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,676
拜托！我们大家要待在…
Please! We need to stay...

443
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:50,543
…一起
...together.

444
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:53,672
好吧，我们就走这条路！
Fine! We'll go that way!

445
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:56,349
有人想吃糖吗？
Does anyone want a hard candy?

446
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,552
- 慢点 - 注意脚下
- Easy now. - Watch your step.

447
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:07,026
我们到了，你准备好了吗？
And right here... OK, are you ready?

448
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,296
这是你小时候睡觉的地方
This is where you always slept.

449
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:13,029
哦，天啊
Oh, man!

450
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:20,364
- 这是我的吗？ - 看他高兴的，你看，亲爱的
- Was this mine? - Look at you. Look at him.

451
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,806
哦，还有这个，看啊
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

452
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,713
- 我记得这个！ - 他还记得
- I remember this! - He remembers.

453
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:28,706
比我想象中硬一点…
A little harder than...

454
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:32,716
你以前从来不睡床头，只睡床尾
You never slept on the right end. You always slept on the bottom end.

455
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,716
是么？
Is that?

456
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:36,389
这是我留的吗？
Is that my?

457
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:39,726
是我吗？
Is that me?

458
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:42,493
你的小狮爪是最可爱的
You had the cutest little paws.

459
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:45,064
小小的很可爱
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

460
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:48,064
这是你走失那天留下的
You did that the day we lost you.

461
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:52,068
哇，我那时真小
Wow. I was so young.

462
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:54,107
后来怎么了？
What happened to me?

463
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:58,605
都是我的错，就那一瞬间，我没看住你…
It was all my fault. I turned my back and...

464
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,673
不是你的错
It was not your fault.

465
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,944
你爸爸真的尽力了 他追寻那些盗猎者几个星期
Your father did everything he could. He tracked those hunters for weeks.

466
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:07,620
出了保护区很远很远
Far off the reserve.

467
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:10,951
最后，我不得不认为那些盗猎者…
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

468
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,417
他们…
...well...

469
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:16,095
我们觉得他们已经杀了你
We thought they'd killed you.

470
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,767
不过我儿子把他们都击败了！ 谁都别惹纽约之王！
But my son fought them off! Dont mess with the King of New York!

471
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,527
当然了！
- That's right! - Keep your chin in.

472
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:26,970
好啦，小心，别打坏东西
You boys be careful! Watch out before you break something.

473
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:31,243
你以前叫这个“飞飞”
You used to call this "foofie."

474
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:32,804
飞飞？
"Foofie"?

475
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,049
飞飞
Foofie.

476
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,642
他现在不需要了
He doesn't want that.

477
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,312
这是我的飞飞
This is my foofie!

478
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,316
祖巴，你最好把飞飞给他
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

479
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:47,659
哦，不用，谢谢，很好
I mean, no, thank you, thank you. It's perfect.

480
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:51,330
儿子，你早点睡觉，明天你有大事要做
Son, you get your rest. You have a big day tomorrow.

481
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,829
你要恢复体力
You'll need all your strength.

482
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,337
我会让欢呼声把房顶都掀翻的
I will bring the house down for you.

483
00:32:56,806 --> 00:33:00,401
希望如此，否则你爸爸就不得不流放你了
I hope so. Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.

484
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,477
不会吧，妈妈，真的吗？
Jeez, Mom, really?

485
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,738
我知道你会让我们骄傲的 你知道为什么吗？
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

486
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,682
因为你是我的儿子
You were born with it.

487
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:12,678
晚安，阿拉凯
Good night, Alakay.

488
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,684
我的孩子，我亲生的孩子
My boy. My own boy.

489
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,026
我儿子是个大王
My son's a king.

490
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:23,029
我儿子是个大王
My son's a king.

491
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,700
晚安，妈妈
Good night, Mom.

492
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,703
晚安，阿拉凯
Good night, Alakay.

493
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:45,854
飞飞
Foofie.

494
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:48,721
看啊 ，我的飞飞！
Look at foofie! My foofie!

495
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,954
飞飞，飞飞，我的飞飞
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

496
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,531
还没发现人烟，大家都很疲劳
No sign of civilization. Everybody appears very tired.

497
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:00,859
我们好像迷路了
I think we're lost.

498
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,731
老奶奶，你知道你要去哪吗？
Nana, do you know where you're going?

499
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:08,471
不知道，不过我斗志昂扬，面带笑容
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.

500
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:10,877
是吗，那好吧
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

501
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:16,083
-有人了 - 你们怎么在这里？
- It's people. - How did you get here?

502
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:18,814
- 你们能帮帮我们吗？我们迷路了？ - 我们也迷路了啊
- Can you help us? We're lost. - We're lost too.

503
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:23,552
太可怕了，黑白流氓闪电袭击 我们的车被他们抢去了
It was awful. A flash of black and white and they were gone. They took the jeep!

504
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:26,390
- 我们的车也被他们抢去了啊 - 那我们怎么办？
- That happened to our jeep too! - What do we do?

505
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:27,828
我们怎么活下去？
How will we all survive?

506
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:31,890
没有食物，没有水，没有地方住 我们到底该怎么办？
No food, no water, no shelter. What are we gonna do?!

507
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:36,838
你们可以选择让自然征服你们
You can let nature get the best of you,

508
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:39,340
你们也可以征服自然
or you can get the best of nature.

509
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:45,645
大家围过来，孩子们 我们是纽约人，对不对？
Gather 'round, children. We're New Yorkers, right?

510
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:46,977
没错
Yeah.

511
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,508
我们在钢筋水泥的丛林里都生存下来了！
We survive the concrete jungle!

512
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:54,023
需要食物时，我们去找热狗摊
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.

513
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,751
- 是不是？ - 她说得对
- Am I right? - She's right.

514
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:59,261
需要地方住的时候，我们建起了摩天大楼
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.

515
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:03,822
- 说的太好了 - 需要水的时候，我们建起了大坝
- Exactly! - When we need water, we build a dam.

516
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,062
我们是纽约人，我们自豪的高呼！
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

517
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:08,535
我们在纽约能做到的事
If we can make it there,

518
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:11,130
我们在任何地方都能做到
we can make it anywhere!

519
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:29,484
我来了，朱利安国王
I'm coming, King Julien!

520
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,331
大坏鱼！大坏鱼！
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

521
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:42,335
不对，是鲨鱼啊！糟了糟了！
No, shark, no! Sit!

522
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:46,505
我为什么要笑呢？
Why am I laughing?

523
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,448
我们凑齐了全部配件，不过进度有点拖延
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.

524
00:35:54,517 --> 00:35:56,883
- 拖延程度如何？ - 六到九年
- How slightly? - Six to nine years.

525
00:35:56,953 --> 00:36:00,184
- 六十九年？ - 不是，是六到九年
- Sixty-nine years? - No, six to nine years.

526
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:02,989
小兵，我们的猴子呢？
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

527
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,118
他们昨天开始就失踪了
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

528
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:07,025
该死
Darn you, Darwin!

529
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:12,033
竟敢在我眼皮底下溜号，小兵，你跟我来
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch. Private! You're coming with me.

530
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:15,034
里克，你跟我来！
Rico! You're coming with me!

531
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:19,698
- 我要送他们上军事法庭 - 不必了！
- We'll bring them in for court martial. - That won't be necessary!

532
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:23,371
我们帮你们招募了些兄弟，机长
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

533
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:31,717
太好了，我成猴子军长了
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

534
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,886
我可不觉得
Oh, I doubt that.

535
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:42,557
别浪费时间了，我们开始工作吧
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

536
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:46,667
你们分成三组，第一组负责制作机体
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.

537
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:50,967
第二组负责装配，第三组负责后勤
Group Bronson handles assembly. Group George Peppard, craft services.

538
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,405
有什么问题？
Any questions?

539
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:55,233
没有太好了，开始工作吧！
Good! Let's get to work.

540
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:05,418
我真想亲你一口，猴子
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

541
00:37:05,755 --> 00:37:09,247
勉为其难吧，虽然你长得丑
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

542
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:19,834
记住，小家伙们 真正的舞者是用心来表演的
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.

543
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,261
只要用心，你就战无不胜
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.

544
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,200
随便你，先生
Sure, mister.

545
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:30,302
嗨，阿拉凯，我刚好路过，过来给你鼓鼓劲
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.

546
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,872
- 你不会紧张吧？有吗？ - 哪有，我靠这吃饭的
- You're not nervous, are you? - Nah, it's my thing.

547
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,716
在我看来，胜利的关键在于选择对手
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.

548
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:41,052
所以这是PK赛制吗？
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?

549
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:43,183
- PK淘汰赛？ - 对吧
- Like a dance-off? - Sure.

550
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:45,620
太好了，我喜欢自由发挥
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

551
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:49,796
谁够格跟我比？好让比赛精彩点
Who'd be a good match for me? Just to keep things interesting.

552
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,794
这我可帮不上忙
Well, I wish I could help,

553
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:56,630
因为祖宗法纪不允许我多嘴
but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.

554
00:37:56,873 --> 00:38:00,400
不过如果是我的话，我肯定选提西
But if it was me out there... I'd choose Teetsi.

555
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:04,580
提西，好吧，听起来蛮有趣的
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

556
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,137
马库加，对吧？多谢
Makunga, right? Thank you.

557
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,884
你是祖巴的孩子嘛，随时效劳，上去露一手吧
Anything for Zuba's boy. Go get 'em, tiger.

558
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,483
振作精神
Shake it out.

559
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:12,985
五六七八
A five, six, seven, eight.

560
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:15,654
我们上，开始了
Let's go, let's do this.

561
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,501
成年仪式，现在开始
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.

562
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:39,912
- 加油啊，宝贝！让妈妈骄傲一下！ - 别这样，我正要主持…
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud! - Woman, I'm trying to take...

563
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:41,176
没问题，妈妈！
On it, Mom!

564
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,013
谁想第一个上场？
Who will be the first participant?

565
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:45,680
我，哦，让我上，让我上！
Me! Oh! Me, me, me! Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

566
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:48,354
就你吧，又高又帅的这位
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

567
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:50,354
选择你的对手吧
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

568
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:52,688
让我想想
Let me see.

569
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:56,354
我要挑…
I guess I'll pick...

570
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:00,458
…提西？
...Teetsi?

571
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:04,940
提西？他为什么挑提西？
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

572
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:08,541
这才是我儿子，勇敢无畏！
That's my boy! He's got some gumption there!

573
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:11,209
来人，把他叫醒！
Somebody, wake him up!

574
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:27,660
好吧，提西，来吧，我们比试一下
All right, so, Teetsi, come on. Let's do this, huh?

575
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,224
来吧，小提西，让我看看你的实力
Come on, little tsetse fly. Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

576
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,470
- 开始吧！ - 好啊
- Let's dance! - OK.

577
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:37,301
不过我警告你…
But let me warn you that I am a protege of...

578
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:40,235
…我可是霍西和罗宾斯的得意门生
...Fosse and Robbins!

579
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:43,067
不是跳舞，是决斗！
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

580
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:46,245
是斗舞吗？没问题啊
Dance fight! You got it.

581
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,854
- 他是在跳舞吗？ - 他到底在干嘛？
- Is he dancing? - What's he doing?

582
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:57,256
他不可能是在跳舞吧
I know that boy is not dancing.

583
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:00,088
比我想象中顺利多了
This is even better than I thought.

584
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:04,422
阿拉凯，转身
Alakay, turn around!

585
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:08,865
不，老爸，应该是： 小跳、摆头、摇臀然后才是转身
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.

586
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:20,275
哦，不会吧
Oh, no.

587
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,611
阿拉凯，你受伤了吗？
Alakay! Are you hurt?

588
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,614
是的，我受伤了
Yeah, I am.

589
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:27,685
我赢了吗？
Did I... did I win?

590
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,088
当然没有，儿子
No, son.

591
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:31,217
怎么会这样？
How could this happen?

592
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:35,355
你告诉我说你是一方之王 大王可不会打输
You told us you were a king. A king does not get beat.

593
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:39,458
我是大王，我是纽约之王
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

594
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:43,928
那是我的艺名，我上台表演的时候用的
It's my stage name. Like for when I perform.

595
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,166
表演？
Perform?

596
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:49,575
太不幸了，阿拉凯没通过测试
Oh, no, this is horrible! Alakay has failed the test!

597
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:54,810
谁能想象，今天祖巴居然要流放…
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish...

598
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:57,076
…自己的亲儿子？
...his own son?

599
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,212
-祖巴，不要
Zuba, no.

600
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,187
祖巴，要的
Zuba, yes.

601
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,324
很不幸，狮王必须要驱逐不合格的成员
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.

602
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:20,407
那么，我不当这个狮王了
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

603
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,171
爸爸，你干什么？
Dad, what are you doing?

604
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:26,345
爸爸，不要！你别这样
Dad, no! You can't do this.

605
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:31,086
谁能来接替祖巴的位置？
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

606
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:33,348
谁来？
Anyone?

607
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:35,520
有人吗？没人？
Someone? No one?

608
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:37,949
你吗？
You, sir!

609
00:41:38,027 --> 00:41:39,619
恐怕不是
I guess not.

610
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:42,687
虽然这样很不好意思
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

611
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:46,524
不过这个重担还是我来担吧
but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.

612
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:50,536
提西，把帽子拿来
Teetsi! Get the hat.

613
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:56,042
作为新的领袖，我宣布流放阿拉凯！
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!

614
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,370
并且他要戴着耻辱之帽…
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

615
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:01,378
…离开水源
...and leave the watering hole

616
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,208
期限为一千年，或者一辈子
for a thousand years, or life!

617
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:07,215
那个长适用哪个
Whichever comes last.

618
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:13,061
过去，过去，走开！
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

619
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:17,560
你应该先告诉我们 你不是真正的大王，儿子
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!

620
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,200
你也没先告诉我要决斗啊！
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!

621
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:21,566
你以为呢？
What did you expect?!

622
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:26,199
我不知道，也许你该说明白的 “儿子，那可是决斗哦！”
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

623
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:29,073
- 你不是狮子吗？ - 但是我这辈子都没打过架
- You're a lion! - But I never fought another lion!

624
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,045
你当然没有啦，你忙着跳舞呢
No, I guess not. You dance!

625
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:35,174
当然还干别的事，问题是那个马库加给我下了套
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!

626
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:38,015
- 这些都不会发生，如果… - 如果你是只真正的雄狮
- None of this would have happened... - If you were a real lion.

627
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:39,816
- 祖巴！ - 是啊，我就这么说了！
- Zuba! - Yeah, I said it!

628
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,251
真正的雄狮
A real lion.

629
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,591
多谢
Thanks.

630
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,421
真是多谢你
Thanks a lot.

631
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:01,604
锯子
Saw.

632
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,276
缝合线
Suture.

633
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:07,446
擦汗
Swab.

634
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:09,048
你挡住光线了，史蒂文
You're in my light, Stephen.

635
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:11,947
你肩膀上有个褐色斑点
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

636
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:16,716
你观察真仔细啊，不过你看的再仔细一点 你会发现我全身都是斑点
That's very observant, Stephen. As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

637
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:20,451
过几周，骨头就都长好了
OK! That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.

638
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,857
那么我不用去等死了？
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?

639
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:25,397
当然不用，蒂姆，你的人生才刚刚开始
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.

640
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:27,902
- 真的吗？ - 去玩吧
- Really? - Go out and grab it by the horns.

641
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,633
- 谢谢你，马克维茨医生！ - 使劲玩吧，真可爱
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz! - Break a leg! Sweet kid.

642
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,741
那个斑点有点像巫医病的症状啊
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.

643
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:40,146
什么巫医病？从没听说过有这么搞笑的病
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

644
00:43:40,983 --> 00:43:43,315
- 别问了 - 有人又淘气了
- Don't ask. - Someone's been knotty.

645
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:46,076
放心，一点都不疼
This won't hurt a bit.

646
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:50,588
我们上一个巫医乔，也得了这种病
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.

647
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:54,823
- 然后呢？ - 星期一还在，星期三就挂了
- And? - Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

648
00:43:55,564 --> 00:43:56,895
三天就挂了？
Wednesday, no Joe?

649
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:59,431
终于可以呼吸了，谢了，医生
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

650
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:03,570
这巫医病居然是真的？
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?

651
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:07,433
你会想出办法的，你至少还有48小时能活哪嘛
You'll find a cure. You've got at least 48 hours!

652
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,603
但是我从来没听说过这病啊
But I've never heard of it.

653
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:12,943
这儿连青霉素都没有
I mean... I dont have any penicillin.

654
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:15,449
我怎么都得先照个X光看看怎么回事吧
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!

655
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:18,851
找个狮子帮忙看看里面怎么回事吧 他们肯定乐意的
Have a lion look you over. They'd be happy to.

656
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:30,554
噔噔！
Ta-da!!

657
00:44:30,866 --> 00:44:33,460
- 他真厉害啊 - 真是酷毙啦
- He has talent. - Stupendous and tremendous.

658
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:39,301
这招你们肯定没见过吧，把纽约人都迷翻了
Bet you've never seen that one! Knocked 'em dead in New York!

659
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,366
- 大家试试看吧！ - 好啊好啊！
- Let's all give it a try! - Let's do it!

660
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,110
你们可以尽管试
Well, you can try all you want to,

661
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,205
不过这可是我多年苦练的成果
but it takes years of practice.

662
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:48,307
你得先锻炼你的嘴部肌肉到丰满有力
You'll never get a tight stream

663
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:52,844
然后你才可以把嘴巴撅成这样喷水
until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can

664
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,083
明白了吗？
purse your lips like this. You got it?

665
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:10,064
噔噔！
Ta-da!

666
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:17,140
你们怎么会的？简直一模一样！
How did you? You guys got it right out of the box!

667
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,010
- 你会的 - 我们都会
- If you can do it... ...we can do it.

668
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,309
流淌在我们的血液里
It's in our blood!

669
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,313
我还以为我很特别呢
I always thought I was a bit unique.

670
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:24,579
我们都很特别
We are unique!

671
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:26,651
号称自然原力的就是我们啦
We are like a force of nature!

672
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:29,584
- 光芒万点 - 还有黑色条纹
- A million points of light! - And dark stripes!

673
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:31,853
一模一样！
Exactly the same!

674
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:35,252
一模一样
Exactly the same.

675
00:45:36,665 --> 00:45:40,260
看起来很不错，科瓦斯基 不过这东西能飞起来吗？
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?

676
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:44,095
当然，这里折一下，还有这里那里
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

677
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,264
很好
Nice.

678
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:03,781
伙计们，我爸爸觉得我是个正废材
Oh, man. My dad thinks I'm a total loser.

679
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:05,789
我毁了我父母的生活
I've ruined my parents' lives.

680
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:07,962
这可太不酷啦
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

681
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:12,694
简直太衰了，我得弥补错误
It is lackin' in the crackin', my friend. I've gotta fix this.

682
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:14,128
有些话
So...

683
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:18,629
我想要跟你们说
...there's... There's something I gotta tell you.

684
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:19,796
嗨，伙计们
Hey, guys.

685
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,709
你们又没觉得，这地方真是太赞了？！
Is this place great or what?!

686
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:24,740
我选“没觉得”
I'd go with "or what."

687
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:28,476
听我说，你们肯定不相信，不过…
Well, I'll tell you what. You're not gonna believe it, but...

688
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:31,475
…我跟摩托摩托约会了
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

689
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:33,811
谁是摩托摩托？
Who's Moto Moto?

690
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:37,484
天啊，他又壮又帅又壮！
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

691
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:40,158
- 你知道摩托摩托什么意思吗？ - 双胞胎？
- Know what "Moto Moto" means? - Twins?

692
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:42,159
意思是“超帅超帅”
It means, "Hot Hot."

693
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,456
“超帅超帅”？
"Hot Hot"?

694
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,328
好啊，你什么时候变成非洲通的？
When did you start parlez-ing African?

695
00:46:46,602 --> 00:46:47,591
流淌在我的血液里啦
It's in my blood.

696
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:51,465
别担心，我死了以后 你就可以尽情和帅哥眉来眼去了
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

697
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,407
你有什么毛病，梅尔曼 干嘛在我兴头上泼冷水？
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?

698
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:56,637
我泼冷水的时候，你干嘛要在兴头上？
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?

699
00:46:56,712 --> 00:46:59,408
我的兴头又没在你家门口！
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!

700
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:00,880
别这样，伙计们
Whoa, guys.

701
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,573
没在我家门口就好！
Main Street's mine!

702
00:47:02,651 --> 00:47:04,812
谁稀罕你家门口！
Well, you can have it!

703
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:09,017
你可以和你的超帅先生去…
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

704
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,282
- 你说什么？ - 我们都在说什么呢？
- What are you talking about? - What are we talking about?

705
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:12,858
梅尔曼，你就告诉她吧
Melman, just tell her.

706
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:16,858
要告诉你告诉！什么…告诉她什么？ 你说什么？我听不懂
What? What are you... I don't know what you're talking about.

707
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,498
那我走好了
I guess I'll go, then.

708
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:19,966
随便你
Don't bother.

709
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:23,630
- 你少找我麻烦 - 梅尔曼！格罗丽雅！
- Don't get up on my account. - Melman! Gloria!

710
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:28,040
- 你们不是朋友吗！ - 马蒂说的一点没错
- I thought you guys were friends! - Marty's absolutely right.

711
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,873
- 马蒂？ - 马蒂？
- Marty? - Marty?

712
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:31,103
马蒂？
Marty?

713
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:33,708
这到底怎么回事？
What the heck is going on?

714
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:38,977
你不是？他是…？我觉得他是……你是？
You're not? Oh! He was... I thought he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

715
00:47:39,054 --> 00:47:41,818
你把那家伙…
You thought that guy...

716
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,152
…当成我了？
...was me?

717
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:45,989
不是，哦，是，你们…
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

718
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:48,222
你把我当成他了？
You thought I was him?

719
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:50,555
你们确实长得很…
You guys kind of do look a little...

720
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:53,295
很像啊，的确很像嘛
You look a lot alike. Marty, you look a lot alike.

721
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:57,237
声音一样，笑声一样，连说话方式都一样
You laugh alike. Talk alike. He has the same speech pattern.

722
00:47:57,306 --> 00:48:00,366
很奇怪啦，真的，马蒂
It's a little weird, really. I mean, come on. Marty.

723
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:03,604
所以你是说我其实一点都不特别？
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.

724
00:48:03,812 --> 00:48:05,905
我和其他斑马没两样？
I'm just like any other zebra.

725
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,573
当然不是，你一定很特别嘛！
No. Of course you're different!

726
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,247
哪儿特别？
How?

727
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:13,080
好吧，我分不出
OK, I can't tell you apart.

728
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:16,220
也许你可以考虑带个铃铛什么的
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.

729
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:18,920
- 铃铛？ - 好吧，这是个馊主意
- A bell?! - OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

730
00:48:19,261 --> 00:48:21,923
那我不如穿件T恤 上面写上“我旁边有个笨蛋”？
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?

731
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:24,689
- 我不是笨蛋！ - 不是说你！笨蛋！他才是笨蛋！
- I'm not stupid! - Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

732
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:28,266
你知道嘛，你和马群打成一片的时候
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,

733
00:48:28,504 --> 00:48:31,769
我过着这辈子最倒霉的日子
I've been having the worst day of my life.

734
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:35,440
你总是这么自我中心，是不是？
It's always about you, isn't it?

735
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:39,043
我的麻烦比你的麻烦麻烦多了
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.

736
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:41,947
我是分不清你们俩，那又怎么样？
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

737
00:48:42,618 --> 00:48:45,280
太好了，你就走吧，走吧
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

738
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:48,615
这你最拿手了，和在纽约时一样！
That's what you do best! Just like back in New York!

739
00:48:48,857 --> 00:48:52,122
我在这儿，不过反正你分不出来，是不是？
I'm right here. But you can't tell that, right?

740
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:57,661
你的“真心朋友”希望你一个人
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy

741
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:00,566
好好享受你那“比别人麻烦的多的麻烦”！
your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!

742
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:04,264
好啊，走吧，我才不需要你帮我解决问题！
Good, leave! I don't need you to help me solve my problems!

743
00:49:04,306 --> 00:49:07,469
你们千篇一律，我才认不出谁是马蒂！
You're a dime a dozen! I can't tell which one's Marty!

744
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:10,569
谁是马蒂？等一等，对了，我不在乎！
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute. Oh, yeah, I don't care!

745
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:13,308
帽子好看啊，你这炫耀鬼！
Nice hat, you showoff!

746
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,152
马蒂…
Marty...

747
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:22,646
…别走
...don't go.

748
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:23,359
跟上！跟上！
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

749
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,656
跟上，跟上！

750
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:28,994
看，玛瑞斯！
Look, Maurice!

751
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,563
这里建造我的行宫真是再好不过了！
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

752
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:35,668
找人把这些坑填起来，废料都搬走
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.

753
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:40,003
- 这个头是谁丢的？ - 真浪费
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head? - What a waste.

754
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:43,334
还用你说，我在等死
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

755
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,909
病入膏肓了，知道吗？
I'm terminal, you know?

756
00:49:46,915 --> 00:49:50,442
可能只有一两天好活了
I probably only have another two days left to live.

757
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:52,847
原来是个流浪汉
That's a bummer, man.

758
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:55,850
如果朱利安国王，这是我的名字…
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

759
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:58,352
只有还能活两天
...only had two days left to live,

760
00:49:58,694 --> 00:50:00,127
我会把我想做的事情
I would do all the things

761
00:50:00,195 --> 00:50:02,686
- 统统尝试下 - 哪些事情？
- I've ever dreamed of doing. - Like what?

762
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:05,791
我要成为一个口哨高手
I'd love to become a professional whistler.

763
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:10,134
虽然我现在就很厉害了 不过我还要百尺竿头更进一步
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better,

764
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:12,196
我要吹口哨吹到死
make my living out of it.

765
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:25,816
你知道我还想做什么吗？ 我要侵略邻国
You know what else I would do? I would invade a neighboring country

766
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:29,824
把我的意愿强加给他们 不管他们愿不愿意
and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!

767
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:31,826
对你当然简单了，你是国王嘛
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

768
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,053
没错，你只是个等死的脑袋
Yes. And you are only just a sad little head.

769
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:40,166
不过你死之前，肯定也有想做的事情
There must be something you want to do before you die!

770
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:44,171
- 是有一件事 - 什么事，告诉我
- There is this one thing. - What? Tell me.

771
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,231
- 哦，我不能说 - 什么事？
- No, I couldn't. - What is it?

772
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:49,903
我一直都没勇气告诉格罗丽雅 我对她的感觉
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.

773
00:50:49,978 --> 00:50:51,843
什么事情，告诉我！
What is it? Please tell me!

774
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:55,680
我一直都没勇气告诉格罗丽雅 我对她的感觉
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

775
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,343
我对她多年的感觉
How I've always felt about her.

776
00:50:57,419 --> 00:50:59,250
好吧，别告诉我！
Fine. Don't tell me!

777
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:04,518
是女人的事情吗？我可没听见啊
Is it a woman? You didn't tell me it's a woman.

778
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:08,927
你到底害怕什么？反正你都要死了
What are you afraid of? You're a dead man anyway.

779
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:11,198
是啊，对啊
Yeah. Yeah.

780
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:13,200
你说的对
You're right.

781
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:16,533
你要走到这个女人的面前
You've got to march right up to this woman.

782
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:19,938
看着她的眼睛，身体前倾
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

783
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:22,766
一点点就好，全靠过去也没关系啦
Just a little, or almost all the way.

784
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:27,047
然后你让她也靠过来
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're...

785
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:30,551
直到你们之间只剩一个吻的距离
...just lips' distance away from each other.

786
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:34,282
然后你告诉他，你有多么讨厌她
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

787
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:38,855
其实，是多么爱她
Actually, it's more like love her.

788
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:41,794
哦，你这个小狡猾，大大的狡猾
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

789
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,463
还是个多情种子啊，听好了
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

790
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:48,363
你要站起来，听见了吗？
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

791
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:50,036
- 他没听见 - 我没听见你回答！
- He didn't hear you. - I can't hear you!

792
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:53,140
- 你要站起来！ - 站起来！
- You got to rise up! - Rising up!

793
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:56,701
- 离开这个坑！ - 我站起来了！
- Get out of the hole! - I'm rising out of the ground!

794
00:51:56,979 --> 00:51:58,810
- 他站起来了，玛瑞斯 - 我站起来了，玛瑞斯！
- He's rising, Maurice. - I'm rising, Maurice!

795
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,811
- 站起来！ - 你要为这个女人站起来！
- Rising! - You go right up to this woman!

796
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:03,707
你感觉到了吗？
Do you feel it?

797
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:06,484
- 走到她的面前 - 告诉她真相！
- Go up to her face! - Tell the truth!

798
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:11,725
- 我要告诉她！ - 然后告诉她，“宝贝，我爱死你了”
- I'm going to tell her! - Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

799
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:14,986
耶！我要告诉她！我要告诉她！
Yeah! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it!

800
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,594
我喜欢这个快乐的脑袋
I love that happy little head.

我想知道，如果我要留下来
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here...

814

我想问你…

815
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:07,545
让你的甜蜜小嘴 在我的耳边轻吟低语吧
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.

那么，你到底觉得我哪里好？
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?

820

你是我见过的最丰满的女孩

821
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:26,333
好吧，还有呢
OK. Other than that.

822
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:28,062
我想想
Let's see.

823
00:53:28,136 --> 00:53:31,128
哦，你很壮实
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

Right.

天啊，你真高大
My gosh, girl, you huge.

00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,002
你说过了
You said that.

哦，对哦
Yeah, that's right.

828
00:53:42,084 --> 00:53:43,915
还是无声胜有声吧
We don't have to talk no more.

829
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:45,346
格罗丽雅！

835
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:05,663
我接受你的道歉了
Apology accepted.

836

好吧，那就这样吧，那我就…
OK. Well, that's it, then.

838
00:54:13,982 --> 00:54:17,110
对了，我们忙着呢
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

839
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:19,943
不，不是这样的
No. No, that's not it.

840
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:24,448
听着，摩托托，你最好对这女孩好一点
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.

841
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,293
因为你找到了这个世界上最完美的女人
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.

842
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,055
如果我有这么幸运的话
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,

843
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:34,899
我一定每天给她送花 当然不是随便什么野花都行，知道吗？
I'd give her flowers every day. And notjust any flowers. OK?

844
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:38,906
她喜欢兰花，白色的那种 早餐要送到她床上
Her favorites are orchids. White. And breakfast in bed.

845
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:41,340
六片小麦土司 两面都要涂黄油
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.

846
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,071
面包片要去掉，她不喜欢吃
No crust, the way she likes it.

847
00:54:43,311 --> 00:54:46,644
我愿意成为她最知心的朋友 在她伤心难过的时候给她依靠的肩膀
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.

848
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:50,409
我每天都会想着怎么让她开心
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.

849
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:54,148
她有这世界上最美的笑脸
She has the most amazing laugh.

850
00:54:57,492 --> 00:55:00,484
如果我是你，我就会这么做
That's what I would do if I were you.

851
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:03,161
不过我不是，所以你要替我做了
But I'm not, so you do it.

852
00:55:04,499 --> 00:55:06,160
好吧
OK.

853
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:08,500
说什么呢？
What?

854
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:12,004
太感人了
That was beautiful.

855
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:15,507
对了，我们说到哪了？
Anyways, where were we?

856
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:17,342
我很“壮实”？
I'm "huge"?

857
00:55:19,181 --> 00:55:20,808
吓到你了吧，马库加？
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

858
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:24,113
我们来了结恩怨吧，像真正的雄狮那样
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!

859
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:28,520
这拳吃的爽不爽？再吃一记 这是你陷害我的报应
Is this real enough for you? How about this? This is for setting me up!

860
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,583
这拳是因为你抢了我爸爸的工作 这拳是因为你羞辱了我全家
This is for stealing my dad's job! This is for humiliating my family!

861
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:35,129
让我看起来像个笨蛋！
And making me look like a fool!

862
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:54,876
满意了？你们就飞走吧
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

863
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:56,548
懦夫
Coward.

864
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:10,061
水塘干了
The water. It's gone.

865
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:12,229
水塘以前从来没干涸过啊
It's never gone dry before.

866
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,167
- 这下大家都要等死了 - 这是怎么回事？
- We'll need a lot more dying holes. - How could this happen?

867
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:18,502
让开！这是怎么了？
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

868
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:21,440
水塘干了，水不够喝了
The watering hole is dry! There's barely water for one of us!

869
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,842
- 观察的很仔细嘛，雪莉 - 我叫鲍勃
- Good observation, Shirley. - I'm Bobby.

870
00:56:23,912 --> 00:56:25,402
马库加，我们该怎么办？
Makunga, what do we do?

871
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,970
安静！
Quiet!

872
00:56:27,415 --> 00:56:32,409
听着，要解决危机，我们只有一个办法：
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:

873
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:35,150
大家来抢好了
We'll all have to fight for it.

874
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:37,748
- 抢？怎么能这样？ - 太离谱了
- We can't fight for it. - That's crazy.

875
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:40,751
太不公平了，你肯定赢嘛
That's not fair. You'd win!

876
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:42,260
就是这意思，雪莉
Exactly, Shirley.

877
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,419
我叫鲍勃…
I'm Bob...

878
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:47,332
不好意思，各位，生活本来就不公平 现在我话事
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair. I'm in charge now,

879
00:56:47,602 --> 00:56:50,594
多亏了阿拉凯，那位舞林大狮啊
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

880
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:54,399
拜托了，马库加，这是保护区里唯一的水源啊
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.

881
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:58,435
如果你渴了，你就得去保护区外找水源了
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.

882
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,044
- 保护区外面？ - 太危险了！
- Off the reserve? - It's too dangerous!

883
00:57:01,149 --> 00:57:02,582
盗猎者会把我们都杀掉的
Hunters would shoot us!

884
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:04,551
从来没有人离开保护区还活着回来的
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

885
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,450
我离开过！
I left the reserve!

886
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:08,616
我不是还活着？！
And survived.

887
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:11,892
我有个想法
I can do something about this.

888
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,294
这就和水管堵塞差不多，纽约经常有这事 只要我们往上游走…
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

889
00:57:16,364 --> 00:57:18,491
- 上游？ - 离开保护区？
- Upriver? - Off the reserve?

890
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:19,693
就凭你？
You?

891
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:23,763
没错，我会把水道疏通让水源恢复的
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.

892
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:28,970
太好了，我可以帮你整理行李 不过看你戴帽子的衰样，我就知道你已经准备好了
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

893
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:34,642
好啊，你就笑吧，最好把你的毛都笑秃 我会证明你错了
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

894
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,810
也许你可以跳个舞求求雨什么的
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.

895
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:45,056
祖巴一定知道怎么做的
Zuba would know what to do.

896
00:57:45,327 --> 00:57:47,158
- 祖巴在哪里？ - 你根本不在乎大家的死活
- Where's Zuba? - You don't care about us.

897
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:49,488
祖巴应该当领导，不是你
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

898
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:55,727
好吧，好吧！
All right, fine!

899
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:59,496
为了谨慎起见 我会向祖巴咨询的！
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!

900
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:07,345
马蒂？
Marty?

901
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:18,189
马蒂？
Hey! Marty!

902
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:24,521
马蒂？
Marty?

903
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:28,961
马蒂
Marty.

904
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:30,696
他的水果帽哪儿来的？
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

905
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,200
不好意思，不好意思！
Excuse me! Excuse me!

906
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:36,533
马蒂在吗？
Hi. Is Marty in there?

907
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:39,373
有人看见马蒂了吗？
Anyone seen Marty?

908
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,550
马蒂在哪？
Which one of us is Marty?

909
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:46,714
好吧，如果你们看见他
All right. Well, if you see him,

910
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:49,222
请告诉他 他的朋友阿历克斯来跟他告别
tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.

911
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,055
告别？别走嘛，你要去哪啊？
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

912
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:55,494
- 我们可以去吗？ - 不行，这是我一个人的事情
- Can we come? - No. I have to do this alone.

913
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:57,724
你不能出保护区！
You can't leave the reserve!

914
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:10,475
你在干什么呀？
What are you doing?

915
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:12,906
- 他们会连你帽子都抢的 - 盗猎者到处都是
- They'll get your hat. - Hunters are everywhere!

916
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:15,405
你要去把帽子留下好不好
Could you leave the hat?

917
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:17,144
马蒂！我知道你在里面
Marty! I know you're in there.

918
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:21,245
离开之前，我有些话想对你说
Before I go, I got something I want to say.

919
00:59:22,257 --> 00:59:24,521
你一直都是个好朋友
You've been a great friend.

920
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:28,084
你总是帮我找到问题的积极面
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems

921
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:30,028
我却从来没有想过你也有自己的烦恼
that I never think of you having any.

922
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:33,924
在你需要我的时候 我没有在你身边支持你
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.

923
00:59:34,436 --> 00:59:36,267
就像在动物园时一样
Just like back at the zoo.

924
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:41,438
我这算哪门子的朋友？ 真是逊毙了
What kind of friend does that make me? A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

925
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:43,938
我只是想让你知道…
I just want you to know that I...

926
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:46,777
你是我的真心朋友
You're one in a million.

927
00:59:47,282 --> 00:59:49,113
太感人了
This is touching.

928
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,617
真是太感人了
It is touching.

929
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:54,444
你能转过身来，让我当面告诉你吗？
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?

930
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:57,114
找到你了！
That's right. Gotcha!

931
00:59:57,459 --> 01:00:00,053
我看到你了，没错，就是你
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

932
01:00:00,128 --> 01:00:02,062
没错，就是你
You, right there.

933
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:06,396
第二十排左数第二百零三个
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.

934
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:07,867
找到你了，马蒂
That's you, Marty.

935
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:09,964
知道是你
I know it's you.

936
01:00:11,806 --> 01:00:13,865
你知道你特别在哪吗？
Know what makes you special?

937
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:18,646
他们都是白黑相间的 而你是黑白相间的
These guys are white with black stripes. You're black with white stripes.

938
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,541
你是个天生的梦想家，马蒂
You're a dreamer, Marty.

939
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:24,478
一直都是，而且你对音乐很有品味
Always have been. You have great taste in music

940
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:27,151
交朋友却逊得很
and horrible taste in friends.

941
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:30,652
我不是说梅尔曼和格罗丽雅 我说的是我自己
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

942
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:34,427
好吧，我跟你去
OK, I'm in.

943
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:36,828
马蒂，你不能去
Marty, you can't come with me.

944
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:38,661
这不是你说了算的
You don't have a choice.

945
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:46,167
- 那边有人类！ - 你们真是疯了，回来啊！
- People are out there! - You're crazy! Come back!

946
01:00:46,508 --> 01:00:48,169
他们会抓住你们的
The people will get you!

947
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,569
帽子可别丢了啊
Don't lose the hat!

948
01:00:51,446 --> 01:00:52,777
帽子，永别了
Bye, hat!

949
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:57,443
有水吗？
Any water?

950
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:01,186
没有，还是金子和钻石
No, just more diamonds and gold.

951
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:07,860
大家别放弃希望
Don't give up hope.

952
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:10,830
大家听着！我来拯救你们了！
Listen up! I will help you!

953
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:14,027
想要水回来，出路只有一条
There's only one way to get your precious water.

954
01:01:14,602 --> 01:01:17,366
我，你们敬爱的国王朱利安
I, your beloved King Julien

955
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:22,536
只要给我的好朋友水神们送点祭品就有水了
must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods,

956
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:25,710
他们就住在火山里！
in the volcano!

957
01:01:29,217 --> 01:01:30,377
这有什么用？
What does that do?

958
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:33,280
有什么用？问得好
What does that do? Excellent question.

959
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:36,649
只要把我的祭品送进火山口
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

960
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:40,717
我的好朋友水神享用了祭品之后
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

961
01:01:41,062 --> 01:01:43,223
“很好吃，谢谢你的祭品啊”
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

962
01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:46,165
“多吃点嘛” “不，我已经吃饱了”
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."

963
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:48,600
“你不多吃点就太见外了”
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."

964
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,104
“我已经吃饱了”
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

965
01:01:51,172 --> 01:01:54,232
“你看看你，瘦成这样” “我说我已经吃饱了，你聋了吗？！”
"Look at you! You're skinny!" "No! I've had enough!"

966
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:59,838
水神们享用了祭品了之后非常开心
The gods eat the sacrifice. They are grateful.

967
01:01:59,948 --> 01:02:03,782
他们会给我水 我再把水给你们就好了
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.

968
01:02:03,818 --> 01:02:05,080
什么？
What?

969
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,646
有用吗？
Does it work?

970
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:09,420
当然没！我是说，当然有啦
No! I mean, yes.

971
01:02:09,924 --> 01:02:11,414
你说呢，莫里斯？
Well, Maurice?

972
01:02:11,759 --> 01:02:14,091
呃，一半一半吧
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

973
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:16,927
我们同意！
We'll do it!

974
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:19,263
太好了！
Excellent!

975
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:23,802
现在我需要有人到火山口里去
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano

976
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:25,863
当水神们的祭品
and get eaten by gods.

977
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:29,168
有人愿意去吗？举手啊
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

978
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:32,771
好吧，这里有没有还没找到过真爱…
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love,

979
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:38,017
面对死亡无所畏惧的真心英雄？
who could look death straight in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

980
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:40,111
- 我来当祭品吧！ - 梅尔曼？
- I'll do it. - Melman?

981
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:53,294
赶紧走，等大家都恢复理智可就不好
Hurry up! Before we all come to our senses!

982
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,360
梅尔曼，你怎么了？
Melman, what is wrong with you?

983
01:02:56,638 --> 01:03:01,302
反正我也还是将死之鹿了 如果我的死能求来水，我死也瞑目了
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.

984
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:03,406
你脑子秀逗了吗？
Are you nuts?

985
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:06,174
我只是想你知道，在动物园的时候…
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

986
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:09,580
让我能活下去的不是医生的处方
it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.

987
01:03:09,817 --> 01:03:11,910
从来都只因为你
It was always you.

988
01:03:11,986 --> 01:03:14,420
只要每天都能看到你
Seeing you every day.

989
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:16,650
我就有活下去的勇气
That's what kept me going.

990
01:03:20,328 --> 01:03:22,319
梅尔曼，等等！
Melman! Wait!

991
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:28,062
梅尔曼！梅尔曼！梅尔曼！
Melman! Melman! Melman!

992
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:33,329
你打算就这么一直生闷气吗？
You going to mope like this all day?

993
01:03:34,175 --> 01:03:35,665
别和我哼哼
Don't "hmph" me.

994
01:03:35,944 --> 01:03:39,607
-听着，祖巴，这是个奇迹
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

995
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:44,550
我们的孩子回到我们身边了 你还不满意吗？
Our son came back to us. How come that is not good enough for you?

996
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,746
你说什么呢，雌性！
What are you saying, woman?

997
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:51,853
我们曾失去过他一次，祖巴 我们不能再失去他了
We lost him once, Zuba. Let's not lose him again.

998
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:02,533
祖巴！
Zuba!

999
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,199
- 祖巴！ - 滚开！
- Zuba! - Get out of here!

1000
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,101
你有何贵干？
What do you want?

1001
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:08,369
出事了
It's awful.

1002
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,772
水塘干了
The watering hole is dried up.

1003
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:13,780
干了？不可能
Dried up? That's impossible!

1004
01:04:13,848 --> 01:04:15,713
一滴都没剩！
There's nothing left!

1005
01:04:15,783 --> 01:04:19,549
你是狮王，马库加 你有什么办法？
You're alpha lion, Makunga. What are you gonna do about it?

1006
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:23,853
你的儿子，阿拉凯，他说他能解决 他往上游去了
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1007
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:25,517
-他出了保护区了？ - 不会吧！
- Off the reserve?! - No!

1008
01:04:25,593 --> 01:04:28,323
我曾想阻止他 我跟他说这纯粹是自杀
I tried to stop him. I told him it was suicide.

1009
01:04:28,396 --> 01:04:30,660
但是他一心想要证明自己给你看
He was determined to prove himself to you.

1010
01:04:31,899 --> 01:04:34,800
你留在这，以防万一他回来
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1011
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:39,066
快去啊，祖巴！
Hurry, Zuba!

1012
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:44,004
我喉咙太干了
I'm so parched.

1013
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:52,747
这地方是不是越来越毛骨悚然了？
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1014
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:57,348
我们分头走，找到问题所在 猎人们不会发现我们的
We'll slip in, find the problem. Hunters will never know we were here.

1015
01:04:57,425 --> 01:04:59,154
为什么这事只有我们做？
Why are we doing this?

1016
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:02,760
这样我爸爸会觉得我…
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1017
01:05:03,264 --> 01:05:05,630
我想让他知道我是只真正的雄狮
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

1018
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,863
那你现在是什么？巧克力狮子？
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1019
01:05:08,936 --> 01:05:14,374
我知道这听起来难以置信 不过真正的狮子貌似是不跳舞的
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.

1020
01:05:14,442 --> 01:05:15,602
什么？！
What?!

1021
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:18,376
至少我爸爸是这么想的
As far as my dad is concerned.

1022
01:05:18,446 --> 01:05:21,040
可你是个明星啊，至少人们是这么想的
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.

1023
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:24,445
那是在纽约，这是在非洲 标准不一样
In New York. This is Africa... much tougher crowd.

1024
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:26,510
马蒂，就是这里了！
Marty, this is it!

1025
01:05:27,622 --> 01:05:30,113
就是这里堵塞了
This is the clog! Come on.

1026
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:39,292
水都在这啊
Well, there's the water.

1027
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:43,960
注意隐蔽，看那边
Stay down. Look at that.

1028
01:05:44,305 --> 01:05:46,637
一针正针，两针反针
Knit one, purl two.

1029
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:47,800
是她
It's her.

1030
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:49,570
- 这样对吗？ - 织的很好
- Is this right? - Very good.

1031
01:05:49,644 --> 01:05:51,578
奶奶，你慢点
Nana, slow down.

1032
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:54,410
你这都织成麻袋了
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1033
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:56,814
别扯，让我来吧
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1034
01:05:57,752 --> 01:05:59,219
我们需要炸药，你有吗？
We need dynamite. Got any?

1035
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:03,480
哦，糟了，我今天早上刚用完！
Oh, snap! I just used my last stick this morning!

1036
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,489
- 野蛮人啊！ - 快执行躲避战术！
- Savages! - Evasive maneuvers!

1037
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:10,128
- 蛇形躲避，用蛇形！ - 乌贼型躲避
- Serpentine, serpentine! - Squiggly squid maneuver!

1038
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:12,996
锯齿形，锯齿形躲避！
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1039
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:15,666
不对，不对，用乌贼型！
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1040
01:06:16,003 --> 01:06:17,095
残影躲避
Etch A Sketch!

1041
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:20,330
太复杂啦！章鱼型，章鱼型躲避！
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1042
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,843
- 快跑，马蒂！ - 我不能把你一人丢下！
- Run, Marty! - I can't leave you here!

1043
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:29,914
去找人帮忙！用乌贼型躲避！ 快点去！用乌贼型躲避！
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver! Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1044
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:33,119
残影躲避！残影躲避！
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1045
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:37,449
<i>拯救我们！ 我们爱你！
Save us We love you</i>

1046
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:38,856
没问题
OK.

1047
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:41,855
没问题，不怕
OK, OK, OK.

1048
01:06:48,803 --> 01:06:50,566
<i>- 拯救我们 - 梅尔曼
- Save us - Melman</i>

1049
01:06:50,638 --> 01:06:52,367
<i>- 我们爱你 - 梅尔曼
- We love you - Melman</i>

1050
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,429
<i>拯救我们
Save us</i>

1051
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:55,942
没问题，跳下去就可以，不怕不怕
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1052
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:58,001
<i>- 梅尔曼 - 我们爱你
- Melman - We love you</i>

1053
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,637
<i>- 梅尔曼 - 拯救我们
- Melman - Save us</i>

1054
01:06:59,747 --> 01:07:02,409
我来了，我来了
Here we go! Here we go!

1055
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:05,483
- 怎么这么热闹？ - 乔？
- What's all the hoopla about? - Joe?

1056
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,211
巫医乔？我们以为你早死了！
Joe the Witch Doctor? We thought you were dead!

1057
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:11,947
我也以为我已经死了 后来发现原来我全身都是斑点啊
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.

1058
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:15,059
那么梅尔曼也没得绝症啊！
So Melman's not dying!

1059
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:18,225
- 梅尔曼没得绝症？ - 天啊，不会吧！
- Melman's not dying! - Oh, no!

1060
01:07:18,566 --> 01:07:19,555
梅尔曼！
Melman!

1061
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:21,165
让开！
Move!

1062
01:07:21,402 --> 01:07:25,168
别跳啊，梅尔曼，别跳，别犯傻！
Don't do this! Julien, stop this! This is crazy!

1063
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:30,108
现在丢长颈鹿到火山里去求雨算是犯傻啦？
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1064
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:31,167
就是！
Yes!

1065
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:37,707
- 拜托，梅尔曼，别跳啊！ - 格罗丽雅？
- Please, Melman! Stop! - Gloria?

1066
01:07:37,785 --> 01:07:39,844
- 你不能跳下去！ - 为什么？
- You can't do this! - Why not?

1067
01:07:40,087 --> 01:07:41,418
因为…
Because...

1068
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:02,336
你就是不能跳，梅尔曼
You can't do this, Melman.

1069
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,271
首先，我的心都碎了
First, that hurts.

1070
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:07,673
其次，反正我只有18个小时可活了
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.

1071
01:08:07,748 --> 01:08:10,273
梅尔曼，一定要问清楚…
Melman, I gotta know...

1072
01:08:11,452 --> 01:08:13,943
你跟我说的那些话，都是真心的吗？
...did you mean those things you said about me?

1073
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:16,355
当然是真心的
Of course I did.

1074
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:18,784
- 太离谱了 - 离谱吗？
- That's crazy. - It is?

1075
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:25,455
真正离谱的是 我居然只有在到了世界的尽头的时候…
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world...

1076
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:28,797
…才发现真爱其实…
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1077
01:08:29,136 --> 01:08:30,797
一直在我身旁
lived right next door.

1078
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:34,138
看来剩下的18个小时
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1079
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,037
我可以没有遗憾了
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1080
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:39,472
时间再短暂 真爱永流传
I'll take whatever you got.

1081
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:47,083
- 玛瑞斯，怎么回事？ - 胖妞找到真爱了
- Maurice, what happened? - I believe the fat lady has sung.

1082
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:49,987
- 这儿怎么回事？ - 马蒂？
- What's going on here? - Marty!

1083
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:53,989
阿历克斯有麻烦了！ 我们快去上游救他！
Alex is in big trouble! We got to get upriver fast!

1084
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:56,492
- 坐飞机去怎么样？ - 太好了，走吧！
- What about the plane? - Perfect! Come on!

1085
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:03,067
不满足我们的条件，大家就不开工
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.

1086
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:04,832
怎么样，给不给产假？
Now, maternity leave.

1087
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:08,398
产假？你们都是爷们啊
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1088
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:10,967
我们要用飞机执行营救任务
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1089
01:09:11,045 --> 01:09:13,980
工会没解体之前你们别想了
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.

1090
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:17,415
如果还不把飞机修好，我就让你们都解体！
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.

1091
01:09:17,485 --> 01:09:21,819
你没看见这些民工正罢工呢吗？ 没有产假！
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1092
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:29,386
也许有人不希望这些照片流传出去吧
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.

1093
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:41,168
好吧，给你们产假
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1094
01:09:42,577 --> 01:09:43,908
总算好了
Finally.

1095
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:51,848
你们带我去哪？ 你们要干什么？
Where we headed? What's going on? Where are we going?

1096
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:55,582
别这样，拜托了，别把我架在上面
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1097
01:09:55,923 --> 01:09:57,584
你们搞错了
This is wrong.

1098
01:09:57,658 --> 01:10:01,219
看见没，你们都是“幸存者” （美国知名真人秀节目）
You see? You are survivors.

1099
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:05,095
现在，尝尝烤狮子怎么样？
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1100
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:07,057
我们不能吃狮子
You can't eat a lion.

1101
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:09,068
别担心，尝起来和鸡肉差不多
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1102
01:10:09,136 --> 01:10:11,434
不要啊，别听她的
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1103
01:10:12,273 --> 01:10:14,434
她已经疯了，你们清醒点
She's out of her mind, people!

1104
01:10:16,577 --> 01:10:18,272
我也是纽约来的啊！
I'm from New York City!

1105
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:21,014
是我啊，我是中央公园的阿历克斯啊！
It's me, Alex the lion! From Central Park!

1106
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:29,612
爸爸！
Dad!

1107
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:34,790
你脑袋被大象踩了么？ 跑这儿来干嘛？
What were you thinking, son? You got no business being out here!

1108
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:38,628
你躲在我后面
Stay behind me.

1109
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:41,896
他们只是纽约人，有点粗鲁受了惊吓而已
They're New Yorkers. They're just rude and frightened people.

1110
01:10:42,136 --> 01:10:43,467
躲在后面！
Stay back!

1111
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,795
你们还想不想吃晚饭了？
You'd let your dinner get away?

1112
01:10:52,146 --> 01:10:55,479
- 你搞什么？儿子 - 看我的
- What are you doing? - The only thing I know how to do.

1113
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,709
搞什么鬼？
What the heck?

1114
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:08,158
嗨，这些动作真眼熟
Hey, I know those moves.

1115
01:11:08,596 --> 01:11:09,654
是阿历克斯？
Alex?

1116
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,397
- 是狮子阿历克斯啊！ - 中央公园的那只！
- It's Alex the lion! - From Central Park!

1117
01:11:15,736 --> 01:11:17,101
真的是阿历克斯！
It is Alex!

1118
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:19,833
世界上只有一只狮子舞跳的这么好！
Only one lion can move like that!

1119
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:26,510
真帅啊！
He's beautiful.

1120
01:11:26,747 --> 01:11:27,736
简直难以置信
I can't believe it.

1121
01:11:34,522 --> 01:11:36,683
他怎么做到的？
How does he do that?

1122
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:50,762
你干什么？
What are you doing?

1123
01:11:51,038 --> 01:11:53,700
我和儿子一起跳舞啊，我想是
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1124
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,531
不要想，爸爸，要感觉！
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1125
01:11:56,544 --> 01:11:58,205
蝴蝶穿花！
Butterfly!

1126
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:02,712
我感觉到了！我感觉到了！
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1127
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,553
嗷！
Roar!

1128
01:12:26,574 --> 01:12:29,566
跳的真不错，现在该吃饭了！
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1129
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,138
爸爸，当心！
Dad, look out!

1130
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:34,407
这是…
What the...

1131
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:36,240
阿历克斯！快上去！
Alex! Get in!

1132
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:40,079
她手里有枪，快走啊！
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1133
01:12:40,354 --> 01:12:41,946
- 什么？ - 她手里有枪！
- What? - She's got a gun!

1134
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:44,421
快走！传话过去！
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1135
01:12:48,095 --> 01:12:52,589
他说炸掉大坝让大家开心一下吧！
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1136
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,927
机长，阿历克斯说要炸掉水坝
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1137
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,502
没问题，他就来当炸弹吧！
All right! But it's his funeral.

1138
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:02,440
- 飞向水坝！ - 明白，机长！
- Hard to port! - Aye-aye, Skippy!

1139
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:05,268
加油！加油啊！
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1140
01:13:11,619 --> 01:13:13,951
回来！那是我的晚饭！
Come back! That's my dinner!

1141
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:15,849
科瓦斯基，全速前进
Kowalski, full throttle.

1142
01:13:18,459 --> 01:13:19,448
音乐！
Music!

1143
01:13:20,528 --> 01:13:23,053
- 我喜欢这首歌 - 经典就是经典
- I like this song. - It never gets old.

1144
01:13:23,297 --> 01:13:27,199
的确琅琅上口嘛 注意！降低高度！
It does have a catchy hook. Come about! Bring her in low!

1145
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:31,460
各位抓紧扶稳，我们去搞垮水坝！
Hold onto your skirts! It's dam-busting time!

1146
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,803
抓紧啦，我们来啦！
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1147
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:39,639
告诉他们别这样！升上去！不然我们会死的！
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1148
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,872
肯定有别的办法的！传话过去！
There's got to be another way! Pass it on!

1149
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:50,318
他们说别爬升，让我们死吧，这是唯一的办法了
They say no pull up. Kill us. There's no other way. Basset hound.

1150
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:51,889
你没搞错吗？
Are you sure?

1151
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:56,653
真是舍生取义啊
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.

1152
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:58,328
这不是真的！医务兵！
No! Medic!

1153
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,163
加速！
Ramming speed!

1154
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:10,001
来吧！
Bring it on!

1155
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:14,177
讨厌的小猫
Bad kitties.

1156
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:24,848
我不知道祭品怎么没效果
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.

1157
01:14:25,192 --> 01:14:27,524
理论没错啊
The science seemed so solid.

1158
01:14:27,928 --> 01:14:32,695
如果我不是口哨吹的太好的话 我自己就去当祭品了
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1159
01:14:42,376 --> 01:14:44,367
是您！我找到您了！
It's you! I found you!

1160
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:45,601
莫特？
Mort?

1161
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:50,043
大坏鱼！
Bad fishy!

1162
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,960
水神不知道喜不喜欢海鲜
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1163
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:03,888
拭目以待吧
Let's find out.

1164
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:06,730
看啊 ，玛瑞斯
Look, Maurice.

1165
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:10,898
- 真灵验啊 - 我成功了
- That was quick. - I did it!

1166
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:13,729
我成功！我成功了！
I did it! I did it!

1167
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:16,064
是啊，你立功了！
OK, you did it!

1168
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,073
噢！太好了！
Oh, yes!!

1169
01:15:44,204 --> 01:15:45,193
看啊！
Look!

1170
01:15:45,773 --> 01:15:47,604
- 是阿拉凯！ - 是祖巴！
- It's Alakay! - It's Zuba!

1171

你们成功了！
You did it!

1172
01:15:50,611 --> 01:15:52,602
阿拉凯，祖巴，你们成功了！
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1173
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:00,944
祖巴！阿拉凯！
Zuba! Alakay!

1174
01:16:01,555 --> 01:16:02,544
你们回来了！
You're back!

1175
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:06,349
你们没事我真是太高兴了
I'm so glad you're safe!

1176
01:16:07,294 --> 01:16:08,955
让开
Out of my way.

1177
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,962
好吧，好吧
Well, well, well.

1178
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:17,461
如果我没记错的话，你不当狮王了
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.

1179
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:19,636
而你，被逐出狮群了
And you were kicked out.

1180
01:16:19,907 --> 01:16:23,638
所以别指望你们能咸鱼翻身
So don't think that this changes anything.

1181
01:16:23,911 --> 01:16:28,712
没错，您是大王，我们还专门给您带回来了礼物
You're right. In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.

1182
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:31,247
一个雄狮味十足的包包 这在纽约可是很流行的
A man bag. Very popular where Im from.

1183
01:16:31,318 --> 01:16:33,684
- 我真不知道说什么好 - 您带了可以尽显雄风，还能装东西
- Don't know what to say. - Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1184
01:16:33,754 --> 01:16:38,919
这背带可调的？真不错 我散步时挎着可真是太时髦了
Does the strap adjust? This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1185
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:41,150
不过你们还是要被流放
But you're still banished.

1186
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:43,158
我们知道你会这么说
We figured you'd say that.

1187
01:16:45,332 --> 01:16:47,493
我的包包！
My handbag!

1188
01:16:48,268 --> 01:16:49,735
你这讨厌的小猫！
You bad kitty!

1189

不要啊！不要啊！
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1190

你证明了自己，儿子

谢谢，老爸，不过这该是你的
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1193
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:21,357
不，儿子，是我们的！
No, son. To us!

1194
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,704
我的儿子！纽约之王！
My son! The King of New York!

1195
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:34,370
我的好孩子！
That's my baby!

1196
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:44,714
真爱超越一切界限
Love transcends all differences.

1197
01:17:45,392 --> 01:17:49,726
今天我们在这里欢聚 见证这样的爱情
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.

1198
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:53,897
不管人生起落，你们是否都会终生厮守？
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?

1199
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:58,665
还是“起”吧
For better, please.

1200
01:18:00,074 --> 01:18:02,565
你们这对真是…好奇怪啊
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1201
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,741
不会长久的
That's not going to last.

1202
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:07,813
我可以亲下新娘吗？
Can I kiss the bride?

1203
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:09,740
当然不行！音乐！
No! Music!

1204
01:18:10,484 --> 01:18:11,576
- 支架！ - 检查完毕！
- Struts. - Check.

1205
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:12,908

在蒙特卡洛度完蜜月后，我们会回来的
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo,

1210
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,261
也许是金子花光的时候
or whenever the gold runs out.

1211
01:18:25,499 --> 01:18:26,693
早点回来！
Come back soon!

1212
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:31,862
妈妈，让他们多玩会吧 反正纽约又不会跑，是不是，伙计们？
Mom, let them take their time. New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1213
01:18:31,939 --> 01:18:33,964
说的没错！
You're right about that!

1214
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,975
只要我能和她在一起…
As long as I'm with her...

1215
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:39,843
…在哪都是天堂
...and you two, I don't care where we are.

1216

她笑起来真美
She has the most amazing laugh.

1217

爱果然是没界限啊！
Love has no boundaries!

1218
01:18:48,722 --> 01:18:51,054
看来你得忍受我们一段时间了
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.

1219
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,562
爸爸？怎么了？
Dad? What's wrong?

1220
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:59,292
我只是觉得我们可以…
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...

1221
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:03,862
- 你骗到我了！ - 我骗到你了，儿子！
- You got me! - I got you, son!

1222
01:19:04,138 --> 01:19:07,539
我的招数都被你学去了
You got me with my thing. You brought it back around on me.

1223
01:19:10,477 --> 01:19:12,138
我骗到你了！
I got you, son!

1224
01:19:12,746 --> 01:19:15,078
老爹还不赖吧，是不是，马蒂？
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1225
01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:17,583
- 马蒂？谁是马蒂？ - 少来了
- Marty? Who's Marty? - Come on.

01:19:17,651 --> 01:19:20,916
- 我不知道谁是马蒂 - 你骗不了我
- I don't know no Marty. - You can't fool me.

1227
01:19:20,988 --> 01:19:23,183
这儿没马蒂啊
Ain't no Marty here.

1228
01:19:23,257 --> 01:19:27,694
马蒂！我看你眼睛就知道是你啦
Marty! I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.

1229
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:31,026
<i>我一直在流浪 永远在流浪
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever</i>

1230
01:19:31,098 --> 01:19:34,363
<i>现在找到一个家 像是在天堂徜徉
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven</i>

1231
01:19:34,434 --> 01:19:37,699
<i>我一直在流浪 永远在流浪
