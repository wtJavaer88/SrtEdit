1
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,386
根据目前所有已知的飞行定律
According to all known laws of aviation,

2
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,190
蜜蜂是不可能飞起来的
there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

3
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:34,962
它们的翅膀小得根本无法 让胖乎乎的身体离开地面
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

4
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,468
当然，蜜蜂终究还是飞起来了
The bee, of course, flies anyway

5
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,701
因为它们根本不在意那些 在人类看来不可能的事情
because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

6
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:02,160
黄配黑、黄配黑、黄配黑、黄配黑
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,356
哇噢，黑配黄的！换换口味吧
Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.

8
00:00:02,357 --> 00:00:10,500



9
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:19,077
巴里！吃早饭啦
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

10
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,476
来啦！
Coming!

11
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,141
等下
Hang on a second.

12
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,172
喂？
Hello?

13
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,343
- 巴里？ - 亚当？
- Barry? - Adam?

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,980
- 你相信这一刻真的就要到来了么？ - 我也觉得难以置信，待会儿去接你
- Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.

15
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,323
“锐”气逼人哈
Looking sharp.

16
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,094
巴里，你怎么不走楼梯呢？ 你爸为了装这个，可是花了好多钱
Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.

17
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,532
对不起，我太激动了
Sorry. I'm excited.

18
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,594
大学毕业生在这儿呢，乖儿子 我们都为你骄傲
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.

19
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,105
完美的成绩单，所有都是B
A perfect report card, all B's.

20
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,436
真让人感到骄傲
Very proud.

21
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,373
老妈！我做了发型
Ma! I got a thing going here.

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,106
- 你毛上有点儿东西 - 噢，那是有意做的！
- You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!

23
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,616
- 记得向我们招手！我们在第11万8千排 - 走了！
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!

24
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:00,243
巴里，别在屋子里飞！
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
片名：《蜜蜂电影》

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,000
（报纸名为《今日蜂房》，头条为“飞盘击中蜂房”）

27
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,971
- 早啊，亚当 - 早，巴里
- Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.

28
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,444
- 你搽了发胶吗？ - 用了一点，特别的日子嘛，终于毕业了
- Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.

29
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:28,912
我从未想过我还能熬到毕业
Never thought I'd make it.

30
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,472
是啊，3天小学，3天中学
Three days grade school, three days high school.

31
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,744
那些日子真难熬
Those were awkward.

32
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,982
3天大学，我真庆幸我抽了一天时间 搭便车在蜂房里逛了一下
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

33
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,819
你回来之后，的确不同了
You did come back different.

34
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,555
- 早，巴里 - 亚蒂 ，留胡子啦？挺帅的
- Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

35
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,259
- 你听说弗兰基的事了吗？ - 听说了
- Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,198
- 你打算出席他的葬礼吗？ - 没，我才不去呢
- You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.

37
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,462
大家都知道叮了人就得死
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.

38
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,130
我才不会为了一只松鼠去送死 他做事真是不走脑子
Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.

39
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:55,730
我想他只是一时冲动罢了
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.

40
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,878
我爱死这个多功能游乐园了 每天出了门就可以玩
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.

41
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:09,216
这就是为什么他们说我们不用休息
That's why we don't need vacations.

42
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:19,191
这么一看…真是壮观啊
Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.

43
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,132
- 亚当，今天我们长大成人了 - 我们成人了！
- Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!

44
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,637
- 成年蜜蜂 - 阿门！
- Bee-men. - Amen!

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,037
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

46
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,973
同学们、各位老师和尊贵的来宾们
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

47
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:35,036
请欢迎巴兹威尔（原文直译为“叫得好”） 院长讲话
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

48
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:40,343
欢迎来自新蜂房城
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of...

49
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,714
9:15班的毕业生
...9:15.

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,683
毕业典礼结束了
That concludes our ceremonies.

51
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:51,593
接着，你们在蜂房工业公司的 职业生涯马上开始！
And begins your career at Honex Industries!

52
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,222
我们今天就要选工作了？
Will we pick ourjob today?

53
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,164
我听说只是先了解一下情况
I heard it's just orientation.

54
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,225
抬起头！出发喽
Heads up! Here we go.

55
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:02,073
参观期间，请不要将头、手伸出车外
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
（用另一门语言又说了一遍）

57
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,908
- 不知道里面会是怎么样的呢？ - 真有点怕怕
- Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.

58
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,518
欢迎来到蜂房工业 它是蜂房控股下属的一个部门
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco

59
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,424
同时也是六角集团（蜂房为六角）的一部分
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

60
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,927
要到了！
This is it!

61
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,491
哇
Wow.

62
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,697
哇
Wow.

63
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,707
我们知道，作为一只蜜蜂
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life

64
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,075
必须将自己的一生奉献给事业
to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.

65
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:44,776
我们勇敢的授粉大队把花蜜带回蜂巢后 酿蜜的工作就开始了
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

66
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,613
我们的绝密配方就是
Our top-secret formula

67
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:50,883
自动色泽修正、气味调整还有气泡充入
is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

68
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,550
形成这种有着独特金色光泽的
into this soothing sweet syrup

69
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,562
镇静、香甜的糖浆 也就是你们所熟知的…
with its distinctive golden glow you know as...

70
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,791
蜂蜜！
Honey!

71
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,568
- 那个女孩不赖啊！ - 那是我表妹！
- That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!

72
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,832
- 啊？ - 是啊，我们大家都是表亲嘛
- She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.

73
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,637
- 对，你说得对 - 在蜂房工业，我们致力于
- Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive

74
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,837
不断改善蜜蜂生活的方方面面
to improve every aspect of bee existence.

75
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,508
这些蜜蜂正在对一种新型头盔进行抗压测试
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.

76
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,090
- 你觉得他表现如何？ - 有待改善
- What do you think he makes? - Not enough.

77
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:39,695
这是我们的最新开发的生产流程：接蜜
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.

78
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,003
- 那是干什么的？ - 接住倒蜜罐里残留的蜜滴
- What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey

79
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,272
能为我们节约不少原料
that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.

80
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,839
谁都可以干接蜜员这份工作吗？
Can anyone work on the Krelman?

81
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,943
当然可以啦，我们做的大部分工作都很琐碎
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know

82
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,751
但我们清楚：做好每一个细节 就能成就大事业
that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.

83
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,724
但选择要谨慎
But choose carefully

84
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:05,492
因为，你选定一行之后，下半辈子就没得改了
because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.

85
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:09,626
同一个工作，干一辈子？我事先怎么不知道？
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.

86
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,431
现在知道也没什么区别
What's the difference?

87
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:16,864
很高兴告诉大家： 作为一个物种，2700万年来
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off

88
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,433
蜜蜂从未停歇过一天
in 27 million years.

89
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,213
这么说来，我们只能工作到死？
So you'll just work us to death?

90
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,509
当然，我们会尽力做到
We'll sure try.

91
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,459
哇！真是大开眼界了！
Wow! That blew my mind!

92
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,329
“现在知道没有什么区别” 你怎么能说那样的话？
"What's the difference?" How can you say that?

93
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,740
一份工做到死？必须作出这样的选择，多傻
One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.

94
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,143
我可是松了一口气 现在我们一生只需要作一次选择
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.

95
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,240
不过，亚当，他们怎么可以不告诉我们呢？
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?

96
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,808
为什么你总是挑三捡四？我们只是蜜蜂而已 （街边的牌子：“蜜蜂陷入疯狂：猛叮7人随后自尽”）
Why would you question anything? We're bees.

97
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:03,878
我们是地球上 组织最严密的群体了
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.

98
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:09,486
难道你从来就没有想过 一切都安排得太好了吗？
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?

99
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,552
比如呢？举个例子来看看
Like what? Give me one example.

100
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,762
我说不出来，但是你知道我想说什么
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.

101
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:24,267
请无关人员离开大门，皇家采蜜队即将归巢
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.

102
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,208
等下，看看吧
Wait a second. Check it out.

103
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,576
- 看，是授粉大队！ - 哇哦
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.

104
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,284
我从来没有在这么近的距离看过他们
I've never seen them this close.

105
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,693
他们知道蜂巢外面是什么样的
They know what it's like outside the hive.

106
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,526
说得是没错，不过，有些没能回来
Yeah, but some don't come back.

107
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,190
- 嘿，勇士们！ - 嗨，英雄们！
- Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
（花蜜）

109
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,316
你们真是好样的！
You guys did great!

110
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,829
你们这帮怪物，飞天英雄！ 我爱死你们了！爱死了！
You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

111
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:20,330
- 真想知道他们刚刚去过哪里 - 我也不知道
- I wonder where they were. - I don't know.

112
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,832
他们过着毫无约束的生活
Their day's not planned.

113
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,427
飞到在蜂巢外面大家不知道的地方 做着大家不知道的事情
Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.

114
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:29,497
你不是想当授粉员就能当的 他们就是为了授粉而生的
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.

115
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,239
是啊
Right.

116
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,112
看这些花粉，你和我可能这辈子 都见不到这么多
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.

117
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:39,673
只是身份的象征而已，蜜蜂们太在意身份了
It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.

118
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:45,452
可能吧，除非你把它们洒在身上 而又正好被姑娘们看见了
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.

119
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,186
那些姑娘？她们不也是我们的表亲吗？
Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?

120
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,921
远亲，远亲
Distant. Distant.

121
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,327
看看他俩
Look at these two.

122
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,367
- 两个小淘气鬼罢了 - 逗逗他们去
- Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.

123
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,766
当授粉员一定很危险吧
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.

124
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,862
可不是！有一次，一只熊把我按在蘑菇上！
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!

125
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:04,568
他一爪掐着我的喉咙，另一只爪来扇我耳光！ 左-右-开-弓
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!

126
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,134
- 天哪！ - 我从没有想过打倒他
- Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.

127
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,146
你当时在干什么？
What were you doing during this?

128
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,943
当然是一直尽力向总部发出警报啦
Trying to alert the authorities.

129
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:12,711
我可以给你签个名
I can autograph that.

130
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,720
今天外面有点大风哦，是不是啊，小兄弟？
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?

131
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,050
是啊，起风了
Yeah. Gusty.

132
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:20,580
我们计划明天去离蜂房大概六里地的 向日葵地采蜜
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.

133
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,183
- 六里是吧？ - 巴里！
- Six miles, huh? - Barry!

134
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,697
对我们来说，就像跳过一个水潭那么简单 但你们可能就不行
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.

135
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,698
- 也许我行 - 别逞强！
- Maybe I am. - You are not!

136
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,360
明天0900从J号门出发 （0900：表示9点，如15点为1500）
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

137
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:35,031
小鬼头，怎么样？你够胆来吗？
What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?

138
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,504
只要知道0900是什么意思，我就够胆去
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.

139
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,285
哟，要上班啦！
Hey, Honex!

140
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,619
老爸，吓我一跳
Dad, you surprised me.

141
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:54,955
你想好对什么感兴趣了吗？
You decide what you're interested in?

142
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,190
- 呃，有太多选择了 - 但你只能挑一个
- Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.

143
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,627
老爸，你有没有觉得每天重复同样的工作很无聊？
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?

144
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,691
乖儿子，我来跟你说说搅拌工作是怎样的
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

145
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,637
你抓起搅拌棍，一圈一圈地搅啊搅啊
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.

146
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:11,073
你会找到一种节奏，那感觉美妙极了
You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.

147
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,475
爸，你知道吗？
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,

148
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:16,946
我越想越觉得，我不适合呆在酿蜜车间里
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.

149
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,779
那你想干什么？ 每天气鼓鼓地怨天尤人？
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?

150
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,252
对搅拌工来说，那可是不称职的
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.

151
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,552
珍妮特，你的宝贝儿子还不知道 要不要去酿蜜呢！
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!

152
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:29,617
- 巴里，有时候你真逗 - 我可不是在开玩笑
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.

153
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,187
你当然不是在开玩笑，你要去酿蜜 我们的儿子，当然是搅拌工！
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

154
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,166
- 你要做搅拌工？ - 你们都没有听我讲话啊！
- You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!

155
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,964
等你看到我用的那些棍子就不会这样了
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

156
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:41,130
我现在说什么都无所谓了 我要刺一个蚂图案的纹身
I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

157
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,231
咱们开些新鲜蜂蜜来庆祝一下吧！
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

158
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:46,402
我要在喉咙上穿个孔，再刮一下触角
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.

159
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:50,847
和蚱蜢同居，镶金牙，见人就叫“狗”！
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

160
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,315
我真感到自豪
I'm so proud.

161
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,085

- We're starting work today! - Today's the day.

180

一只蜜蜂死了，就空出一个位子，懂吗？ 一只死了，另一只又死了
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.

181
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,542
死啦，死啦，然后又有两只死了

站着死，倒着死，这就是命！

190
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:22,037
- 我要出去 - 出去？出哪去？
- I'm going out. - Out? Out where?

191
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,699
- 出外面去 - 噢，千万不要去！
- Out there. - Oh, no!

192
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,471
在我开始一辈子的工作之前 我必须去外面见识一下

大家都知道，蜜蜂是不可以在雨中飞行的
and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.

206
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,907
所以像往常一样，大家都要小心
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,

207
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,640
小心扫把、球棒、狗、小鸟、熊和蝙蝠

Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.

把花蜜吸干！
All of you, drain those flowers!

226
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,899
哇，我出来了！
Wow! I'm out!

227
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,562
哇，我出来了！真是难以置信，我出来了
I can't believe I'm out!

228
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,899
天那么蓝
So blue.

229
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,412
飞翔是如此迅速和自由！

盒形风筝！
Box kite!

231
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,912
哇！
Wow!

232
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,261
花儿们！
Flowers!

233
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,810
我是蓝队长机，发现玫瑰花
This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.

234
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,905
向下30度俯冲，旋转下降
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

235
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,006
玫瑰花！
Roses!

236
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,881
30度，收到 旋转下降
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

237
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:35,061
站到一边去，小鬼，可能会弹到你
Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.

238
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,069
这只用一个花蜜收集器！
That is one nectar collector!

239
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,273
- 没这么近地见过授粉吧？ - 没有
- Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.

240
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:52,142
我在这里捡一点花粉 这里撒一点，那边撒一点
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,

241
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,516
在那朵花上撒一点，看到了吗？ 有点像玩魔术游戏一样
a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.

242
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,312
真是神奇，为什么要这样做呢？
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

243
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,225
因为花粉越多，花开得越盛 就越多花蜜，酿出来的蜂蜜就越多
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

244
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,421
好厉害啊
Cool.

245

247
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,819
等下，其中一朵花好像在动
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.

248
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,418
再说一遍？你发现了正在移动的花？
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?

249
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:38,993
没错
Affirmative.

250
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,106

毛茸茸的
Yeah, fuzzy.

255
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,117
有点化学味道
Chemical-y.

256
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,350
小心点，伙计，有点粘
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

257

我的上帝啊！
My sweet lord of bees!

258
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,685
傻小子，快下来！
Candy-brain, get off there!

259
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,520
麻烦来了！
Problem!

260
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,202
- 伙计们！ - 这可会出事哦
- Guys! - This could be bad.

261

我的妈呀
Mama's little boy.

265
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,044
你站错地方了，新丁！
You are way out of position, rookie!

266
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,381
让我回敬你一球厉害的！
Coming in at you like a missile!

267
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,951
救-命-啊！
Help me!

268
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,223
我觉得这些不是花
I don't think these are flowers.

269
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,819
- 要告诉他吗？ - 我觉得，他应该知道
- Should we tell him? - I think he knows.

270
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,227
这是什么来的呀？！
What is this?!

271
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,334
赛点
Match point!

272
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,398
亲爱的，你可以开始收拾包袱走人了 因为，你这样是自讨苦吃！
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!

273
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,415

274
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,241
噢，真恶心
Gross.

275
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,954
车里有只蜜蜂！
There's a bee in the car!

276
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,518
- 想想办法！ - 我正在开车
- Do something! - I'm driving!

277
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:50,424
- 小蜜蜂，你好
- Hi, bee. - He's back here!

278
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,224
它会蜇我的！
He's going to sting me!

279
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,734
都别动，你不动，它就不蜇你 别动！
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!

280
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,243
它眨眼了
He blinked!

281
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,336
喷他，奶奶！
Spray him, Granny!

282
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,903
你在干什么？
What are you doing?!

283
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,652
哇，外面真是刺激得难以置信
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.

284
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,984
我要回家了
I gotta get home.

285
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,262
不可以在雨中飞行
Can't fly in rain.

286
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,365
不可以在雨中飞行
Can't fly in rain.

287
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,431
不可以在雨中飞行
Can't fly in rain.

288
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,511
呼救！呼救！正在下降！
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

289
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,126
肯，麻烦你关一下窗
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?

290
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,857
看看我新做的简历，我把它做成了翻折的小册子
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.

291
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,728
看到了吗？可翻折的
You see? Folds out.

292
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,200
糟糕了，人越来越多，我可不想这样
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

293
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,869
那是什么？
What was that?

294
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,535
也许这次可以，试一次，再试一次…
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...

295
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,572
封住了！
Drapes!

296
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,637
真糟糕
That is diabolical.

297
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,652
真完美，我写上了所有的特殊技能 甚至我最喜欢的前十部电影
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

298
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,585
最喜欢哪部？星球大战？
What's number one? Star Wars?

299
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,122
我对那些…
Nah, I don't go for that...

300
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,389
东西不太特别感兴趣
...kind of stuff.

301
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,395
难怪我们不可以和他们说话，他们都是疯子
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.

302
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:35,695
我面试完的时候 他们都大吃一惊，不信我说的话
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

303
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,895
那里有太阳，也许可以出去
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

304
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,464
我记得太阳上没有写着大大的“75”
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.

305
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,675
我跟你说，我预见到了全球变暖
I predicted global warming.

306
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:54,582
我觉得越来越热，起初，我以为只有我这样
I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.

307
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,915
等下！住手！有蜜蜂！
Wait! Stop! Bee!

308
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:02,825
退后，用冬装靴子来打
Stand back. These are winter boots.

309
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,686
住手！
Wait!

310
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,292
不要伤害它！
Don't kill him!

311
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:11,426
你知道我对蜜蜂过敏！ 我会死的
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!

312
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,267
为什么觉得它条命比你的贱？
Why does his life have less value than yours?

313
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:19,870
为什么觉得它的命比你们的贱？ 这是你说的吗？
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?

314
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:24,938
我只是说所有生命都有它们的价值 你不了解它们也有思想感情
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.

315
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,441
我的简历！
My brochure!

316
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,628
走吧，小家伙
There you go, little guy.

317
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,538
我才不怕它呢，我只是对它过敏
I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.

318
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,077
为什么你不在简历上注明呢？
Put that on your resume brochure.

319
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,079
不是开玩笑的 我整张脸都会肿起来
My whole face could puff up.

320
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,138
把它写成是你的特长
Make it one of your special skills.

321
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,549
打人也是我的特长
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.

322
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,256
就这样，再见，维纳莎，谢谢
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

323
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:09,919
- 维纳莎，“酸奶之夜”就定在下周？ - 好的，肯，什么时候都行
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

324
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,155
- 你可以放点炸豆片在上面 - 再见
- You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.

325
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,494
- 我希望少点热量 - 再见
- Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.

326
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,463
我要对她说点什么
I gotta say something.

327
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,232
她救了我一命，我得对她说点什么
She saved my life. I gotta say something.

328
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,241
好，去就去
All right, here it goes.

329
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:42,352
假的
Nah.

330
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,698
我要说什么呢？
What would I say?

331
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,532
我可能真的会惹来麻烦
I could really get in trouble.

332
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,808
蜜蜂法律规定 不可以和人类说话
It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.

333
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,710
我真不相信我要这样做
I can't believe I'm doing this.

334
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,871
我一定要说
I've got to.

335
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,213
我不可以这样做，别这样！
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

336
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,149
不说，说，不说
No. Yes. No.

337
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,212
说吧，不行
Do it. I can't.

338
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,785
我怎么开头呢？“你喜欢爵士乐吗？”不，没用
How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

339
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,989
她来了，说啊，你这笨蛋！
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

340
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,827
你好！
Hi!

341
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,492
对不起
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,002
- 是你在说话吗？ - 是我
- You're talking. - Yes, I know.

343
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,332
你说话了！
You're talking!

344
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,736
很抱歉，非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

345
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:32,003
不，没关系，我知道我在发梦
No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.

346
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,203
但是我不记得我睡下了呀
But I don't recall going to bed.

347
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,373
我知道一定会吓着你
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.

348
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:42,249
只是有点惊讶，我的意思是说，蜜蜂说话了！
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!

349
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,881
没错，我本不该说话的
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,

350
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,016
但是，如果不是你…
but they were all trying to kill me.

351
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,424
他们都想弄死我
And if it wasn't for you...

352
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,895
我必须谢谢你，这是爸妈教我的
I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.

353
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,161
真有点怪
That was a little weird.

354
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,226
- 我和一只蜜蜂在说话 - 没错
- I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.

355
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,070
我对一只蜜蜂说话，蜜蜂也对我说话！
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!

356
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,939
我只是想对你说，我很感激你 我走了
I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.

357
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,343
- 等下！你怎么学会说话的？ - 学什么？
- Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?

358
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,882
学讲话
The talking thing.

359
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,216
我猜，和你一样 “妈妈、爸爸、亲爱的”自然就学会了
Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

360
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:17,720
- 真逗 - 就这样
- That's very funny. - Yeah.

361
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,089
蜜蜂都很风趣幽默的 如果我们不笑，就要哭着面对
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

362
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,218
笑哭都一样
Anyway...

363
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:24,591
你要点…
Can I...

364
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,094
- 什么吗？ - 比如？
...get you something? - Like what?

365
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,568
我也不知道，我是说… 我不知道，比如咖啡？
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?

366
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,968
我无意冒犯
I don't want to put you out.

367
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,302
不会很麻烦的，就几分钟的功夫
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

368
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,433
- 喝杯咖啡而已 - 我不想强迫你
- It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.

369
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:41,569
- 别傻了 - 实际上，我还真想来一杯
- Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.

370
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,943
你要吃糖酒蛋糕吗？
Hey, you want rum cake?

371
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,447
- 不用了 - 吃点吧
- I shouldn't. - Have some.

372
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:46,779
- 不，我不要 - 吃点吧
- No, I can't. - Come on!

373
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,046
我正想在这里减去几毫克
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

374
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,951
- 哪里？ - 这些条纹不会显瘦的
- Where? - These stripes don't help.

375
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,114
你一点都不胖！
You look great!

376
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,886
我觉得你不了解时尚
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.

377
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,182
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

378
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:58,025
没事
No.

379
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:03,895
他们飞上去麦迪逊的时候 他正在出租车里弄轮胎
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.

380
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,902
最后他终于到了那里
He finally gets there.

381
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,633
他从楼梯冲进教堂里 婚礼正在进行
He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.

382
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:13,803
然后他说，西瓜呢？ 我以为你在说“门瓜”
And he says, "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.

383
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:16,108
我为什么要嫁给一个“西瓜”？
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

384
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:24,517
这是蜜蜂之间流传的笑话吗？
Is that a bee joke?

385
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,113
差不多就这样吧
That's the kind of stuff we do.

386
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,158
对啊，很不同
Yeah, different.

387
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,252
那么，你打算怎么办，巴里？
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

388
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,320
工作的事情？我不知道
About work? I don't know.

389
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,858
我想为蜂巢尽我的责任 但是不想按照他们想要的方式
I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.

390
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,266
我理解你的感受
I know how you feel.

391
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,271
- 真的？ - 当然
- You do? - Sure.

392
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,799
我父母希望我成为一名律师或者医生 但是我想做花商
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

393
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,675
- 真的？ - 我唯一的爱好就是种花
- Really? - My only interest is flowers.

394
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:52,409
我们新的蜂后就是用相同的口号竞选成功的
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.

395
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,013
如果你可以看到
Anyway, if you look...

396
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,851
我的蜂房就在那里，看到了吗？
There's my hive right there. See it?

397
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,618
你们住在绵羊草地上！
You're in Sheep Meadow!

398
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:03,353
没错，我们就在乌龟池的边上！
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

399
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:08,195
不可能！我去过那个地方 有一次，我就在那里掉了一个趾环
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.

400
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,099
- 为什么女生要在脚趾上戴环？ - 为什么不可以？
- Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?

401
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,627
- 就像在你的膝盖上戴帽子一样 - 我会试试看
- It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.

402
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:18,436
- 你没事吧，小姐？ - 没事，我很好
- You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.

403
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,739
就是喝两杯咖啡而已！
Just having two cups of coffee!

404
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,617
好了，真的很开心，谢谢你请我喝咖啡
Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.

405
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:37,888
不客气
Yeah, it's no trouble.

406
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:41,796
抱歉我喝不完了，如果我喝完了，也得撑死了
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.

407
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,460
你可以…
Are you?

408
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:47,169
我可以带一块走吗？
Can I take a piece of this with me?

409
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,264
当然可以啦！给，带点回去
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

410
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,672
- 谢谢！ - 嗯
- Thanks! - Yeah.

411
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,044
好吧，呃，那么… 我想，我们会再见
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.

412
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,606
或者不再见
Or not.

413
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,578
没关系，巴里
OK, Barry.

414
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:04,644
再次多谢你…之前救了我
And thank you so much again... for before.

415
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,690
那件事啊？没什么
Oh, that? That was nothing.

416
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:09,487
呃，不是“没什么”，但是，不管怎样…
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

巨型、可怕的人类！他们是怎么样的？

又大又笨，他们说话疯疯癫癫的

他们吃很大的东西，开车很疯

433
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,023
真的？她是雌蜂？
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

434
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:19,358
- 不是黄蜂吧？！你父母会宰了你的！ - 不是，不是，不是黄蜂
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.

435
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,762
- 蜘蛛？ - 你知道我不喜欢蜘蛛
- Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.

436
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:25,029
其他人都喜欢八条腿的动物 觉得他们最性感
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.

437
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:26,433
我都不敢看那张脸
I can't get by that face.

438
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:29,129
那么她是谁？
So who is she?

439
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,267
她…她是…人类
She's... human.

440
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:36,211
不会吧，你该不会违反了蜜蜂法吧？
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.

441
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,381
- 她叫维纳莎 - 天啊
- Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.

442
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,384
她很善良，她是一个花商
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

443
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:44,216
不会吧！你和一个人类花商约会
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

444
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,820
我们不是约会
We're not dating.

445
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,951
你飞出了蜂房，和攻击我们的人类说话
You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes

446
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:53,656
他们用强力清洁剂、“M-80s”炸药 和八分长的雷管来摧毁我们的家园
with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

447
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,724
她救了我一命，而且，她了解我
She saved my life! And she understands me.

448
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:58,962
这事到此为止！
This is over!

449
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:00,526
尝尝这个
Eat this.

450
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,301
这事还没完！那是什么？
This is not over! What was that?

451
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,842
- 他们叫这“碎屑” - 如此刺激和美妙
- They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!

452
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,402
这不是他们吃的东西 这只是从他们吃的东西上面掉下来的！
And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!

453
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,414
- 你知道什么是肉桂卷吗？ - 不知道
- You know what a Cinnabon is? - No.

454
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:14,849
- 原料有面包、肉桂还有糖衣，加热… - 小点儿声
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...

455
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,977
坐下！
Sit down!

456
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,987
…很热！ -听我说！
...really hot! - Listen to me!

457
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:22,082
我们和他们不一样！我们就是我们 我们有我们生活的空间，他们也是
We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!

458
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,424
没错，但是谁能否认心的向往？
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?

459
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:28,260
没有什么向往，停止向往，听我说！
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!

460
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:32,598
你要以认识到我们是蜜蜂，伙计 我们是蜜蜂！
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!

461
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,433
- 我们是蜜蜂 - 我们是蜜蜂
- Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.

462
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:38,874
我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！ 我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

463
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,606
他在那儿呢，游泳池里
There he is. He's in the pool.

464
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,080
你知道你的问题出在哪儿吗，巴里？
You know what your problem is, Barry?

465
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:47,174
我要用蜜蜂思维来思考？
I gotta start thinking bee?

466
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,185
你还要消沉多久？
How much longer will this go on?

467
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:52,245
已经3天了！我搞不懂你为什么不去工作？
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?

468
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,087
我有很多人生的重大问题需要考虑
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.

469
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,391
什么人生？你没有人生！ 你没有工作，连只蜜蜂都算不上！
What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!

470
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:01,897
酿一点儿蜜会要了你的命吗？
Would it kill you to make a little honey?

471
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,833
巴里，上来，你爸在跟你说话呢
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.

472
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,767
马丁，你可以跟他谈谈吗？
Martin, would you talk to him?

473
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,532
巴里， 我在和你说话呢！
Barry, I'm talking to you!

474
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,326
你来吗？
You coming?

475
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,233
都准备好了吗？
Got everything?

476
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,402

维纳莎！
Vanessa!

481
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,873
- 我们还没走呢，巴里 - 我告诉你不要对他嚷嚷
- We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.

482
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,038
你对他嚷嚷，他就不理你
He doesn't respond to yelling!

483
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,275
- 那你为什么对我嚷嚷呢？ - 因为你不听我说
- Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!

484
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:26,976
我才不听这个
I'm not listening to this.

485
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,211
对不起，我要走了
Sorry, I've gotta go.

486
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:30,719
- 你去哪？ - 没啥，去见一个朋友
- Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.

487
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,518
女孩？所以你才无法作出决定？
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

488
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,683
再见
Bye.

489
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,023
希望她最好是蜂类的
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?

492

能够参加玫瑰展示锦标赛是每个花商的梦想
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!

站在在花车上，被鲜花和群众的欢呼所包围
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.

494
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:57,045
锦标赛，是玫瑰花们互相之间比赛吗？
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?

495
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:01,918
不是，嗯，我就得到过一次机会 为什么你坐着不飞呢？
No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?

496
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,251
太累了，你去别的地方为什么不用跑呢？ 那样不是快点吗？
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.

497
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:08,086
好了，好了，我知道了，该你问了
Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.

498
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,595
“替你录”（TiVo，一种录像机）是怎么回事 你们可以让电视直播停下来吗？真是太夸张了！
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!

499
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,323
你没有见过类似的吗？
You don't have that?

500
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:17,333
我们有“海沃（Hivo）”，但那是一种病毒 一种很恐怖、很恐怖的病毒
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.

501

天啊
Oh, my.

502
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:20,927
傻蜜蜂！
Dumb bees!

503
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,236
你一定很想蜇死那些混蛋
You must want to sting all those jerks.

504
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:27,368
我们会克制自己，通常蜇了他们 我们自己也会有生命危险
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.

505
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,936
这么说你很注意控制自己的脾气喽
So you have to watch your temper.

506

是啊，非常注意：通过踢墙、散步 写泄愤信然后扔掉
Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,

507
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:37,353
种种手段来发泄那些情绪
write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:

比如：愤怒、嫉妒或贪婪
Anger, jealousy, lust.

509
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,225

- 怎么回事啊，你！ - 是只小虫子
- What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.

感觉有10页，75页的话，我们差不多就死定了
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

516
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:03,204
你知道得不少
You've really got that down to a science.

517

这些怎么来的？“爱蜂”，“金色绽放”
How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

为什么？你们吃的东西还不够多吗？
You don't have enough food of your own?

524

- 嗯，是的 - 你们怎么弄到这些蜂蜜的？
- Well, yes. - How do you get it?

525
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,904
- 蜜蜂酿造的 - 我知道是谁酿的！
- Bees make it. - I know who makes it!

526
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,839
我还知道酿造过程很不容易呢！
And it's hard to make it!

527
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,675
要加热、冷却、搅拌，还要接蜜 一点都不能浪费
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!

528
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,044
- 那是有机物 - 那是“我”机物！
- It's organic. - It's our-ganic!

529
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:39,446
蜂蜜而已啊，巴里
It's just honey, Barry.

530
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,109
什么，“而已”？
Just what?!

531
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,848
蜜蜂们都不知道这件事！这是偷窃！ 很严重的偷窃！
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

532
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,858
你们已经夺走了我们的家、学校和医院 这是我们唯一剩下的了
You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!

533

And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.

534
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,860
我一定要把事情查个水落石出！
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!

535
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,029
嗨，赫克托
Hey, Hector.

536
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,541

He is here. I sense it.

538
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,159
好了，我该回家了
Well, I guess I'll go home now

539
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:27,493
把这香甜的蜂蜜留在空无一人的仓库里
and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.

540
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,396
人赃并获，小偷！
You're busted, box boy!

541
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,063
我就听到有声音，原来你会说话！
I knew I heard something. So you can talk!

542
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,004
没错，现在该你说了
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!

543
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:39,167
你从哪儿弄来这些蜂蜜的？谁是你的供货商？
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?

544
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,837
我听不懂你在说什么，我觉得我们是朋友
I don't understand. I thought we were friends.

545
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,574
我最讨厌让朋友（指蜜蜂）伤心了！
The last thing we want to do is upset bees!

546
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,676
你来晚了！蜂蜜现在是我们的了！
You're too late! It's ours now!

547
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,345
先生，你，找错对手了！
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!

548
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,754
先生，你，将会成为我养的大蜥蜴的午餐！
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!

549

蜂蜜从哪里来的？
Where is the honey coming from?

550
00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:59,456
哪里来的？
Tell me where!

551

这里发生了什么悲剧吗？
What horrible thing has happened here?

554
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:08,563
看看这些脸，他们都不知道这是怎么一回事
These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now

555
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,362
现在又要去一个不知名的地方
they're on the road to nowhere!

556
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,164
别动
Just keep still.

557
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,761
什么？你还没有死？
What? You're not dead?

558
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,907
我看起来像死了吗？他们会把会动的都扫走 你去哪儿？
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?

559
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,002
养蜂场，我有重任在身
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.

560
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,448
我要去阿拉斯加，喝驼鹿血，美味啊，棒极了！
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

561
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,451
我要去塔科马港
I'm going to Tacoma.

562
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,612
- 那你呢？ - 他是真死了
- And you? - He really is dead.

563
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,950
那算了
All right.

564
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,216
大事不好！
Uh-oh!

565
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,258
- 那是什么？ - 不要！
- What is that?! - Oh, no!

566
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,316
- 雨刷器！三层刀刃的！ - 三层刀刃？
- A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?

567
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:40,056
跳上来！这是你唯一的机会，蜜蜂小弟！
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

568
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,396
为什么所有东西都要那么干净？
Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!

569
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,629
你们人类看多少是多啊？！
How much do you people need to see?!

570
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,764
睁大双眼！ 把头伸出窗外！
Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!

571
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,037
全国公共广播，我是卡尔・卡塞尔 以下是来自华盛顿的消息
From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell.

572
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,670
不要再残杀生灵了！
But don't kill no more bugs!

573
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,506
- 蜜蜂小弟！ - 鹿血大哥！
- Bee! - Moose blood guy!!

574
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,290
- 你听到吗？ - 听到什么？
- You hear something? - Like what?

575
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:12,692
像是很小声的喊叫
Like tiny screaming.

576
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,261
把收音机关掉
Turn off the radio.

577
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,068
我们又见面了，小蜜蜂
Whassup, bee boy?

578
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,874
好啊，血哥
Hey, Blood.

579
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:33,144
目之所及，都是整排整排的蜂蜜罐
Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.

580
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,411
哇！
Wow!

581
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:38,148
所以我推测，这些卡车去的地方 就是蜂蜜的来源地
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.

582
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,655
我的意思是说，这些蜂蜜是我们的
I mean, that honey's ours.

583
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,987
- 蜜蜂很团结 - 我们都住在一起
- Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.

584
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,651
是一个很紧密的群体
It's a close community.

585
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:47,720
我们蚊子不是，都是单干的，各顾各的
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.

586
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:51,325
- 你遇到麻烦了怎么办？ - 你是蚊子，本身就是个麻烦
- What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.

587
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:54,837
没有人欢迎我们，杀无赦！杀、杀、杀无赦！
Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!

588
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,874
起码我们出来见过世面了 你一定遇到过很多女孩
At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.

589
00:37:57,941 --> 00:38:02,207
雌蚊都想钓金龟婿，攀上飞蛾、蜻蜓之类的
Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.

590
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,406
雌蚊都不想嫁给蚊子
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

591
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,074
我不是做梦吧！（它看见了送血车）
You got to be kidding me!

592
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,553
鹿血哥要走了哦！后会有期，蜜蜂老弟！
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!

593
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,450
- 弟兄们都在啊！ - 血哥来啦！
- Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!

594
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:18,127
我就知道你们会在这里，吸管准备好没？
I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?

595
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:38,407
只要装到罐子里，贴个标签就赚钱了 真是无本万利啊
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.

596
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,006
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

597
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,483
蜜蜂只有针头那么丁点大的脑袋
A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.

598
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,043
蜜蜂都没脑的！
They are pinheads!

599
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,653
没脑
Pinhead.

600
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,851
- 看看新的喷雾枪 - 噢，太好啦，正合你意
- Check out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

601
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,520
托马斯3000型！
The Thomas 3000!

602
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,620
喷雾枪？
Smoker?

603
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:58,600
射速90次/分，半自动 焦油含量，尼古丁的两倍
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

604
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,670
吸几口，它们就立刻动弹不得
A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.

605
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,676
它们酿蜜，我们进“米”（赚钱）
They make the honey, and we make the money.

606
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:11,270
他们进“米”，我们酿蜜？
"They make the honey, and we make the money"?

607
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,292
天啊！
Oh, my!

608
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,200
发生什么事情了？你们没事吧？
What's going on? Are you OK?

609
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,505
没事，很快就好了
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

610
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:44,479
你们怎么来了这里？你们知道 你们住在一个带假墙的假巢里吗？
Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?

611
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,914
我们的蜂后搬到这里来了，我们别无选择
Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.

612
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:50,681
这是你们的蜂后吗？一个穿着裙子的老爷们儿！
This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!

613
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:52,722
一个男扮女装的蜂后！
That's a drag queen!

614
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:59,058
这又是怎么回事？
What is this?

615
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,032
不会吧！
Oh, no!

616
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,733
这里有上千个！
There's hundreds of them!

617
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:22,912
蜂蜜
Bee honey.

618
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:27,355
人类大规模厚颜无耻地盗取我们的蜂蜜！
Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!

619
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:31,622
这比熊的所作所为还要恶劣！ 我一定要采取行动
This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.

620
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,787
噢，巴里，够了
Oh, Barry, stop.

621
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,957
谁告诉你是人类拿走了我们的蜂蜜？谣言罢了
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.

622
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,024
这些看起来像是谣言吗？
Do these look like rumors?

623
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:41,764
这一切都是阴谋，这些相片很明显是处理过的
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.

624
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:44,033
你怎么会真假不分呢？
How did you get mixed up in this?

625
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,631
因为他和人类说过话
He's been talking to humans.

626
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,438
- 什么？ - 和人类说话？
- What? - Talking to humans?!

627
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,378
他交了个人类女朋友，而且他们还约会过
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!

628
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:51,971
还约会了？巴里！
Make out? Barry!

629
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,209
才没有
We do not.

630
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:55,478
- 你说你想过 - 你到底算哪边的？
- You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?

631
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,780
当然是蜜蜂这边
The bees!

632
00:40:56,853 --> 00:41:01,654
有一次我和一只蟋蟀在圣安尼奥约会 那些脚让我一晚上都没睡好
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

633
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,455
巴里，你就想过这样的日子吗？
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?

634
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:08,259
我这是为了大家好，没有人比蜜蜂更勤劳了！
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!

635
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,823
爸，我记得你回家的时候多累
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked

636
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,961
你的手还在不停地搅拌，根本听不下来
your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.

637
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:15,561
我记得
I remember that.

638
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,073
他们凭什么拿走我们的蜂蜜？
What right do they have to our honey?

639
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:22,134
我们每年只用两杯蜂蜜，他们却无缘无故 用蜂蜜来做唇膏！
We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

640
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:24,908
即使那是真的，蜜蜂能做什么？
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

641
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,745
我要狠狠叮他们的要害
Sting them where it really hurts.

642
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,079
脸上！眼睛！
In the face! The eye!

643
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,379
- 那样很疼的 - 不是
- That would hurt. - No.

644
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,182
叮鼻子？绝
Up the nose? That's a killer.

645
00:41:31,254 --> 00:41:35,884
只有一个地方可以让人类屈服，只有一个
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.

intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,

655
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:11,922
灌装蜂蜜用以非法牟利！
packaging it and profiting from it illegally!

656

Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

660
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:31,547
你有没有想过，“我只不过是蜂房里的 一个小孩，我做不来这个？”
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?

661
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,209
蜜蜂从来不畏惧去改变世界
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.

662
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:37,549
难道你忘了蜂・哥伦布？蜂・甘地？蜂・耶稣？
What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

663
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,146
作为蜜蜂一员，你不应该想着控告人类
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

664
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:43,317
我们应该想着捏糖球或者储存糖料
We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.

665
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:44,758
您今年多大了？
How old are you?

666
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,161
我跟你说吧，整个蜜蜂社会在 这个案子上都支持你
The bee community is supporting you in this case,

667
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:51,064

677
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:22,956
在网球场上，你要攻击对手的弱项
In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!

678
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,867
但那可是我奶奶啊，肯，她都81岁了
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

679
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,600
宝贝，她的反手球对我来说可是个好机会啊 我怎么可能放过？
Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

680
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,370
安静点，行不，我这在做正经事呢
Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.

681
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:36,708
- 难道还是上次那只蜜蜂？ - 是的，是我！

I'm helping him sue the human race.

683
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,715
- 你好 - 你好，蜜蜂

684
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,048
这位是肯
This is Ken.

685
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:49,218
是的，我记得你，丛林靴，10号半的 伐柏拉姆牌，肯定没错
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

686
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,624
为什么他又说起话了？
Why does he talk again?

687
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,630
听着，你最好离开因为我们现在可忙了
Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.

688
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,893
可是今天是我们的“酸奶之夜”！
But it's our yogurt night!

689
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,298
拜拜
Bye-bye.

690
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,904
为什么过个“酸奶之夜”这么费劲啊？！
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

691
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,841
噢，可怜的小家伙们 你们两个已经足足搞了几个钟头了
You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!

692
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,140
没错，亚当能来这儿可是帮了“大忙”了
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.

693
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:10,141
（肉桂卷）

694
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:12,679
- 糖衣… - 要几块糖？
- Frosting... - How many sugars?

695
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,979
就一块吧，我尽量少用对手的产品
Just one. I try not to use the competition.

696
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,452
嗯，你干嘛要帮我呢？
So why are you helping me?

697
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,387
蜜蜂们有着让人尊敬的品行
Bees have good qualities.

698
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,253
这感觉挺好，免得成天惦记花店
And it takes my mind off the shop.

699
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:28,457
不知道为什么，鲜花被取代了 人们全都改用气球花束了
Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.

700
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,932
是啊，那个也不错，前提是你只有三岁
Those are great, if you're three.

701
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,559
还有人造花呢
And artificial flowers.

702
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:36,595
-噢，那听起来真让人抓狂 -没错，我也是
- Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.

703
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:39,073
塑料花会导致蜂刺折断、传粉失去意义
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

704
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:41,269
蜜蜂一定不喜欢这些伪造的塑料货！
Bees must hate those fake things!

705
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,904
最糟的就是一朵水仙花无粉可传
Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.

706
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,143
嗯嗯，或许这个可以让我们稍稍得些补偿
Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.

707
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,084
- 你应该知道，巴里，这次诉讼可非同小可 - 我猜是吧
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.

708
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:52,451
你确定你真的想把它寄出去吗？
You sure you want to go through with it?

709
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:55,423
我确不确定？一旦我控诉人类成功 他们再也不敢说
Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able

710
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,188
“小蜜糖，我回来了”，却不交一分税
to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a royalty!

711
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,361
这里是曼哈顿市中心，一切都这么不可思议
It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,

712
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:08,666
在这里所有人都有焦急地等待着 因为这将是历史上的第一次
where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,

713
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:13,698
我们将亲自见证一只蜜蜂是否真的 可以开口说话
we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.

714
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,406
我们来这儿到底是为了什么，巴里？
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

715
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:22,314
我也不知道，但是这里确实挺大，不是吗？
It's pretty big, isn't it?

716
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:25,479
真不敢相信有这么多人，大白天的没事做
I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.

717
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:29,787
你猜这些资产上亿美元的跨国食品公司 请得起顶级大律师吗？
You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?

718
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,552
所有人都站到路障后面
Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.

719
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,403
- 怎么了？ - 我也不知道，突然打了个冷颤
- What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.

720
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,747
嗯，如果不是你们蜜蜂的话
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

721
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,846
我还喝不着这个（蜂蜜）呢？
You boys work on this?

722
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:06,522
全体起立！有请尊敬的法官邦博顿大人
All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.

723
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:09,224
好，第4475号案件
All right. Case number 4475,

724
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:13,702
纽约高等法院 巴里・蜂・班森指控蜂蜜产业公司
Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. The Honey Industry

725
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,499
现在正式开庭
is now in session.

726
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:20,168
蒙哥马利先生，你是全权代表 这五家食品公司的，是不是？
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?

727
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,040
全权的
A privilege.

728
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:27,448
班森先生…你是不是代表了全世界的蜜蜂？
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?

729
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,264
开个玩笑，是的，法官大人 我们已经准备就续了
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.

730
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:46,935
蒙哥马利先生，由你首先做开庭陈述，请吧
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.

731
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:52,066
陪审团的各位女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

732
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,236
我的奶奶是名普通的妇女
my grandmother was a simple woman.

733
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:59,009
出生在一个农场，她相信人类有权
Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right

734
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:04,145
从上帝恩赐的大自然万物中得益
to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.

735
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,316
如果我们活在一个逻辑颠倒的世界 如班森先生所想的话
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,

736
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:10,154
想想那意味着什么吧
just think of what would it mean.

737
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:13,423
也许，我不得不去跟桑蚕谈判
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm

738
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:16,761
因为我穿着带着松紧带的裤子
for the elastic in my britches!

739
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,926
会说话的蜜蜂！
Talking bee!

740
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,493
我们怎么确定这不是什么
How do we know this isn't some sort of

741
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:25,098
好莱坞全新使用的全息动态影像捕捉技术
holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?

742
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,939
他们可以使用激光电波！
They could be using laser beams!

743
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:32,505
机器人！口技！克隆！就我们所知
Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know,

744
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:35,176
它极可能是堆类固醇做的！
he could be on steroids!

745
00:47:36,986 --> 00:47:38,681
班森先生？
Mr. Benson?

746
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:47,390
女士们先生们，这里绝对没有什么障眼法
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.

747
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:51,195
我只不过是只普普通通的蜜蜂 作为蜜蜂，蜂蜜对我来说极为重要
I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.

748
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:54,065
它对所有蜜蜂来说都很重要，我们创造了蜂蜜！
It's important to all bees. We invented it!

749
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,300
我们制造它，而且我们用生命来捍卫它
We make it. And we protect it with our lives.

750
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,104
不幸的是，这里有些人
Unfortunately, there are some people in this room

751
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:01,973
认为他们可以从我们身边抢走 任何他们想要的东西
who think they can take it from us

752
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:06,175
而就因为我们长得很渺小！ 所以我希望，当这一切都结束之后
'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

753
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:10,811
你们就会明白，夺走我们的蜂蜜 不仅仅是夺走我们的所有
you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have

754
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,718
更是夺走了我们的生命！
but everything we are!

755
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:19,456
真希望他一直穿成这样，帅极了！
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!

756
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,258
传第一位证人上庭
Call your first witness.

757
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:26,098
那么，克劳斯・范德海登先生 “蜂蜜农庄”的总裁，你的公司可真不小啊
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.

758
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,500
我想是的
I suppose so.

759
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,336
而且我还查出你还拥有 “蜂蜜毁灭者”和“蜂蜜收割者”！
I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!

760
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,241
是的，他们为我们农场提供养蜂人
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.

761
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,837
“养蜂人”，我觉得这是个很有迷惑性的字眼
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.

762
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:41,850
我想你们没雇佣“放蜂人”吧，是不是？
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?

763
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,852
- 没有 - 不好意思，我听不见
- No. - I couldn't hear you.

764
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,251
- 没有 - 没有
- No. - No.

765
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:48,984
因为你们不会把蜜蜂放出来的 你们把蜜蜂关着，不仅如此
Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,

766
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:53,927
看来你还认为熊的形象用来做蜂蜜罐比较合适
it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

767
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,522
嗯嗯，他们都是比较可爱的动物
They're very lovable creatures.

768
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:00,126
瑜珈熊，福滋熊，泰迪熊
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

769
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,534
没错，你是说像这个一样？
You mean like this?

770
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,106
熊专杀蜜蜂！
Bears kill bees!

771
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,871
你会愿意让一头熊钻到你的卧室吗？
How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!

772
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,007
它会咬烂你的睡床！撕烂你的睡枕！
Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!

773
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,780
好了，够了，带它出去吧
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

774
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:27,092
嗯，斯汀（Sting，叮）先生，谢谢你能出席 你的名字让我很感兴趣
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.

775
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:31,156
- 我在哪听过吗？ - 我以前参加过警察乐队（The Police）
- Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.

776
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,896
但是你从来没有当过警察什么的，是不是？
But you've never been a police officer, have you?

777
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,232
没有，我没当过
No, I haven't.

778
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,832
没有，你没当过，那么现在我们 又有了另一个例子
No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example

779
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:41,240
那就是蜜蜂文化肆意被人类盗用
of bee culture casually stolen by a human

780
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,075
用来做为那些只会乱蹦的人的艺名
for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.

781
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,409
噢，拜托
Oh, please.

782
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,643
你有没有曾经被叮过，斯汀先生？
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

783
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:50,584
因为我觉得有点被叮的剌痛，斯汀先生
Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.

784
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:55,147
或者我应该叫你…戈登・M・萨默尔先生！
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

785
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,390
那不是他的真名吗？！你们这群白痴！
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

786
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:03,529
利奥塔先生，首先我要呈上我迟到的祝贺
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on

787
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,899
祝贺你凭借《ER》 获得2005年度艾美奖最佳客串男演员 （2005年黄金段艾美奖 雷・利奥塔 剧情类最佳客串男演员）
your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.

788
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,835
谢谢，谢谢！
Thank you. Thank you.

789
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,135
我看过你的履历，你真是太帅了
I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome

790
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:16,406
就像奶油翻浆，帅的几乎冒油了
with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.

791
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:18,947
我只是做我喜欢的事，这也算犯罪吗？
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

792
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:22,280
现在还不是，不过，难道这就是你的初衷？
Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?

793
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,786
剥削弱小、无助的小蜜蜂们
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't

794
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:28,620
这样你就用不着成天排练节目 背你的台词了，啊，先生？
have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?

795
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:31,216
小心点，班森！ 我现在就可以给你点颜色看看！
Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!

796
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,422
他不是好家伙！他是个坏家伙！ （引用利奥塔主演的电影《好家伙》）
This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!

797
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,131
为什么没人一脚踩死这只小虫子 这样大家都可以回家了！
Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!

798
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,898
- 肃静，法庭上请保持肃静！ - 你们都是这么想的！
- Order in this court! - You're all thinking it!

799
00:50:41,971 --> 00:50:43,097
肃静！肃静，我说肃静！
Order! Order, I say!

800
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,770
- 说出来啊！ - 利奥塔先生，请坐下！
- Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

801
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,071
（原告竟是小蜜蜂！！！）

802
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:48,972
（蜜蜂指控人类：紧急休庭）

803
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:51,073
（《每日综艺》：公司撤资利奥塔的项目）

804
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,779
我觉得那样棒极了，那头熊表现十分到位！
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.

805
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,376
跟你说吧，我想陪审团是站在我们这一边的
I think the jury's on our side.

806
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,447
我们做的都是对的吗，我是说，合法的？
Are we doing everything right, legally?

807
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:01,683
我只是个养花的
I'm a florist.

808
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:05,319
是啊是啊，嗯，敬伟大的团队
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

809
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,726
敬伟大的团队！
To a great team!

810
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,362
嗯，你好
Well, hello.

811
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,401
-  噢，肯！ - 你好
- Ken! - Hello.

812
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:14,527
我没想到你还能来
I didn't think you were coming.

813
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:19,667
那个，我只是迟到罢了 我试过打电话，不过…这破电池
No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.

814
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:24,008
我不想浪费这一桌美餐，于是我叫了巴里 幸运的是他正好有空
I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

815
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,079
噢，确实很幸运
Oh, that was lucky.

816
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,217
还有点儿吃的，我可以帮你热一下
There's a little left. I could heat it up.

817
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:34,586
对，把它热一下，当然了，我不在意
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

818
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,291
噢，我听说你是个不折不扣的网球手
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

819
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,925
我自己不大擅长这项运动，那个网球很是缠人
I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.

820
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:50,762
那个是我通常坐的位置，就是…那里
That's where I usually sit. Right... there.

821
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,707
肯，巴里看过了你的简历
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

822
00:51:55,778 --> 00:52:01,045
他也同意我的看法，用筷子吃东西不算什么技术
and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

823
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,052
你真以为我看不懂你在干嘛？
You think I don't see what you're doing?

824
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,783
我明白，确实很难找份合适的工作 我们在这点上有共识
I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.

825
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,024
是吗？
Do we?

826
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:14,496
蜜蜂是百分百的可以就业 可惜我们净做些类似挑垃圾的活
Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

827
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,397
那正是我考虑要做的事
That's just what I was thinking about doing.

828
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:22,461
肯，我让巴里用你的剃须刀来刮绒毛 希望你别介意
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

829
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,836
我去冲一冲这根老化的蜂刺
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

830
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:30,640
好的，你请自便
Yeah, you do that.

831
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,644
看看这个
Look at that.

832
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,759
你知道不，我刚刚看到它
You know, I've just about had it

833
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,765
正好想起来你的心灵小游戏
with your little mind games.

834
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,358
- 什么东西？ - 《意大利时尚》杂志！
- What's that? - Italian Vogue.

835
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,097
我的妈呀，那可有太多页了
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

836
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,638
都是些广告
A lot of ads.

837
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,971
还记得维纳莎说的话吗 为什么你的命会比我的值钱？
Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?

838
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,570
奇怪，我就是想不起来了！
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

839
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,381
我看这有东西发臭了！
I think something stinks in here!

840
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,940
我喜欢这种花的味道
I love the smell of flowers.

841
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,953
那么你喜不喜欢火的味道？
How do you like the smell of flames?!

842
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,079
没那么喜欢
Not as much.

843
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,963
我是蟑螂！保持中立！
Water bug! Not taking sides!

844
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,504
肯，看看我，带着唇膏盖帽子，真是可怜的很
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic!

845
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:38,274
我来帮你解难！
I've got issues!

846
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,745
好啊，好啊，好啊，好好冲个凉吧
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

847
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,813
- 你只是虚张声势 - 噢，是吗？
- You're bluffing. - Am I?

848
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,868
冲浪来喽，伙计！
Surf's up, dude!

849
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:00,925
啊，便池水！
Poo water!

850
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,502
这块洼滩可不怎么平
That bowl is gnarly.

851
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,012
除了那些脏兮兮的黄圈！
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

852
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,513
肯尼思！你在干嘛？！
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

853
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,018
你知道吗，我根本不喜欢蜂蜜！我连吃都不吃！
You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!

854
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:17,950
我们得谈谈！
We need to talk!

855
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,954
他只不过是只小蜜蜂！
He's just a little bee!

856
00:54:20,022 --> 00:54:25,016
而且我发现他是我这么长时间以来见过的 最好的蜜蜂
And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

857
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:30,361
“这么长时间以来”？你在说什么啊？！ 还有其他的虫子闯进你的生活？
Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?

858
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:35,370
没有，但是却有些其他东西像虫子一样 烦着我的生活，而你就是其中一个！
No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!

859
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,373
好极了！会说话的蜜蜂、不过“酸奶之夜”…
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

860
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,707
我的神经已经受不了这过山车似的折磨了！
My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!

861
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,679
再见了，肯
Goodbye, Ken.

862
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,275
告诉你一件事
And for your information,

863
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:55,620
我喜欢无糖食品，人工甜料，人造的！
I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!

864
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,726
对此我很抱歉
I'm sorry about all that.

865
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,458
我知道它吃完会有余味！ 我喜欢那个！
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!

866
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,433
我总觉着肯和我之间有些隔阂
I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.

867
00:55:07,503 --> 00:55:10,165
我却没法逾越，噢，算了
I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.

868
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,070
你没问题吧，关于明天的庭审？
Are you OK for the trial?

869
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:15,872
我想蒙哥马利先生已经黔驴技穷了
I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.

870
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,676
我们想有请巴里・蜂・班森先生上证人席
We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

871
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:24,049
好主意！这回你就可以看看为什么他被 视为顶级大律师了…
Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...

872
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,680
好吧
Yeah.

873
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:30,082
莱顿，你必须得想点奇招
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic

874
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,423
说服这些陪审员，否则的话一切都完了
with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.

875
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,864
别担心，加莫先生，只一件事就可让 陪审团回心转意
Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around

876
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,664
那就是让他们想起他们最反感蜜蜂的什么
is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.

877
00:55:40,736 --> 00:55:43,204
- 你带了镊子吧？ - 你不过敏吧？
- You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?

878
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:46,105
只对失败过敏，孩子，只对失败过敏！
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

879
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,942
蜂・班森先生，我想问个大家都关心的问题
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.

880
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:54,449
你到底和那位女士…
What exactly is your relationship

881
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,508
是什么关系？
to that woman?

882
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,843
我们是朋友
We're friends.

883
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:00,218
- 好朋友？ - 是的
- Good friends? - Yes.

884
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:03,452
有多好？你们住在一起吗？
How good? Do you live together?

885
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,993
等一下，这些都是关于…
Wait a minute...

886
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,688
你是不是她的小…
Are you her little...

887
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:08,527
…同居小虫？
...bedbug?

888
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,863
我看过关于蜜蜂的记录片约有一两部 从中我了解到
I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,

889
00:56:12,935 --> 00:56:16,735
难道不是你们的蜂后生下 你们所有小孩吗
doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?

890
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,741
- 是的，但是… - 那就是说那些不是你真正的父母！
- Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!

891
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,674
- 噢，巴里… - 不，他们是！
- Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!

892
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:23,575
快拉住我！
Hold me back!

893
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,171
你是只私生蜂，不是吗，班森？
You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?

894
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,580
他竟然公开诋毁蜜蜂！
He's denouncing bees!

895
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,244
难道你们与之约会的不都是兄妹吗？
Don't y'all date your cousins?

896
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,049
- 反对！ - 我要蜇死这家伙！
- Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!

897
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,120
亚当，不要！这正是他想要的！
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

898
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:45,496
啊，我被袭了！
Oh, I'm hit!!

899
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,661
噢，上帝！我被袭了！
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

900
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,364
肃静！肃静！
Order! Order!

901
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:52,669
毒液！毒液正贯穿我全身！
The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!

902
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,701
我要被毒死了，就是被那只带翅膀的畜牲！
I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!

903
00:56:56,779 --> 00:57:01,478
你们看到了？没法对它们平等相待 它们兽性未除！
You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!

904
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:06,112
叮人是他们脑里唯一的事，这就是蜜蜂！
Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!

905
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:08,918
- 亚当，坚持住 - 我的双腿失去知觉了
- Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.

906
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:14,161
哪位天使姐姐能帮我吸吸毒
What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison

907
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,027
从我这翘起的屁股上？
from my heaving buttocks?

908
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,862
我命令大家保持肃静，这是法庭！
I will have order in this court. Order!

909
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,426
肃静，请肃静！
Order, please!

910
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:27,307
这起关于蜜蜂起诉人类的案件
The case of the honeybees versus the human race

911
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:29,640
却反将矛头指向了蜜蜂一族
took a pointed turn against the bees

912
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:34,376
就在昨天他们的一位成员蜇伤了 莱顿・T・蒙哥马利
yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

913
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,397
- 嗨，兄弟 - 嗨
- Hey, buddy. - Hey.

914
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:50,955
- 还很疼吗？ - 是啊
- Is there much pain? - Yeah.

915
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,100
我…
I...

916
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,466
我搞砸了整个案子，是不是？
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

917
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,408
这不要紧，重要的是你还活着，你本来会死的
It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.

918
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:04,241
我倒宁愿死掉，看看我
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

919
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:09,250
这是他们从楼下的餐厅弄来的 夹在金枪鱼三明治中的
They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

920
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:12,151
你看看，这还有一点芹菜挂在上面
Look, there's a little celery still on it.

921
00:58:12,621 --> 00:58:14,816
那是一种什么感觉，当你叮人的时候？
What was it like to sting someone?

922
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,256
我也没法解释，就感觉…
I can't explain it. It was all...

923
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:20,818
血往上涌，然后…然后就感觉心醉神迷
All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!

924
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:25,160
好吧
All right.

925
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:27,259
你认为那是个陷阱？
You think it was all a trap?

926
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:30,567
当然了，对不起，是我把咱们卷进来的
Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.

927
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:35,042
我们在想什么？看看咱俩 只不过是世界上一对小虫子而已
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.

928
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,443
人类会怎么对付我们，万一他们赢了的话？
What will the humans do to us if they win?

929
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:38,775
我不知道
I don't know.

930
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,284
我听说他们把蟑螂养在旅馆里 听起来也不坏
I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.

931
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:45,946
亚当，它们是住进去了，但是没人出来啊！
Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!

932
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,353
噢，我的天
Oh, my.

933
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,453
能叫护士关上那扇窗吗？
Could you get a nurse to close that window?

934
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:54,496
- 为什么？ - 有烟进来
- Why? - The smoke.

935
00:58:54,563 --> 00:58:56,190
蜜蜂可不吸烟
Bees don't smoke.

936
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,190
对啊，蜜蜂可不吸烟！
Right. Bees don't smoke.

937
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:04,135
蜜蜂是不吸烟！但是有些蜜蜂却不得不吸！
Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.

938
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:06,538
对呀！我们的案子不就这么回事吗！
That's it! That's our case!

939
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,440
怎么回事？案子还没完？
It is? It's not over?

940
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,479
快起来，穿好衣服，我得去个地方
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

941
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:13,538
你回到法庭上拖延时间，能拖多久就拖多久
Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.

942
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:21,053
接着，如果你们都已经做完了第29步 那么可以让它出海了
And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub.

943
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:27,953
弗莱曼先生
Mr. Flayman.

944
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,895
是的？是的，法官大人！
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

945
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:32,661
怎么还不见你们其他的组员？
Where is the rest of your team?

946
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,101
是这样的，法官大人，说起来挺有趣
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

947
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,833
蜜蜂从小就受训应对突发事件
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

948
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,637
结果却导致我们有着很有差的时间观念
and as a result, we don't make very good time.

949
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:43,505
我听过一个非常有趣的故事，是关于…
I actually heard a funny story about...

950
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:46,013
法官大人，是不是这些荒谬的虫子们
Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs

951
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,812
已经糟蹋太多法庭的宝贵时间了？
taken up enough of this court's valuable time?

952
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:53,787
还要多久这种荒谬的恶作剧才能有个头儿？
How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?

953
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:58,316
它们一直拿不出有利的证据来支持它们的指控
They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges

954
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:02,330
我的委托人做的根本就是合法生意
against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.

955
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,330
我要求撤消全部指控！
I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!

956
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,699
弗莱曼先生，恐怕
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

957
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,171
我不得不考虑一下蒙哥马利先生的动议了
to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.

958
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,504
但是您不能这样！这是件非比寻常的案子
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

959
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,238
你的证据在哪？你的证物又在哪？
Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?

960
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:19,440
让我看看那把喷雾枪！
Show me the smoking gun!

961
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,880
等一下，法官大人！你想要看喷雾枪？
Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?

962
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,614
这就是那把喷雾枪！
Here is your smoking gun.

963
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:29,914
这是什么东西？
What is that?

964
01:00:29,992 --> 01:00:31,482
这是蜜蜂喷雾枪！
It's a bee smoker!

965
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,552
什么，这个？这个根本无害的小装置？
What, this? This harmless little contraption?

966
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:38,122
这连苍蝇都伤不了，何况一只蜜蜂
This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

967
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:46,365
尊敬的陪审员们，看看发生了什么
Look at what has happened

968
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:50,640
那些蜜蜂从来没被问过：“吸不吸烟？”
to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?"

969
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,806
难道这就是自然界对我们的本意吗？
Is this what nature intended for us?

970
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,749
被强迫受制于喷雾枪
To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines

971
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,252
还有那些人造的木质工作坊？
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

972
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,314
终其一生却只是做个蜂蜜奴隶 倒让那些白人得利？
Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?

973
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,960
- 这下我们怎么办？ - 他打的是种族牌
- What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.

974
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:13,594
女士们先生们，谢谢你们，解放这些蜜蜂吧！
Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!

975
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:16,194
解放蜜蜂！解放蜜蜂！
Free the bees! Free the bees!

976
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,433
解放蜜蜂！
Free the bees!

977
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:21,442
解放蜜蜂！解放蜜蜂！
Free the bees! Free the bees!

978
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,446
法庭宣判胜方为蜜蜂！
The court finds in favor of the bees!

979
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:26,981
维纳莎，我们赢了！
Vanessa, we won!

980
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:30,075
我就知道你做得到！来击个掌！
I knew you could do it! High-five!

981
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:31,879
噢，对不起
Sorry.

982
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,287
我没事！你知道这意味着什么吗？
I'm OK! You know what this means?

983
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:37,848
所有的蜂蜜都将归蜜蜂所有！
All the honey will finally belong to the bees.

984
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,361
从此我们再也不用成天卖命地干活了
Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.

985
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:47,628
这极不合理地颠倒了自然界的平衡，班森
This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.

986
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,364
你会后悔的
You'll regret this.

987
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:52,632
巴里，到底一共有多少蜂蜜？
Barry, how much honey is out there?

988
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,437
好好好，一个一个来
All right. One at a time.

989
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,307
巴里，你穿什么牌子的衣服？
Barry, who are you wearing?

990
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:59,108
我上身穿的是拉夫・劳伦 但是我不穿裤子
My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.

991
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:02,014
- 如果蒙哥马利说得对怎么办？ - 你这是什么意思？
- What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?

992
01:02:02,084 --> 01:02:06,214
我们按照蜜蜂的方式生活了这么久了 2700万年啊
We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.

993
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:12,318
祝贺你胜诉，你要求什么做为胜诉赔偿？
Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?

994
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:16,125
首先，我们要求彻底停止蜜蜂的人工作坊
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.

995
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,092
然后，我们会要回所有属于我们的蜂蜜
Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,

996
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,797
绝不放过任何一滴
every last drop.

997
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:27,171
我们要求终止发行那些熊罐子，它们比那些
We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more

998
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,178
污秽变味的破烂儿机器强不了多少
than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.

999
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,908
我相信，我们都知道它们在森林里的所做所为
We're all aware of what they do in the woods.

1000
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,349
等我的信号
Wait for my signal.

1001
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,481
开枪
Take him out.

1002
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:43,458
他会稍感恶心，几小时之后，他就会恢复正常
He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

1003
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,961
而且我们再也不会充许反蜜蜂类的昵称…
And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...

1004
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,963
可是这只是个娱乐性的艺名
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

1005
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,364
…不必要地将蜂蜜添加到伪劣的健康产品中
...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products

1006
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:55,098
还有那些所谓“健康”的人类喝茶用的调味料 （成份：蜂蜜）
and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.

1007
01:02:55,098 --> 01:02:56,599
还有那些所谓“养生”的人类喝茶用的调味料 （香蜂蜜）

1008
01:02:58,173 --> 01:02:59,435
没法喘气了
Can't breathe.

1009
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,172
放下来，伙计们！
Bring it in, boys!

1010
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,613
就放在那儿！好极了
Hold it right there! Good.

1011
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:10,784
开阀门
Tap it.

1012
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:19,123
巴兹威尔先生，我们刚刚装了三杯 可是那还有几百加仑正流进来
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!

1013
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:23,062
- 我想我们得把生产线关了 - 关了？我们之前从未关过
- I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.

1014
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,601
关掉蜂蜜生产线！
Shut down honey production!

1015
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,534
停止生产蜂蜜！
Stop making honey!

1016
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,532
转动钥匙，老兄！
Turn your key, sir!

1017
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,486
我们现在干些什么？
What do we do now?

1018
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,321
跳水喽！
Cannonball!

1019
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,202
我们停止了蜂蜜生产线！
We're shutting honey production!

1020
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,432
任务中止
Mission abort.

1021
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:07,998
中止传粉，停止采蜜，返回基地
Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.

1022
01:04:42,899 --> 01:04:45,999
（店内已无花）

1023
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:58,525
亚当，你肯定想不到，外面有多少蜂蜜
Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.

1024
01:04:58,594 --> 01:04:59,583
噢，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

1025
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:02,391
发生什么事了？人都哪去了？
What's going on? Where is everybody?

1026
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,656
- 他们都出去庆祝了？ - 他们都呆在家里
- Are they out celebrating? - They're home.

1027
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:08,669
他们不知道该干嘛了，出来晒太阳，回屋睡觉
They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.

1028
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:12,264
我听说你的叔叔卡尔出发去圣安东尼奥了 跟一支蟋蟀同路
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.

1029
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,831
至少我们要回了我们的蜂蜜
At least we got our honey back.

1030
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:18,107
有时我就想，人们喜欢蜂蜜，那又怎么样？ 谁不喜欢呢？
Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1031
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,048
这是世界上最值得骄傲的事！ 我很荣幸成为制作蜂蜜的一员
It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.

1032
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:28,348
这是我的新桌子，这是我的新工作 我希望把它认认真真地做好
This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.

1033
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,755
可是现在…
And now...

1034
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:32,253
现在我做不到了
Now I can't.

1035
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,373
我不明白，为什么他们都不高兴了
I don't understand why they're not happy.

1036
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,875
我们拥有这么多 我原以为他们的生活会更好的！
I thought their lives would be better!

1037
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:51,811
它们什么也不干了，太让人意外了 蜂蜜真的是改变了它们
They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.

1038
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,940
你一点也不知道到底发生什么事了，是不是？
You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?

1039
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,679
- 你想给我看些什么？ - 这个
- What did you want to show me? - This.

1040
01:05:59,688 --> 01:06:00,985
这里怎么了？
What happened here?

1041
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:03,786
这只不过是冰山一角
That is not the half of it.

1042
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,456
噢，不，噢，我的天！
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1043
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,333
它们都调谢了
They're all wilting.

1044
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,496
看起来可不是那么好，是不是？
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1045
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,903
没错
No.

1046
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:21,306
那么，你觉得这是谁的错呢？
And whose fault do you think that is?

1047
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,973
你知道，我猜可能是蜜蜂们
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1048
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,241
蜜蜂们？
Bees?

1049
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,249
事实上，是我
Specifically, me.

1050
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:32,515
我没想到蜜蜂不产蜜会影响到所有其他的事物
I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.

1051
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:37,582
不仅仅是花儿，水果，蔬菜 它们都需要蜜蜂
It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1052
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:40,526
这成了我们的学术研究实验了
That's our whole SAT test right there.

1053
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:44,157
就是说，你拿走你们的产品 却影响了整个动物界
Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.

1054
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,666
然后接着，当然了…
And then, of course...

1055
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:47,497
是人类？
The human species?

1056
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:52,764
那么，如果没有授粉的话
So if there's no more pollination,

1057
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:55,639
这么说这里将会是一片荒芜了，是不是？
it could all just go south here, couldn't it?

1058
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:59,078
我知道，这其中也有我的错
I know this is also partly my fault.

1059
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,346
来个互相残杀怎么样？
How about a suicide pact?

1060
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,944
咱们得怎么做？
How do we do it?

1061
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:10,014
- 我来蜇你，你来踩我 - 那只不过是让你死了两次而已
- I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.

1062
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:11,423
没错，没错
Right, right.

1063
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:16,361
听着，巴里…对不起了，但是我必须得走了
Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.

1064
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,199
我必须要站出来说句话了
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1065
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,541
维纳莎？
Vanessa?

1066
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,475
维纳莎？你为什么要离开？你想要去哪？
Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?

1067
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,577
去看一看最后一次玫瑰展示锦标赛 地点在帕萨迪纳
To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.

1068
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:42,590
他们把比赛调到了这一周 因为所有的花都快死了
They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.

1069
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:46,094
这是最后的机会了，以后再也看不到了
It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.

1070
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:50,621
维纳莎，我只是想说真对不起 我从没想过事情会变成这样
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.

1071
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,997
我明白，我也一样
I know. Me neither.

1072
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:58,900
玫瑰展示锦标赛，玫瑰自己没法做运动
Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.

1073
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:03,074
等一下，玫瑰，玫瑰？
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1074
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,069
玫瑰！
Roses!

1075
01:08:05,747 --> 01:08:07,578
维纳莎！
Vanessa!

1076
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,911
玫瑰？！
Roses?!

1077
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,384
巴里？
Barry?

1078
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:14,513
- 玫瑰是花啊！ - 是啊，是花啊
- Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.

1079
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,616
鲜花，蜜蜂，传粉！
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1080
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:21,026
我知道，那就是为什么这是最后一次展示了
I know. That's why this is the last parade.

1081
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:25,157
也许不是呢，你能让他开慢点吗？
Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down?

1082
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:26,825
您能开慢点吗？
Could you slow down?

1083
01:08:29,471 --> 01:08:31,063
巴里！
Barry!

1084
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:34,631
好吧，我犯了一个大错误 这是个天大的灾难，都是我的错
OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1085
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,041
是的，差不多是这样
Yes, it kind of is.

1086
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,409
我已经毁了这个星球，我本是想帮你
I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you

1087
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,812
扩展你的花店，相反，却把它搞砸了
with the flower shop. I've made it worse.

1088
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:43,316
实际上，店已经彻底关门大吉了
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1089
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,319
我还以为你是要重新装修呢
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1090
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:49,653
不过我有了个新想法，比之前的几个加起来都好
But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.

1091
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,522
我一点也不想听！
I don't want to hear it!

1092
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:56,454
好吧，他们有玫瑰，玫瑰有花粉
All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.

1093
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:59,728
我认识所有的蜜蜂 以及这个公园里的所有植物和鲜花
I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.

1094
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:03,396
我们所要做的就是把它们以前有的还给它们
All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.

1095
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,598
- 蜜蜂 - 公园
- Bees. - Park.

1096
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:05,833
- 花粉 - 鲜花
- Pollen! - Flowers.

1097
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:08,876
- 传粉！ - 贯穿整个国家！
- Repollination! - Across the nation!

1098
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,474
玫瑰锦标赛 帕萨迪纳，加利福尼亚 （玫瑰赛 展区）
Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.

1099
01:09:12,547 --> 01:09:15,539
他们什么都没有，除了花，就是彩车跟棉花糖
They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

1100
01:09:15,617 --> 01:09:16,914
安保会非常严格
Security will be tight.

1101
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:18,748
我有个主意
I have an idea.

1102
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:20,287
维纳莎・布鲁姆，国际送花会的
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1103
01:09:20,355 --> 01:09:23,017
官方花卉业务，这是真的
Official floral business. It's real.

1104
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:25,491
不好意思，女士，很靓的胸针哦
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1105
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,221
谢谢，是份礼物
Thank you. It was a gift.

1106
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:30,996
一旦入场，就只管选对彩车
Once inside, we just pick the right float.

1107
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,161
那台“公主与绿豆”怎么样？
How about The Princess and the Pea?

1108
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:37,171
我就是那个公主，你么，可以当绿豆
I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!

1109
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,501
好的，我明白了
Yes, I got it.

1110
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,606
- 对不起，我迟到了，我该坐哪？ - 你是什么？
- Where should I sit? - What are you?

1111
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,543
- 我想我就是那个绿豆 - 绿豆？
- I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?

1112
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,274
它应该是床垫下面
It goes under the mattresses.

1113
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,112
- 这个童话里会有点不同，亲爱的 - 我要去找司仪
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.

1114
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:52,176
你这样做的话整个会展就毁了
You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!

1115
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,253
让我们来看看这个家伙能干嘛
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1116
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,954
嘿，你们干嘛呢！？
Hey, what are you doing?!

1117
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:03,858
然后，我们就只管混到车流当中…
Then all we do is blend in with traffic...

1118
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,526
…不要引起人们的注意
...without arousing suspicion.

1119
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:12,139
一旦到了机场 就没人能阻挡咱们了
Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.

1120
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:13,196
停下！安检
Stop! Security.

1121
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,470
- 你和你的小昆虫还有你的彩车？ - 是的
- You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.

1122
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,069
- 它一直都是归你所有吗？ - 是的
Has it been in your possession the entire time?

1123
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:20,444
你愿意脱下鞋，拿出包里的所有东西吗？
Would you remove your shoes?

1124
01:10:20,515 --> 01:10:22,813
- 你能脱下你的蜂刺不？ - 啊，那可是我身体的一部分
- Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.

1125
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:26,081
我知道，只是开个小玩笑，旅途愉快
I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.

1126
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:36,061
接下来，如果我们够幸运的话 我们应该有足够的花粉
Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.

1127
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,033
你能想像我们有多幸运吗？ 我们有的花粉刚好够用！
Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!

1128
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,695
我猜这个能管用 （重新授粉：可行）
I think this is gonna work.

1129
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:43,863
必须得管用
It's got to work.

1130
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,567
乘客们，请注意，我是机长斯科特
Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott.

1131
01:10:46,641 --> 01:10:48,939
我们得到消息：纽约天气有变
We have a bit of bad weather in New York.

1132
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,706
看起来我们得推迟几个小时行程了
It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.

1133
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,773
巴里，这些剪下来的花儿水分不多 再拖延就用不了了
Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.

1134
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,944
我得去驾驶室跟他们说说
I gotta get up there and talk to them.

1135
01:10:58,019 --> 01:10:59,281
小心点
Be careful.

1136
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,448
可以帮我看下这本《天幕》杂志吗？
Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?

1137
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:08,018
我想要订购会说话的充气鼻子还有耳鬓修剪器
I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1138
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:14,458
机长，我是真的遇到麻烦了
Captain, I'm in a real situation.

1139
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,561
- 你刚才说什么，嗯？ - 我什么都没说
- What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.

1140
01:11:16,638 --> 01:11:18,003
有蜜蜂！
Bee!

1141
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,200
别紧张！我们整个种族…
Don't freak out! My entire species...

1142
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,811
你到底在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1143
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,579
- 等一下，我是来洽谈的 - 谁来洽谈？
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?

1144
01:11:34,656 --> 01:11:36,453
别动
Don't move.

1145
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,500
（紧急救生筏）

1146
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,085
你都干了些什么啊，巴里
Oh, Barry.

1147
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,963
下午好，乘客们，我是你们的机长
Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.

1148
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:50,437
有位叫维纳莎・布鲁姆的小姐，座位号为24B 可以过来驾驶室一趟吗？
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?

1149
01:11:50,505 --> 01:11:52,166
请马上过来！
And please hurry!

1150
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,310
这里怎么了？
What happened here?

1151
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:59,677
我试着跟他们沟通，可是那有个吸尘器 还有假发，最后弹出个充气救生艇来
There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1152
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,842
一个是秃顶，一个进了船，两个都不省人事了
One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!

1153
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,414
- 这又是一个蜜蜂笑话？ - 不是！
- Is that another bee joke? - No!

1154
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,114
没人驾驶飞机了！
No one's flying the plane!

1155
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:11,387
这里是JFK机场控制中心，356号航班 请汇报你现在的情况
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?

1156
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:14,792
我是维纳莎・布鲁姆，来自纽约的养花人
This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.

1157
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,057
怎么不见飞行员？
Where's the pilot?

1158
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:18,622
他昏倒了，还有副驾驶也一样
He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.

1159
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,931
不太妙，机上有人有飞行经验吗？
Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?

1160
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:23,630
事实上，确有一位
As a matter of fact, there is.

1161
01:12:23,705 --> 01:12:25,639
- 这位是谁？ - 巴里・班森
- Who's that? - Barry Benson.

1162
01:12:25,707 --> 01:12:28,005
就是蜜蜂大审判的那位？！噢，好极了
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

1163
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:30,636
维纳莎，这个只不过是只超大金属蜂
Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.

1164
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:32,737
它有一对大翅膀，大的引擎
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1165
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:34,111
我不会开飞机
I can't fly a plane.

1166
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,514
- 为什么不行？约翰・特拉沃尔塔也不是飞行员吧？ - 对
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.

1167
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,280
那它能有多难？
How hard could it be?

1168
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,317
等等，巴里！我们正飞向一堆闪电
Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.

1169
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:49,420
这里是鲍勃・班布 我们收到最新消息，来自JFK机场
This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1170
01:12:49,497 --> 01:12:52,330
扣人心弦的一幕正在上演
where a suspenseful scene is developing.

1171
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,096
巴里・班森，成名于他的诉讼胜利…
Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...

1172
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,330
那是巴里！
That's Barry!

1173
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:59,896
…他正努力让一驾飞机着陆 机上还载着乘客，鲜花
...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers

1174
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,205
以及失去知觉的乘务人员
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1175
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,335
鲜花？！
Flowers?!

1176
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:07,507
我们在这个区域遇到了风暴 只有两个人在驾驶飞机
We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls

1177
01:13:07,582 --> 01:13:10,312
但是根本就没有什么飞行经验
with absolutely no flight experience.

1178
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,819
稍等一下，迪奇・沃特先生 有一只蜜蜂在那驾飞机上
Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.

1179
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:17,348
我相当了解班森先生，以及他的所作所为 还有他那指望不上的伙伴
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.

1180
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:19,393
他们已经把这儿毁的差不多了
They've done enough damage.

1181
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,985
但现在他不是你唯一的希望吗？
But isn't he your only hope?

1182
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:23,860
拜托，蜜蜂根本就不该飞起来的
Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1183
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,866
它们的翅膀太小…
Their wings are too small...

1184
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:28,300
喂，等一下，这话我们不是听了上千遍了吗？
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1185
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,737
“翅膀表面积与身体质量不成比例云云”
"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."

1186
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:34,138
- 把这条线直播出去！ - 没问题
- Get this on the air! - Got it.

1187
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,006
- 各就各位 - 我们上直播了
- Stand by. - We're going live.

1188
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,880
我们工作的方法对你来说可能比较神秘
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

1189
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:43,008
制作蜂蜜要动用大量的蜜蜂 要做大量的细节工作
Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.

1190
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:45,211
但是让我来跟你讲讲什么是细节工作
But let me tell you about a small job.

1191
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,154
如果你做的好的话 结果将是大不同
If you do it well, it makes a big difference.

1192
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:51,158
远非我们所想 对于我们，对于每个人
More than we realized. To us, to everyone.

1193
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:54,718
这就是为什么我想让蜜蜂们重新开始工作
That's why I want to get bees back to working together.

1194
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:58,323
那才是蜜蜂的生活方式！我们可不是果冻做的
That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.

1195
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,231
我们要做别人的坚强后盾
We get behind a fellow.

1196
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,634
- 黑与黄！ - 在！
- Black and yellow! - Hello!

1197
01:14:06,574 --> 01:14:08,098
左，右，下，盘旋
Left, right, down, hover.

1198
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:09,734
- 盘旋？ - 忽略盘旋
- Hover? - Forget hover.

1199
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:12,371
你知道吗，这没那么难嘛 嘀-嘀！嘀-嘀！
This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1200
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:17,246
巴里，发生什么了？
Barry, what happened?!

1201
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:20,254
等等，我想我们一直处于自动驾驶状态 （自动驾驶：关闭）
Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.

1202
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,382
- 那可能是帮到了我们 - 不过现在却不是了！
- That may have been helping me. - And now we're not!

1203
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:26,052
那就是说，我还是不会开飞机
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1204
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:34,097
（警戒等级从“一些蜂”上升为“所有蜂”） 全体都有了，让我们来做他的后盾吧！出发！
All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!

1205
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,864
出发！
Move out!

1206
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:47,738
咱们唯一的机会就是我依靠本能反应 你就照搬我的动作到飞机两翼上
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!

1207
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:48,840
你用不着大声嚷嚷
Don't have to yell.

1208
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,442
我没有嚷嚷，咱们可是一直都处在大麻烦中
I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.

1209
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:55,114
我很难集中精神，都怪你那恐慌的语调！
It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!

1210
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,023
这不是什么语调，我是在惊吼！
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1211
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:10,029
我想我做不来着这个！
I can't do this!

1212
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,632
维纳莎，你要集中精神，听我说 你必须得振作起来！
Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!

1213
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:14,902
你才要振作起来
You snap out of it.

1214
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:16,068
你才要振作起来
You snap out of it.

1215
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,408
- 你才要振作起来 - 你才要振作起来
- You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!

1216
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,040
- 你才要振作起来 - 你才要振作起来
- You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!

1217
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,467
- 你才要振作起来 - 你才要振作起来
- You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!

1218
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:46,132
- 等一下！ - 怎么了？来啊，到我打了
- Hold it! - Why? Come on, it's my turn.

1219
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,334
怎么这飞机飞起来了？
How is the plane flying?

1220
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,570
我不知道
I don't know.

1221
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:51,436
喂？
Hello?

1222
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:54,505
班森，在里面玩的时候有没有鲜花啊？
Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?

1223
01:15:54,582 --> 01:15:56,015
授粉大队！
The Pollen Jocks!

1224
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,711
他们确实成了某人的后盾
They do get behind a fellow.

1225
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,220
- 黑与黄嘛 - 喂
- Black and yellow. - Hello.

1226
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:03,280
好了，让咱们来把这个铁罐子降落到柏油路上
All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.

1227
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,849
什么柏油路？哪里？ 我什么也看不见，你能吗？
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?

1228
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:08,225
不，什么都没有，全是云彩
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1229
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:10,526
加油，巴里，我们是蜜蜂
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1230
01:16:10,598 --> 01:16:12,691
- 我们是蜜蜂 - 我们是蜜蜂
- Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.

1231
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:16,066
我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1232
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:18,970
等一下，我想我感觉到了什么
Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.

1233
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,668
- 什么？ - 不知道，但是很强烈，引导着我
- What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1234
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,075
仿佛是2700万年沉淀下的本能
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1235
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:25,442
把机头向下降低
Bring the nose down.

1236
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:31,875
我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1237
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:36,049
- 什么东西跑到停机场上去了？ - 把灯光调过去！
- What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!

1238
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:39,992
我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！我们是蜜蜂！
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1239
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:42,393
- 维纳莎，对准鲜花 - 好的
- Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.

1240
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:46,594
- 关掉引擎！ - 关掉引擎？ - 咱们现在要启动蜂力马达了，准备好了么伙计们？
Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?

1241
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:47,692
已经待命！
Affirmative!

1242
01:16:50,638 --> 01:16:53,163
很好，很好，别急，就这样
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1243
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,902
降在那朵鲜花上
Land on that flower!

1244
01:16:54,976 --> 01:16:56,568
准备好了？全速倒档！
Ready? Full reverse!

1245
01:16:56,644 --> 01:16:57,804
向后转！
Spin it around!

1246
01:17:01,015 --> 01:17:03,040
- 不是那朵花！是另一朵！ - 到底哪朵？
- Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?

1247
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,484
- 那朵花 - 我正开向那朵花呢！
- That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!

1248
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:10,183
那是个肥仔穿着花花衬衫 我是指那个巨大的闪烁的鲜花
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower

1249
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:13,091
组成元素是几百万只蜜蜂！
made of millions of bees!

1250
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,153
向前拉伸，机头向下，机尾向上
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1251
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:18,492
回转过来
Rotate around it.

1252
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:22,525
- 这太疯狂了，巴里！ - 就是唯一我知道的飞行的方法
- This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.

1253
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:26,631
是我神精错乱了，还是这飞机 以类昆虫模式飞行呢？
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?

1254
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:30,109
把机头调到那，别害怕，跟着感觉，全速倒档
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!

1255
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,237
尽管降下它，就像你是它的一部分
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1256
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:34,815
对准中心
Aim for the center!

1257
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,852
现在降下它，降下它，女士！
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1258
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:49,790
好了，已经到了
Come on, already.

1259
01:17:54,602 --> 01:17:58,129
巴里，咱们成功了！你教会了我如何飞翔！
Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!

1260
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,674
- 是的，别来击掌！ - 对了
- Yes. No high-five! - Right.

1261
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,643
巴里，它管用了！你看到那个巨大的鲜花没？
Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?

1262
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:08,205
什么巨大鲜花？在哪？我当然看到 那鲜花了！那可真是杰作，伙计，杰作！
What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!

1263
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,808
- 谢谢你 - 不过这事还没完
- Thank you. - But we're not done yet.

1264
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:21,020
听着，蜜蜂们！
Listen, everyone!

1265
01:18:21,095 --> 01:18:23,996
这条飞机跑道上覆盖的是最后的花粉了
This runway is covered with the last pollen

1266
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:26,829
它们来自最后的鲜花，地球上再也没有了
from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.

1267
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:29,995
这是我们最后的机会了
That means this is our last chance.

1268
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:34,667
只有我们蜜蜂才会酿蜜，传花粉，并且穿成这样
We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1269
01:18:34,742 --> 01:18:39,304
如果我们想延续我们的种族 那现在就行动吧！你们怎么认为？
If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?

1270
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:44,613
咱们是要做回蜜蜂，还是要做博物馆里 陈列的生物链标本？
Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?

1271
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:46,244
做蜜蜂！
We're bees!

1272
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,481
做标本！
Keychain!

1273
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:51,355
那么跟我来吧！除了那个要做标本的
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1274
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,360
等一下，巴里，看这
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1275
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:54,918
这是你应得的
You've earned this.

1276
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,498
耶！
Yeah!

1277
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:11,268
我成了授粉大队的一员！挺合身嘛 就是袖子得改改
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1278
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:16,378
噢，耶
Oh, yeah.

1279
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,681
那个是我们家的巴里
That's our Barry.

1280
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,500
歌曲为披头士乐队1969年名曲《Here Comes The Sun》 此版本由Sheryl Crow翻唱

1281
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:30,020
妈妈！蜜蜂回来了！
Mom! The bees are back!

1282
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:45,672
如果有谁想要给家打个电话，快去打
If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.

1283
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,208
我感觉我们今晚要熬夜了
I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!

1284
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:07,651
找你零钱，祝你下午愉快 下一位，想买些什么？
Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?

1285
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:12,496
你还想再来点儿蜂蜜到吗？ 这是蜜蜂授权的哦，别忘了还有这些 [昆虫 法津咨询]
Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1286
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:16,901
牛奶，奶酪，干酪，都是我的 可是我没看着一个子儿
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!

1287
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:20,870
有时我觉得自己只不过是块牛肉
Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!

1288
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,204
这些我一点也不知道
I had no idea.

1289
01:21:22,276 --> 01:21:24,744
巴里，不好意思，可不可以占用几分钟？
Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?

1290
01:21:24,812 --> 01:21:28,009
请您原谅，我的蚊子助理会帮你的
Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.

1291
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:29,276
对不起我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

1292
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,476
他也是个律师？
He's a lawyer too?

1293
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:35,386
女士，我本来就是吸人血的寄生虫了 我仅需一个公文包（就成律师了）
I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.

1294
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:37,287
祝您下午愉快！
Have a great afternoon!

1295
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:41,556
巴里，我刚刚收到一份超大郁金香订单 可是我怎么也弄不到货
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.

1296

没问题，维尼，交给我就行了
No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.

1297

你就是我的救世主，巴里 下一位，需要点儿什么？
You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?

好了，紧急起飞，伙计们，该出去飞飞了
All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.

1299

谢谢你，巴里！
Thank you, Barry!

1300
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,975
噢！那只蜜蜂抢走了我的生活！
That bee is living my life!

1301
01:21:57,044 --> 01:21:58,170
顺其自然吧，肯尼 （店招：维纳莎与巴里 鲜花 蜂蜜 法律咨询）
Let it go, Kenny.

1302
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,840

Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.

1305
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,500
（不要着急关闭，演职员表最后还有几句台词^^）

1306
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,500
TLF中文字幕站 http://tlfsubs.eastgame.net

1307
01:29:42,409 --> 01:29:45,242
伙计，你得时刻想着：我们是蜜蜂
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.

1308
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:47,109
- 我们是蜜蜂！ - 说我呢？ （后面还有台词^^）
- Thinking bee! - Me?

1309
01:30:21,782 --> 01:30:24,546
等一下，给我点儿时间，等一下
Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.

1310
01:30:24,618 --> 01:30:28,213
对不起，对不起，对不起大家了 可以就在这儿停一下吗？
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?

1311
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:31,725
我不会在谢幕表演中做出生命中的重要决定！
I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!

1312
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:34,886
好了好了，休息十分钟，所有人都有了 马上闭幕，伙计们
All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.

1313
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:37,089
我实际上没排练过这段
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
