谁把我涂鸦板拿走的

-抱抱龙  你干嘛  -吓到没有? 要说实话
-How're you doin', Rex?  -Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

82
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,480
这一次 我差一点就被你吓死
I was close to being scared that time.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,920
我一直想可怕一点  但是我老是没有灵感
I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,320
我只是一个惹人厌的家伙
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,550

What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?

89
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,110

90
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,280

-大声叫出来  -好了  谢谢
-For crying out loud.  -Thank you.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,330
试音  试音  清楚吗
-Hello? Check. That better? Great.

Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great.

99
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,520
今天我们第一项议题
Okay. First item today:

100
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,860
对了  每个人都找到 搬家的伙伴了没有
Uh... oh, yeah. Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

101
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,680
-什么?  -搬家的伙伴? 他不是说真的吧
-What?  -Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

102
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,870
我不知道我们要搬家了
I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.

103
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,370
-要拉小手吗
-Do we have to hold hands?

104
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,870
你们以为 我在跟你们开玩笑
You guys think this is a big joke.

105
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,370
我们只剩下一个礼拜的时间 就要搬家了
We've only got one week left before the move.

106
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,980
我不希望任何玩具被丢下来  两个人一组
I don't want any toys left behind. A moving buddy.

107
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,800
如果还没有  去找一个来  
If you don't have one, get one!

108
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,030
好了  接下来...对了  
All right, next. Uh, oh, yes.

109
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,260
星期二晚上 我们开的塑胶老化大会
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting...

110
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,770
我认为呢  非常的成功
was, I think, a big success.

111
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,000
我们要感谢拼字先生为我们所做的一切
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,810
-谢谢你  拼字先生  -不客气
-Thank you, Mr. Spell.  -You're welcome.

113
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,260
好了  对了  还有一件小事
Okay. Uh, oh, yes. One, uh, minor note here.

114
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,280
安弟的生日派对改到今天晚上
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.

115
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,570
-等一下
-Wait a minute here!

116
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,970
什么 怎么会改成今天呢  下个礼拜才是他的生日啊
What do you mean the party's today? His birthday's not till next week!

117
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,680
是安弟的妈咪 她丢了珠宝发疯了吗
What's goin' on down there? Is his mom losin' her marbles?

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,540
很显然安弟的妈咪 希望在搬家之前开一个派对
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.

119
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,720
-我不担心 你们也不需要担心啊  
-I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried. 

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,770
-胡迪当然不担心了
 -Of course Woody ain't worried.

121
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,070
安弟从幼稚园开始 就最喜欢他了
He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten.

122
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,360
拜托  蛋头先生
Hey, hey. Come on, Potato Head.

123
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,800
如果胡迪说不用担心 那么我绝对不会担心
If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

124
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,520
胡迪以前从来没有弄错过
Woody has never steered us wrong before.

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,270
好了  各位  每年圣诞节跟生日 都得来这么一次
Come on, guys. Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.

126
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,290
但是如果安弟有了新恐龙呢 很凶的那一种
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?

127
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,320
我想我是绝对受不了 被抛弃的打击
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!

128
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,720
听着  没有人可以取代我们
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
我们讨论的重点是安弟
This is Andy we're talking about.

130
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,550
我们被安弟玩了多少次 并不重要
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.

131
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,920
重要的是  安弟需要我们的时候  我们就在他身边
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,000
那才是我们做玩具的目的  对吧
That's what we're made for, right?

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,970
对不起 我很不想打断会议  但是... 他们来了
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!

134
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,950
客人在三点钟方向
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

135
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,240
-保持冷静
-Stay calm, everyone!

136
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
嘿
Hey!

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,730
-会议结束
-Uh, meeting adjourned.

138
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,230
老天  你们看到那些礼物没有
Ho, boy! Will you take a look at all those presents?

139
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,720
我什么都看不到
I can't see a thing.

140

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,480
配线可能是铜线哦
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

276
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,600
对了  你从哪里来的  新加坡? 香港?
So, uh, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?

277
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,910
不  事实上  我是驻扎在 第四区域的珈玛象限
Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

278
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,150
我是宇宙保护小组 太空警备队的队员
As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,

279
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,970
我保护我们的星际
I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion...

280
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,980
免于受到星际联盟头号大敌邪恶皇帝查克的入侵
from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

281
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,850
是吗? 我来自儿乐宝
Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.

282
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,980
而我来自美泰儿  其实我并不是来自美泰儿
And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

283
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,970
我是来自比较小的公司 
I'm actually from a smaller company 

284
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,480
 结果被美泰儿收购了  我想...
that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

285
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,200
一群土包子  没看过新玩具
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.

286
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,810
是  你看看他  
Well, sure. Look at him. 

287
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,580
身上的小东西  比瑞士刀还要多呢
He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

288
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,290
-小心点
-Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful.

289
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,100
被我雷射击中可不是好玩的
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.

290
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,500
雷射  你怎么会没有雷射呢? 胡迪
Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody?

291
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,630
那不是雷射 那只是会闪的灯泡
It's not a laser! It's a.. It's a little light bulb that blinks.

292
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,300
-他怎么了  -嫉妒雷射
-What's with him?  -Laser envy.

293
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,280
好了  够了
All right, that's enough!

294
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,620
-我们对安弟的新玩具都印象深刻  -玩具?
-Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.  -Toy?

295
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,810
玩 具
T-O-Y. Toy!

296
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,770
对不起 我想你用的字应该是太空骑警
Excuse me, l-l think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

297
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,060
我想要用的字现在不能说 
The word I'm searching for I can't say 

298
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,250
 因为有学龄前的玩具在场
because there's preschool toys present.

299
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,710
你有点紧张了吧
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

300
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,360
巴斯先生  我很好奇
Uh, Mr. Lightyear, uh, now, I'm curious.

301
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,760
一个太空骑警都做些什么呢
What does a Space Ranger actually do?

302
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,850
他不是太空骑警
He's not a Space Ranger!

303
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,530
他不会打击邪恶  发射雷射  也不会飞 -打个岔
-He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!  -Excuse me.

304
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,650
-了不起的翅膀  了不起
-Ooh!  -Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good!

305
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,340
什么  什么嘛  这些是塑胶  他不会飞
Oh, what? What? These are plastic. He can't fly!

306
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,990
这是碳化合金  而且我的确会飞
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly.

307
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,120
-不  你不会  -会  我会
-No, you can't.  -Yes, lean.

308
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,100
-你不会  -会
-You can't.  -Can.

309
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,680
-不会  不会  不会  
-Can't. Can't. Can't!  

310
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,750
-就算我闭着眼睛 也可以飞遍整个房间
-I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!

311
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,390
-好啊  泡泡头先生  证明一下  -那好吧
-Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.  -All right, then, I will.

312
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,420
各位请退后
Stand back, everyone!

313
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,740
飞向宇宙浩瀚无垠
To infinity and beyond!

314
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,220
-我会飞
-Can!  -Whoa!

315
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,770
-你飞得可真壮观
-Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

316
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,040
-我找到搬家的伙伴了  -谢谢  谢谢你们  谢谢
-I found my movin' buddy.  -Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.

317
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,000
那不叫飞行  那只是花拳绣腿
That wasn't flying! That was... falling with style.

318
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,240
小妞们一定迷死你了 教教我好吗
Man, the dolls must really go for you. Can you teach me that?

319
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,410
刚刚那一招真是太酷了  -闭嘴
Golly bob howdy!  -Oh, shut up!

320
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,150
再过几天 
You know, in a couple of days, 

321
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,540
这里就会恢复老样子了  等着瞧吧
everything will be just the way it was. They'll see.

322
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,730
-不信你看
-They'll see.

323
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,170
我还是安弟最爱玩具
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

329
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,970
"一颗要爆发的炸弹"

330
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,410
"从此我发现  一些奇怪的事要发生"
# Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to m

331

我的帽子在哪里啊
Hey, who's got my hat?

抱抱龙  弹簧狗  给你们看样东西
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something.

363
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,930
我好像被你们给同化了
It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.

364
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,960
-你们老大安弟  把他的名字刻在我身上
-Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.  -Wow!

365
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,770
还用奇异笔耶
With permanent ink too!

366
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,680
好了  我要回去修我的船了
Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.

367
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,390
胡迪  不要让他影响到你
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

368
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,200
-你说什么  -什么意思  谁?
Uh... let what? I don't, uh- What do you mean? Who?

369
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,020
我知道安弟他很喜欢巴斯
I know Andy's excited about Buzz.

370
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,770
但是你在他的心目当中 一直占有一席之地的
But you know he'll always have a special place for you.

371
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,420
-是啊  是块畸零地  -好了  我受够了
-Yeah, like the attic.  -All right, that's it!

372
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,650
-单向的细长连结带
-Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip.

373
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,260
巴斯先生他要胶带
Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.

374
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,140
嗯?
Hmm?

375
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,890
听着  泡泡头  你最好离安弟远一点
Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy.

376
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,650
他是我的  没有人可以拆散他跟我
He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.

377
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,330
-你到底在说什么啊  我的连结带呢
-What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?

378
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,450
还有一件事  从现在开始 少再说什么太空的事
And another thing: Stop with this spaceman thing!

379
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,010
-那快把我逼疯了  
-It's getting on my nerves!  

380
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,100
-不高兴可以向星际总部申诉啊
-Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?

381
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,270
好  我看你是 敬酒不吃吃罚酒
Oh-ho, okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?

382
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,530
-警长  不要无理取闹  -是吗? 硬汉
-Don't even think about it, cowboy.  -Oh, yeah, tough guy?

383
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,580
这空气没有毒嘛
The air isn't...toxic.

384
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,440
你怎么可以在一个不知名的星球上
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!

385
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,720
打开我的头盔  我的眼球很可能被吸出去的
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!

386
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,890
你真的以为  你就是那个太空人巴斯光年吗
You actually think you're the Buzz Lightyear?

387
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,010
我一直以为你是个冒牌货
Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!

388
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,350
各位  快看  这是真的巴斯光年
Hey, guys, look! It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

389
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,330
你在讽刺我
You're mocking me, aren't you?

390
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,450
不...  巴斯  有外星人
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Buzz, look, an alien!

391
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,060
-在哪?
-Where?

392
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,410
好耶
Yes!

393
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,230
-哎呦
-Whoa!  -Uh-oh.

394
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,460
-是阿薛  -不准动
-It's Sid!  -Don't move!

395
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,310
-我还以为他去夏令营呢 
-I thought he was at summer camp. 

396
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,900
 -他一定是被踢出来了
 -They must've kicked him out early this year.

397
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,400
-不对  不是阿薛
-Oh, no, not Sid!

398
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,470
-进来了
-Incoming!

399
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,510
-这回又是谁啊
-Who is it this time?  

400
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,230
  -我...我看不清楚是谁  雷尼呢
-I...I can't...I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?

401
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,440
-我在这儿  胡迪  -不  我受不了残忍的画面
-Right here, Woody.  -Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again.

402
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,570
天哪  是战斗兵卡尔
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

403
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,760
-怎么回事啊  
-What's going on?  

404
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,950
-这不关你们太空人的事  是我们玩具自己的事
-Nothing that concerns you spacemen; just us toys.

405
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,930
最好让我看一看
I'd better take a look anyway.

406
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,580
-那个阿兵哥  为什么绑着爆炸装置
-Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?

407
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,080
因为那个...阿薛
That's why: Sid.

408
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,000
-他的毛还真多
-Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.

409
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,190
不是  那是阿德  白痴
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

410
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,800
-他才是阿薛
-That is Sid.

411
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,030
-那个天真的小孩  -他才不天真呢
-You mean that happy child?  -That ain't no happy child.

412
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,610
折磨那些玩具是他的最爱
He tortures toys, just for fun!

413
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,100
我看我们必须想个办法吧
Well, then we've got to do something.

414
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,500
你在干什么  快下来
What are you doing? Get down from there!

415

-我要给那孩子一个教训  -是啊  好  尽管去
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.  -Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,930
-用你吓人的雷射溶化他

小心  别乱碰  那是非常危险的
Be careful with that! It's extremely dangerous.

418
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,770
点火了  他点火了
He's lighting it! He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

419
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,200
-趴下
-Lookout!

420
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,150
-好耶  死了  他死了
-Yes! He's gone! He's history!

421
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,490
-我本来可以阻止他
-Whoo!  -I could've stopped him.

422
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,720
巴斯  我是很想领教你的本事
Buzz, I would love to see you try.

423
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,640
更想看看 你是怎么去当烈士
Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.

424
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,190
-真希望立刻就能搬家
-The sooner we move, the better.

425
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,890
好耶
Yeah!

426
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,980
飞向浩瀚宇宙
To infinity and beyond!

427
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,160
打包完了肚子好饿哦
All this packing makes me hungry.

428
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,790
-我们的晚餐就去...比萨星球吧 
-What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet? 

429
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,120
 -比萨星球  哦酷
 -Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

430
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,510
去洗手  我替茉莉换衣服
Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready.

431
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,530
我可以带玩具去吗 你只能带一个玩具
-Can I bring some toys?  -You can bring one toy.

432
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,850
-只能带一个啊  -一个玩具?
-Just one?  -One toy?

433
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,290
-嗯
-Hmm.

434
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,090
-安弟会选我吗
-Will Andy pick me?

435
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,720
别作梦了
"Don't count on it"?

436
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,570
嗯
Mmm!

437

巴斯  巴斯  巴斯光年
Buzz! Oh, Buzz! Buzz Lightyear.

438
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,760
巴斯光年 老天爷  我们有麻烦了
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness. We've got trouble!

439
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,580
-麻烦  在哪儿  -下面  就在下面
-Trouble? Where?  -Down there. Just down there.

440
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,290
一个无助的玩具 它被困住了
A helpless toy, it's.. it's trapped, Buzz!

441
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,090
我去看看
Then we've no time to lose.

442
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,280
-什么都没有耶  -就在那下面  再找找
-I don't see anything!  -Oh, he's there! Just, just keep looking!

443
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,770
-长什么样子...
-What kind of toy...

444
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,960
啊
Oh! Whoa, whoa! Oh!

445
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,030
-巴斯
-Buzz!

446
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,220
巴斯
Buzz!

447
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,350
他没有摔在车道上耶
I don't see him in the driveway.

448
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,570
-我猜他弹到阿薛的院子了  -巴斯
-I think he bounced into Sid's yard!  -Oh! Buzz!

449
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,950
各位  遥控车好像有话要说  什么事  老弟
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy?

450
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,390
-他是说这件事情并不是意外  -什么意思
-He's saying that this was no accident.  -What do you mean?

451
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,040
-巴斯是被推出去的  天哪  胡迪推的
-I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed... by Woody!  -No!

452
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,230
-什么  -等一下
-What?  -Wait a minute.

453
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,670
你...你不会以为我是故意把巴斯推出窗外的吧
You...You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window,

454
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,820
  是吧  蛋头
 do you? Potato Head?

455
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,950
-你该叫我蛋头先生  你这暗箭伤人的凶手
-That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbing murderer!

456
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,660
那是个意外 各位  拜托你们...
Now, it was an accident, guys. Come on.

457
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,850
你们一定要相信我
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

458
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,080
我们相信你  胡迪
We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex?

459
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,000
对吧  抱抱龙 这个...我不喜欢跟人家对质
Well, yea.. N.. I don't like confrontations!

460
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,440
你的荣誉到哪儿去了  你真的是军人的一大耻辱
Where is your honor, dirt bag? You are an absolute disgrace!

461
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,420
你根本不配对我们发号施令
You don't deserve to.. Hey!

462
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,550
受不了巴斯光年占去了你的时间 对吧  胡迪
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

463
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,140
你受不了巴斯可能成为 安弟最喜欢的玩具这件事实
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

464
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,890
所以你想要除掉他
So you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody

465
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,400
如果安弟花很多时间玩我呢  你也要把我丢到窗外吗
You gonna knock me outta the window too?

466
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,630
-我们不能让他胡作非为  -他来了
-I don't think we should give him the chance.  -There he is, men.

467
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,760
-抓住他  -用他的拉绳把他绑起来
-Frag him!  -Let's string him up by his pull string!

468
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,050
-我要他的帽子  -你们快住手好吗
-I got dibs on his hat!  -Would you boys stop it!

469
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,080
-抓住他  -不...等等...我可以解释
-Tackle him!  -No, no, no! W-W-Wait! I can explain everything!

470
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,410
-安弟  快点  -好  马上来  我要拿巴斯
Okay, Mom, be right down. I've gotta get Buzz.

471
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,010
撤退
Retreat!

472
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,960
妈咪  你有没有看到巴斯
Mom, do you know where Buzz is?

473
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,510
-没有  我没有看到
-No, I haven't seen him.  -Psst!

474
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,910
安弟  我要锁门
Andy, I'm heading out the door!

475
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,260
-但是我找不到  
-But, Mom, I can't find him! 

476
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,560
-儿子  先拿别的玩具  快走了
 -Honey, just grab some other toy. Now, come on!

477
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,470
好吧
Oh, okay.

478
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,090
我找不到巴斯  我明明放在桌上的
I couldn't find my Buzz, know I left him right there.

479
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,830
乖乖  他一定还在那儿  你会找到的
Honey, I'm sure he's around You'll find him.

480
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,900
太短了  我们还需要连环猴
It's too short! We need more monkeys!

481
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,030
已经没有了  整桶都倒光了
There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel!

482
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,370
巴斯  这些连环猴不够
Buzz, the monkeys aren't working!

483
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,440
我们会再想其他的办法的  保持冷静
We're formulating another plan! Stay calm!

484
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,030
他到底在哪里啊
Oh, where could he be?

485
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,440
-我来帮忙加油  -好啊 我还能让你开车呢
-Can I help pump the gas?  -Sure! I'll even let you drive.

486
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,630
-真的?  -对  等你十六岁
-Yeah?  -Yeah, when you're 16.

487
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,820
-真讨厌  妈咪又在骗人家
-Yuk, yuk, yuk! Funny, Mom.

488
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,700
天啊  我要怎么说服那些家伙 那只是个意外
Aw, great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?

489
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,720
巴斯
Buzz!

490
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,790
巴斯  你还活着
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

491
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,230
太棒了  我有救了  我有救了
This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

492
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,150
安弟会发现你 他会带我们两个回房间
Andy'll find you here; he'll take us back to the room;

493
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,700
然后你就可以告诉每一个人 
and then you can tell everyone that 

494
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,950
 这只是一个天大的误会了
this was all just a big mistake.

495
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,970
对吧? 伙伴
Huh? Right? Buddy?

496
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,520
我只是要让你知道 虽然你一直想要毁灭我
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me,

497
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,330
但是在我们的星球 并不鼓励我们复仇
revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.

498
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,400
-那很好  -但这里不是我的星球  对吧?
-Oh. Well, that's good.  -But we're not on my planet, are we?

499
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,790

-安弟
-Andy!

506
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,440
他不知道我不在车上吗
Wh... Doesn't he realize that I'm not there?

507
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,890
我被遗弃了
I'm lost!

508
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,630
我是个没人要的玩具
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

509
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,900
巴斯光年任务日志
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

510
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,340
警长跟我似乎在一个 很巨大的燃料补给站
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort.

511
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,980
-你...
-You!

512
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,740
-根据我的导航电脑...
-According to my nava-computer, the-  -Shut up!

513
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,460
-闭嘴  给我闭嘴  白痴 
-Just shut up, you idiot! 

514
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,180
 -警长  现在没有时间惊慌
 -Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

515
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,830
现在是惊慌的好时机  我被遗弃了  安弟走了
This is the perfect time to panic. I'm lost. Andy is gone.

516
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,340
他们再过两天就要搬家了 这全是你的错
They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!

517
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,490
我...我的错?  
My... My fault? 

518
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,460
如果你一开始 没有把我推出窗外...
If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...

519
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,550
对  如果不是你
Oh, yeah? Well, if you...

520
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,560
坐着那艘笨太空船出现 
hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship 

521
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,930
 并且抢走
and taken away everything...

522
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,120
原来属于我的东西的话...  -你不能怪到我身上
that was important to me..  -Don't talk to me about importance!

523
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,830
就是因为你使整个宇宙的安全受到危险
Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

524
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,020
什么啊  你在说什么啊

525
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,040
就是现在  查克皇帝在银河系边缘
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg...

526
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,340
秘密建立了一种武器

527
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,840
那个玩意儿  足以毁灭整个星球
with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!

528
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,010
只有我有资料  可以击破这武器唯一的弱点
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.

529
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,520
而你  朋友  就是你耽误了
And you, my friend, are responsible...

530
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,170
我跟星际总部会合的时间
for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!

531
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,500
你是个玩具
You... are... a... toy!

532
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
你不是真的巴斯光年
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear! You're a..

533
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,700
你...只是个会动的玩具  只是给小朋友玩的玩具
You're an action figure! You are a child's plaything!

534
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,390
你是个可悲又奇怪的人  我很同情你
You are a sad, strange little man; and you have my pity.

539
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,970
-你知道林荫大道在哪吗  -不知道
-Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?  -Oh. no!

540
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,210
没有巴斯我没有脸回去
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.

541
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,230
-巴斯  巴斯  快回来  -走开
-Buzz! Buzz, come back!  -Go away!

一艘太空船  巴斯
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

呃  林荫大道吗  -对  在哪条路上
Uh, Cutting Boulevard, huh?  -Yeah, yeah. Which way?

547
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,170
好  你确定这个太空运输机 送完了货物之后
Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin...

548
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,570
就会回到原来太空站吗  -嗯
once it jettisons its food supply?  -Uh-huh.

549
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,160
等到了那里以后 我们再来想个办法送你回家
And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home.

-走  那我们上船吧  -等等...巴斯
-Well, then, let's climb aboard.  -No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

551
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,830
-我们到车后面 那里不会被人发现  -不行
-Let's get in the back. No one will see us there.  -Negative.

552
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,340
货舱里没有安全设备 那是载货的
There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.

553
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,630
-在机舱里比较安全  -对  但是...
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.  -Yeah, bu..

554
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,490
-巴斯  那是两条向左的路和一条向右的
-Buzz! Buzz! That's two lefts and a right, huh?

555
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,510
-谢谢你帮忙  谢了  -记住  孩子...
-Thanks for the directions, okay?  -Yeah. And remember, kid..

556
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,630
-巴斯
-Buzz!

557
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,710
在机舱比在货舱里安全 真是白痴
It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

558
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,620

577
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,790
好棒的太空船  干得好  胡迪

妈咪  我能玩黑洞吗  拜托...
Mom, can I play Black Hole? Please, please, please?

579
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,570

等一下  来...巴斯  往这边
Wait a minute. No, no, no, Buzz! This way.

581
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,300
-那边有一艘特别的船  -它有超高动力吗
-There's a special ship. I just saw it.  -You mean it has hyperdrive?

582
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,700
超高的启动动力
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

583

597

这里谁负责
Who's in charge here?

600
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,350
是爪子
The claw!

601
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,470
-爪子是我们的主人  -爪子会选择谁留下来谁离开
-The claw is our master.  -The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.

602
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,910
-这太荒谬了  -过份  这什么烂机器嘛
-This is ludicrous.  -Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,790

619
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,010
-放手  放手  你们这些疯子
 -Do not fight the claw.

620

-You're almost home.  -Nirvana is coming. The mystic portal awaits.

624
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,500
拜托你闭嘴  你们两个根本不懂
Will you be quiet? You guys don't get it, do you?

625
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,250
只要进了阿薛家  一辈子都别想出来
Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.

626
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,860
-阿德  好乖

632
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,210
-我不知道  -不知道是什么意思
-I don't know.  -What do you mean you don't know?

633
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,510
-我不知道
-I don't know!

634
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,530
-汉娜  你看珍妮  -干嘛

以前从来没有人
No one's ever attempted a double bypass...

643
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,380
动过脑袋移植的手术
brain transplant before.

644
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,920
这种手术很困难  钳子
Now for the tricky part. Pliers!

645
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,630
我想那个家伙应该没有上过医学院吧
I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.

646
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,380
医生  你成功了
Doctor, you've done it!

647
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,450

Whatever she says, it's not true!

650
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,640
我们死定了  我要离开
We are gonna die. I'm outta here!

651
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,700
锁住了
Locked.

652
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,130
-一定还有别的出口
-There's gotta be another way outta here.

653
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,000
巴斯  是...是你吗
Uh, Buzz? W-Was that you?

654
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,480

661
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,980
星际总部收到没有
Star Command, do you copy?

662
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,590
-我的雷射枪最大威力可以杀人
-I've set my laser from stun to kill.

663
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,550
好极了  好极了 如果有人攻击的话 
Aw, great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, 

664
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,170
 我们就要他的命
we can blink 'em to death.

665
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,290
-各位  我找到他了
-Hey, you guys, I think I found him!

666
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,790
-巴斯  是你吗
-Buzz, is that you?

667
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,190
咪咪  拜托你走开好吗
Whiskers, will you get outta here!

668
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,210
-你干扰到我们的搜救任务了
-You're interfering with the search and rescue!

669
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,330
你们看  他们回来了
Look, they're home.

670
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,120
妈咪  你看到胡迪没有
Mom, have you seen Woody?

671
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,830
-你最后是把他放在哪儿啊  -就在车上啊
-Where was the last place you left him?  -Right here in the van.

672
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,270
他一定在的  只是你没好好找罢了
Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.

673
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,360
他不在车上  胡迪不见了
He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone.

674
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,860
胡迪不见了?
Woody's gone?

675
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,050
老天  那黄鼠狼逃走了
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

676
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,450
我早说他有罪
Huh? Huh? I told you he was guilty.

677
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,620
谁也没有想到  他会做出这么可怕的事情来
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?

678
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,880
弹簧狗  我希望他没事
Oh, Slink, hope he's okay.

679
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,120
有生还者  叛军的基地在哪儿  说
Oh, a survivor. Where's the rebel base? Talk!

680
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,130
你的意志很坚强嘛
I can see your will is strong.

681
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,720
不过我们有很多办法 让你开口
Well, we have ways of making you talk.

682
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,970
你的叛军朋友在哪儿
Where are your rebel friends now?

683
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,580
阿薛  你的点心好了
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

684
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,380
好耶
All right!

685
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,330
还好吗  我真以你为荣
Are you all right? I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

686
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,140
一般人被这样折磨早就说了
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.

687
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,480
希望不会留下疤痕
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

688
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,190
还是没有星际总部的消息  我们离太空站不远了
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the space port.

689
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,220
那扇门...没关  我们自由了
The door. It's open! We're free!

690
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,590
-胡迪  我们不知道外面有什么  -我会告诉你...
-Woody, we don't know what's out there!  -I'll tell you wha-

691
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,650
-他们要吃我们  巴斯  快想办法  -遮住眼睛
-They're gonna eat us, Buzz! Do something quick!  -Shield your eyes.

692

 你们不知道这里是什么样子
You don't know what it's like over here!

831
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,160
好了  没什么好看的了
Come on. Let's get outta here.

832
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,770

Go back to your lives, citizens. Show's over.

833

00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:50,690
弹簧狗
Slinky!

837
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,440
巴斯  走开
Buzz! Go away!

838
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,570
你们这些恶心的怪胎
You disgusting freaks! Aaah!

839
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,730
退后你们这些食人族 快让开  
All right, back! Back, you cannibals! Aah! Oof!

840
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,410
他还活着  你们休想吃掉他  怪物
He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!

841
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,700
你在干什么
What are you doin'?

842
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,390
他们把你修好了耶
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

843
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,300
但是...他们是食人族
But... But they're cannibals.

844
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,560
我们看到他们吃别的玩具
We saw them eat those other toys.

845
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,650
抱歉  我...我还以为你们想...
Uh, sorry, I-I-I thought that you were gonna...

846
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,260
就是吃我的朋友
You know, you know, eat my friend.

847
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,340
等等  别走
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

848
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,220
-怎么了  -阿薛?
-What's wrong?  -Sid?

849
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,680
等一下  妈  我有事
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

850
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,700
-阿薛  巴斯  快点起来  -你没关门
-Sid! Buzz, come on!  -You left that door open.

851
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:57,110
你快起来  好  等阿薛把你给拆了 可别怪我
Get up! Use your legs! Fine! Let Sid trash you, but don't blame me!

852
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,980
寄来了  终于寄来了
It came! It finally came!

853
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,220
哈哈
Ha, ha!

854
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,500
大飞弹
"The Big One."

855
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,310
本物品极度危险
"Extremely dangerous.

856
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,430
请勿让儿童触摸
Keep out of reach of children."

857
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,230
酷耶  我该炸什么呢
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

858
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,560
那个胆小的牛仔娃娃呢
Man. Hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?

859
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:41,430
好耶  我一直想发射个太空人进入太空轨道
Yes. I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.

860
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,890
-呵呵
-Heh, heh.

861
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,160
现在  好的
Now. Yes.

862
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,410
-喔  不
-Oh, no!

863
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,790
很烦耶
Oh, man!

864
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,900
阿薛报告
Sid Phillips reporting.

865
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,090
由于发射地点天候不佳
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed...

866
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:17,010
因此发射顺延
due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.

867
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,140
明天天气预报  晴天
Tomorrow's forecast: sunny.

868
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,500
祝你好梦
Sweet dreams.

869
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,020
我到处都找过了  我只找到你的帽子而已
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.

870
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,210
如果他们丢在这里呢
But what if we leave them behind?

871
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,300
别担心  
Oh, don't worry, 

872
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,730
我们明天离开以前一定会找到胡迪和巴斯的
honey. I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

873
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,920
我需要空气
I need air!

874
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,210
你别动来动去的
Why will you quit movin' around?

875
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,970
对不起  只是我在旅行之前  会非常的紧张
I'm sorry. It's just that I get.. I get so nervous before I travel.

876
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,570
我怎么会选你当搬家的伙伴
How did I get stuck with you as a moving buddy?

877
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,790
其他人都被选光了
Everyone else was picked.

878
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,380
胡迪
Oh, Woody.

879
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:13,000
如果你能看到安弟  他有多想你那就好了
If only you could see how much Andy misses you.

880
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,330
巴斯
Psst. Psst! Hey, Buzz!

881
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,430
嘿
Hey.

882
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,540
快过来帮我弄走这个工具箱
Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox off me.

883
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,290
拜托  巴斯
Oh, come on, Buzz, I...

884
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:48,670
巴斯  没有你我办不到  我需要你的帮忙
Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.

885
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:53,050
我帮不了你  我帮不了任何人
I can't help. I can't help anyone.

886
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,490
你当然可以  巴斯  你可以把我弄出去
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me outta here.

887
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:59,520
然后我替你拆掉火箭  然后我们逃回安弟家去
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

888
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,850
安弟家  阿薛家  有什么差别呢
Andy's house, Sid's house. What's the difference?

889
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,130
巴斯  你八成摔傻了 摔得脑筋都不清楚了
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.

890
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,570
不  胡迪  我的头脑第一次这么清楚
No, Woody. For the first time I am thinking clearly.

891
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,330
你说得对  我不是什么太空骑警
You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger.

892
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:18,180
我只是一个玩具  一个愚蠢微不足道的玩具
I'm just a toy, a stupid, little, insignificant toy.

893
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,170
等一下  想想看
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

894
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,980
当一个玩具  要比当什么太空骑警好多了
Bein' a toy is a lot better than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

895
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,960
-是吗  -我说真的
-Yeah, right.  -No, it is.

896
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,990
听着  在那个房子里面有个小孩 认为你是最棒的
Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest.

897
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,320
那可不是因为你是太空骑警
And it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal.

898
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:35,180
而是因为你是玩具  你是他的玩具
It's because you're a toy. You are his toy.

899
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,370
安弟为什么会想要我呢
But why would Andy want me?

900
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:41,860
安弟为什么会想要你  看看你自己  你是巴斯光年
Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

901
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,990
任何玩具 都愿意被改造成像你一样
Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.

902
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:48,740
你有飞翼  在黑暗中闪光  还会说话
You've got wings. You glow in the dark. You talk!

903
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,080
你的头盔会... 那样...那样乱转
Your helmet does that, that, that whoosh thing.

904
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,970
你是一个很酷的玩具
You are a cool toy.

905
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,190
老实说你真的是酷毙了
As a matter of fact, you're too cool.

906
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:05,530
我在想... 像我这种普通的玩具
mean, I mean, what chance does a toy like me have...

907
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,870
怎么跟你这么有名的 巴斯光年来比呢
against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?

908
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,580
我了不起只会...
All I can do is...

909
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:16,060
我的靴子里有蛇
There's a snake in my boots.

910
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,150
安弟只要有了你就够了
Why would Andy ever want to play with me...

911
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,070
怎么还会喜欢我呢
when he's got you?

912
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:26,170
被绑在火箭上的那个人  应该是我才对
I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.

913
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:51,730
算了  巴斯  不要管我了
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

914
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:55,050
趁还来得及你赶快离开吧
You should get outta here while you can.

915
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,790
巴斯  你在干什么? 我以为...
Buzz? What are you doin'? I thought you were...

916
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,920
来吧  警长  对面有个需要我们的孩子
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us.

917
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,900
让我先把你弄出来
Now let's get you out of this thing.

918
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,090
是  遵命
Yes, sir!

919
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,350
-加油  巴斯  我们办得到
-Come on, Buzz. We can do it.

920
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,660
胡迪  搬家货车到了
Woody, it's the moving van.

921
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,780
我们必须快点离开
We gotta get outta here now.

922
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,560
加油  巴斯
Come on, Buzz.

923
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,220
好耶
All right. Buzz!

924
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,340
-巴斯  我出来了  -快成功了
-Hey, I'm out!  -Almost there.

925
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,650
我要骑小马
I want to ride the pony.

926
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:54,820
胡迪
Phew. Woody?

927
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,470
胡迪  你没事吧
Woody? Are you all right?

928
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:01,380
我没事  我很好
I'm fine. I'm okay.

929
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:16,390
对了  该发射了
Oh, yeah! Time for liftoff! Whoo!

930
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,980
飞向宇宙浩瀚无垠
To infinity and beyond!

931
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:32,670
-退后...
-Aah! Back, back.

932
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:34,970
-走开  走开
-Down, down!

933
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,540
-我该怎么办  加油  胡迪  想啊
-Okay, what do I do? Come on, Woody. Think.

934
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,890
各位
Guys!

935
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,710
不...等等  不要走  听我说
No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait. Listen, please.

936
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,230
巴斯是个好玩具 
There's a good toy down there, 

937
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,780
 在过几分钟他就会被炸的粉碎
and he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.

938
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:53,430
都是因为我  我们必须救他
All because of me. We've gotta save him.

939
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,750
但是...我需要你们
And, uh.. Bull need your help.

940
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:07,820
拜托  他是我的朋友
Please. He's my friend.

941
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,720
我就只剩这么一个朋友
And he's the only one I've got.

942
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,590
谢谢  好  我知道该怎么做
Thank you. Okay, I think I know what to do.

943
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:29,190
我们要打破一些小规则
We're gonna have to break a few rules.

944
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,730
如果成功了 对我们大家都好
But if it works, it'll help everybody.

945
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,980
-休士顿呼叫管制塔 请回答

钻狗洞
Lean back!

962
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:54,980
管制塔  发射台已经完工了吗
Uh, Mission Control, is the launch pad construction complete?

963
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,690
听到了  火箭现在已接到导引线上

01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,200
我有锦囊妙计
Everything's under control.

970
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,390
-胡迪  你在干什么  -休士顿

All systems are go. Requesting permission to launch...

972
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,150

973
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:32,100
