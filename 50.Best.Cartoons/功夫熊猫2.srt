1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
很久以前 在古老的中国
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,180
孔雀王统治着宫门城
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,810
他们为城里的百姓带来了欢乐和繁荣
They brought great joy and prosperity to the city

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,310
因为他们发明烟火
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,450
但是他们的儿子 沈王爷
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,030
发现了烟火的邪恶力量
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,740
带来缤纷欢乐的烟火
What had brought colour and joy

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,290
也可以制造黑暗和毁灭
could also bring darkness and destruction.

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,250
他的双亲居心的向羊仙姑求助
Shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer.

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,720
仙姑预言，沈王爷如果继续这条黑暗之路
She foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path,

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,890
最后终将被一名黑白大侠所击败
he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,640
年轻的沈王爷决心要改变命运
The young lord set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,650
没想到这样反而走上了不归路
But what he did next only sealed it.

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,530
他满怀信心回去见双亲
Shen returned to his parents full of pride.

15
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,840
然而,他们的脸上只有恐惧
But in their faces, he saw only horror.

16
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,430
他被永远逐出城外
He was banished from the city forever.

17
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,800
所以他发誓报仇
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,810
总有一天他会回来
Someday he would return

19
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,840
让全中国臣服在他的脚下
and all of China would bow at his feet.

20
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,220
就快完成了 沈王爷 但材料用完了
lt's almost done, Lord Shen, but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,310
到各个村庄去搜刮,去找金银铜铁
Search the farthest villages! Find more metal!

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,360
中国会是我的
China will be mine.

23
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:36,840
功夫熊猫 2

24
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,700
我跟你说,神龙大侠就加入了盖世五侠
And then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five!

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,750
他们加在一起武功盖世,绚到不行
And they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever!

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,750
费话少说,开打吧
Enough talk. Let's fight!

27
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,090

-Thirty-seven! -Yeah!

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,560
他到底是怎么塞进去的?
How is he doing that with his face?

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,900
三十八个豆沙包
Thirty-eight bean buns!

35
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,610

Yes! New record! You monster!

-继续塞 四十个 -四十个不可能
-Keep going! Hit 40! -He'll never hit 40.

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,450
你说得对 伙计 我要挑战四十!
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

38

Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,410

但是当我发现问题不在于你,而在于我
But once l realised the problem was not you, but within me,

Don't worry, Shifu, l'll master inner peace as soon as l get back.

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,230
我怎么说呢?
How do l say this?

151
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,730
我是从哪来的啊?
Where did l come from?

152
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,400
是这样的 儿子 鹅宝宝都是来自小鹅蛋
Well, you see, son, baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,250
不准你问我蛋从哪儿来哦 -爹 我不是问那个啦.
-Don't ask where the egg comes from. -Dad, that's not what l meant.

154
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,630
我 我知道你不是
l know it's not.

155
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,090
不过现在也该是时候了,其实我要跟你说的早就该跟你说了
l think it's time l told you something l should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,050
你说
OK.

157
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,050
你 也可以算是我 我 我领养的
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,220
领养的
...adopted.

159
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,230
-我就知道 -你知道?
-l knew it. -You knew?

160
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,360
-是谁说的? -摆脱 少来啦 爹
-Well, who told you? -No one. l mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,370
你明知道 那你从来为什么不说呢?
But if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,410
那你为什么从来不说?
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,420
我怎么来这儿的? 爹 我从哪儿来的?
How did l get here, Dad? Where did l come from?

164
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,580
老实说 ...你从这里来的
Actually...you came from this.

165
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,340
那天跟平常没什么两样
lt was just another day at the restaurant.

166
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,140
我正打算做面条
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,430
我就先到后面去 我叫的菜全都已经送到了
l went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered.

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,310
我叫了高丽菜 大头菜 萝卜...
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

169
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,100
可是我没看到萝卜
Only there were no radishes.

170
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,690
只看到一只饿扁的熊猫宝宝
Just a very hungry baby panda.

171
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,280
篮子里没有纸条
There was no note.

172
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,490
当然了 可能是被你吃了
Of course, you could have eaten it.

173
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,660
我去看看有没有人来找你, 但是没人来
l waited for someone to come looking for you, but no one did.

174
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,650
我便带你到里面来
l brought you inside.

175
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,530
喂你
Fed you.

176
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,700
帮你洗澡
Gave you a bath.

177
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,700
然后再喂你
And fed you again.

178
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,800
再喂
And again.

179
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,680
我还想帮你穿裤子
And tried to put some pants on you.

180
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,220
接着我做出了一个改变我一生的决定
And then l made a decision that would change my life forever.

181
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,530
我决定不再用萝卜熬汤头
To make my soup without radishes.

182
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,950
还有 把你当成亲生儿子
And to raise you as my own son.

183
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,330
小阿波 我的小熊猫
Xiao Po, my little panda.

184
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,870
从那刻开始  我的面汤和人生都变得更加鲜美
And from that moment on, both my soup and my life

185
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,210
都变得更加鲜美
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,380
我的小波 故事就到此为止
And, little Po, that's the end of the story.

187
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,730
你看看我 不要看
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,390
就这样子? 不可能啊 一定还有别的 爹
That's it? That can't be it. There's gotta be more, Dad!

189
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,780
还有 就是你把我的竹椅竹桌全部都啃光光
Well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,940
嗯 全都是进口货
lt was imported, too.

191
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,290
老板 我要一个包子 神龙大侠包
One dumpling, please, Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,490
阿波 你的故事也许没有快乐的开始
Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,170
但结局很好啊
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,090
你有我 你功夫高强 你有吃不完的面条哎
You got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles.

195
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,930
我知道 我只是有好多疑问
l know. l just have so many questions.

196
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,510
像我怎么可能塞得进这个小篮子
Like how did l ever fit in this tiny basket?

197
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,350
为什么我不爱穿裤子
Why didn't l like pants?

198
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,680
我到底是谁?
And who am l?

199
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,780
好 注意
Good. Watch your form.

200
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,950
很好
Good.

201
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,330
Better. Elbow.

202
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Straighten it out!

203
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,490
沈王爷?
Shen?

204
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,620
三们大侠 你们好
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,540
客套话就不用多说了,请离开我的王宫
Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,840
-你的王宫? -没错
-Your house? -Yes.

207
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,500
你们没看到门口的孔雀吗?
Didn't you see the peacock on the front door?

208
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,630
啊  你在这啊 羊仙姑
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,970
看来你这个半仙之前的预言不怎么灵光嘛
lt seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.

210
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,140
-等着瞧 王爷  -是你等着瞧老山羊
-We shall see, Shen. -No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,860
-我们讲到哪了? -你想要做什么?
-Where were we? -What do you want, Shen?

212
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,520
-拿回属于我的一切 宫门城
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

213
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,370
宫门城隶属于长老会管辖
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council,

214
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,370
由我们负责保护 所以你别想染指
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,790
听到你这么说我好安慰啊
l'm so glad you feel that way.

216
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,800
不然我把它拖来就白费功夫了
Otherwise, l'd have dragged that here for nothing.

217
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,010
箱子里装的是什么?
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,710
你想看吗? 那是礼物
You want to see? lt's a gift.

219
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,670
献给你们的礼物, 它会让你们身首异处
lt's your parting gift, in that it will part you.

220
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,390
一块掉这 半截在那
Part of you here, part of you there

221
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,510
还有有一团飞到那,弄到墙上好脏啊
and part of you way over there, staining the wall!

222
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,680
你这大胆狂徒
You insolent fool!

223
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,210
-还行 -这只是个警告你
-Show-off. -That is a warning.

224
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,220
你的功夫根本打不过我们
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,340
我不可以
l agree.

226
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,220
但它可以
But this is.

227
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,950
你们知不知道掌管宫门城大侠?
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,450
-雷霆犀利侠哦? -没错
-Master Thundering Rhino? -Yes.

229
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,190
-飞天铁犀侠大英雄的儿子? -对
-Son of legendary Flying Rhino? -Yes.

230
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,330
他曾经在万邪谷亲手杀死过邪恶万蛇吗?
And slayer of the Ten Thousand Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,540
-他死了 -哇
-He's dead. -Whoa.

232
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,910
这怎么可能呢
That's impossible.

233
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,540
犀利侠的护身牛角可化解任何招数
Rhino's Horn Defence is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,220
他不是败给武功 沈王爷打造了一种武器
lt was no technique. Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,800
能喷出烈火射出炮弹
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:10,310
要是不去阻止他 很可能就再也没有功夫了
Unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,850
-可是我才刚上手啊! -所以你要拯救它
-But l just got kung fu! -And now you must save it.

238
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,940
去! 快去摧毁那个武器 将沈王爷绳之以法
Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!

239
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,940
好吧 出发吧
OK, here we go! Here we go!

240
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,820
不不不 等一下下 那我要怎么做呢?
Wait a second. How can l do this?

241
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,620
功夫要怎么样打败能打败功夫的东东
l mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?

242
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,700
你要记住神龙大侠 只要能平心静气
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,250
什么事都可能做得到
anything is possible when you have inner peace.

244
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,680
平心静气
lnner peace. lnner peace. lnner peace.

245
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,600
平心静气 拼了
Peace on.

246
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,810
阿波
-Oh, Po? -Peace!

247
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,100
阿波
Oh, Po, l got you a travel pack.

248
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,360
我替你收拾好了 够吃好几个礼拜 饼干包子几样小菜
l packed you food for weeks. Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,780
你的五侠公仔全放进去了 你看!
And l even packed all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,150
噢! 哈哈哈 哦哎哟 我不知道那是什么 我这辈子从没看过
l don't know what those are. Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,200
爹 你把我的捍娇虎刮花了
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,240
我也放了咱们爷俩快乐时光的画像
l also packed your paintings of our best time together,

253
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,960
以免你觉得寂寞 呵呵
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,960
这是我们一起做面条. 这是我们一起吃面条
That's me and you making noodles. And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,540
这是我背着你玩骑马打仗 呵呵
And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.

256
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,970
我还是把这张留下来好了
That cute? On second thought, l'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,010
嘿 他们都在等我 -知道 知道
-Hey, they're waiting for me. -Of course, of course.

258
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,350
你身负重任 远离家乡
You have a job to do...far from home,

259
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,230
陌生城市 人生地不熟的 面条的味道也怪
in a strange city, filled with strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,150
面对可怕的危险 可能会有去无回!
facing horrible danger from which you might never return!

261
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,900
-别走 阿波! -我一定得走了
-Don't go, Po! -l gotta go.

262
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,360
我是神龙大侠 我的使命就是要拯救功夫
l'm the Dragon Warrior. lt's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,490
如果我不去的话 那我会是什么?
And if l don't...what am l?

264
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,120
我的儿子啊 对吧
You're my son.

265
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,910
对吧?
Right?

266
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,340
-阿波 该走了  -我走了
-Po, it's time. -Goodbye.

267
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,840
鹅阿爹 您放心
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,390
"面条"两个字还没说完 他就会回来了
He'll be back before you can say ''noodles''.

269
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,100
面条
Noodles.

270
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,370

爹? 娘? 是你们吗?
Mom? Dad? ls that you?

276
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,680
爹! 娘!
Mom! Dad!

277
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,940
哦嗨 嘿 嘿 儿子 回来了
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,400
儿子 你怎么在这里干什么?
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,610
-我还以为...
But l thought...

280
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,700
-我们把你换掉了 换来这个可爱的萝卜
We replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish.

281
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,910
-萝卜? -他安静 有礼貌 说真的
-Radish? -lt's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,960
功夫也比你厉害
does better kung fu.

283
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,340
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,420
不要
Wait!

285
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,680
No.

286
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,910
萝卜 萝卜 萝卜...搞什么
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,290
平心静
lnner pea...

288
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,170
平...
Pea...

289
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,210
平心静气

哦 呃 我在练功
l'm...training.

292
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,790
桅杆不算可敬的对手
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,840
-我准备好了 -好吧
-l am ready. -OK.

294
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,010
好严肃哦
So serious.

295
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,810
我看我还是打船杆好了
l think l prefer the mast.

296
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,690
是我不好 我以前都是利用皇宫旁的铁木桩来练功
Apologies. l used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,190
已经没有感觉了
Now l feel nothing.

298
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,240
真是酷到破表
That's severely cool.

299
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,200
再来
Again!

300
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,120
那么 你用铁木桩练功 总共练了多少年
So, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that?

301
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,050
-二十年了 -哦 二十 二十年啦
-Twenty years. -Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,210
有没有快一点的方法?
ls there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,090
可以马上让我变到没有感觉啊
You know, until you, you know, don't feel anything?

304
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,220
没有 不过...
No. Besides...

305
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,230
我觉得硬功不是你的专长
...l don't think hard style is your thing.

306
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,360
阿波 你到底出来做什么?
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,070
我刚发现我爹他不是我亲生的爹
l just found out that my dad isn't really my dad.

308
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,960
你爹? 就那只鹅
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,830
我想你一定吓了一大跳
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,380
对啊
Yeah.

311
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,920
-所以你心情不好? -你在开玩笑?
-And this bothers you? -Are you kidding me?

312
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,100
我们可是大侠哎 拥有钢铁意志
We're warriors, right? Nerves of steel.

313
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,230
白金般毅力
Souls of platinum.

314
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,590
像你
Like you.

315
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,730
你是强者完全没感觉
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,280
-我只是...-你们两在哈聊什么啊?
-l was...-So, what are you guys talking about?

317
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,940
没啦 没啦
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,240
阿波跟他爹有心结
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,530
我幸运真好 我跟我爹完全没心结
l'm so lucky. l don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,080
我还没出生,我爹的头就被娘咬掉了
Maybe it's because Mom ate his head before l was born.

321
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,090
快螳螂 又不是在说你
-l don't know. -Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,290
阿波他现在心情很糟
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,620
-我没有很糟 -阿波
-l'm not freaking out. -Po.

324
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,010
-我现在很嗨  -阿宝
-l'm freaking in. -Po!

325
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,850
-什么? -我们到了
-What? -We're here.

326
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,970
宫门城
Gongmen City.

327
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,870
我父王的宝座
My father's throne.

328
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,080
他以前常让我在旁边玩耍
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,750
向我保证 将来王位会是我的
promising someday, this throne would be mine.

330
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,880
往左边挪一点
A little to the left.

331
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,180
哦 可是这很重哎
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

332
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,640
我等了三十年 就等这一刻
Thirty years l've waited for this moment.

333
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,310
每一样东西都要完全符合我的想像
Everything must be exactly how l envisioned it.

334
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,180
我想像这个再左边一点
And l envisioned it a little to the left.

335
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,390
完美
Perfect!

336
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,780
这件武器就在我的...再往过去一点
With the weapon by my si...A little bit more.

337
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:34,710
这件武器在我身边全中国都会臣服于我
With the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me.

338
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,540
我们三天后出发
We move out in three days,

339
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,540
在那月圆之日 潮涨之刻
when the moon is full and the tide is high.

340
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,340
老山羊 不如你替我算一算我的...
Now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my...

341
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,550
命运?
Fortune?

342
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,430
未来 我要说的是未来
Future. l was going to say future.

343
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,980
看一下你的碗 说说我未来的荣耀
Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,230
你若是再一意孤行下去
lf you continue on your current path...

345
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,570
就会发现自己最后在楼梯底下
...you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,080
我看见...
l see...

347
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,870
我看见...
l see...

348
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,080
我看见痛苦 还有愤怒
l see pain...and anger.

349
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,260
好大的胆子! 这是全省最好的丝绸
How dare you! That is the finest silk in the province!

350
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,460
而且还会耍赖
Followed by denial.

351
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,260
这根本不叫算命 你只是说出现在发生的...
This is not fortune-telling. You're just saying

352
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,430
事?
-what's happening right...-Now?

353
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,770
最重要的时刻就是现在
The most important time is now.

354
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,430
如果你真的想预见未来的话...
But if you really want to see the future...

355
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,980
你看到什么?
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,740
一只孔雀...
A peacock...

357
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,120
被一名黑白大侠打的落花流水
...is defeated by a warrior of black and white.

358
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,330
完全没有改变
Nothing has changed.

359
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,430
不可能的事 你很清楚
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,810
这并不是不可能的事 他也清楚
lt is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,260
谁?
Who?

362
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,440
-沈王爷 有一只熊猫 -熊猫?
-Lord Shen! l saw a panda! -A panda?

363
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,990
他是一个功夫高手 张牙舞爪像恶魔
A kung fu warrior. lt fought like a demon!

364
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,780
大只毛又多
Big and furry.

365
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,120
柔棉棉好好摸 肥都都的好可爱
Soft and squishy. Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,910
这世上熊猫已经绝种了
There are no more pandas.

367
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,420
他眼睛虽然不好都还能看清事实
Even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth.

368
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,460
为什么你就是看不清呢?
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,510
找到这只熊猫 然后带他来见我
Find this panda and bring him to me!

370
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,420
遵命
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,430
怎么 这这么一只熊猫也不能证明你是对的
One panda lives. That does not make you right.

372
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,440
说的对 你迟早会知道我是对的
You're right. Being right makes me right.

373
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,980
那我就杀了他 证明你错了
Then l will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,980
拜托你不要再啃了!
Will you stop that!

375
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,260
那一定是沈王爷的宫殿就在城的另一头
That must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city.

376
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,970
太好了 让我们冲进高塔大喊 我们是神龙大侠和盖世五侠
Great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim,

377
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,180
我们是神龙大侠和盖世五侠
''We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five,

378
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,340
我们要来把你绳之于法
and we are here to bring you to justice''!

379
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,440
你在干嘛? 这地方到处都是恶狼
What are you doing? This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,520
嘿 不就是那个家伙锤扁你的脸吗
Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face?

381
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,570
我不喜欢那个家伙...
l do not like that guy.

382
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,370
我们得摸进高塔 而且千万不能被恶狼发现
We need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,040
我了 神出鬼没
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,700
-Get out of the way! -Foiled again.

385
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,540
Now, where'd those noodles go?

386
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,270
哎呦...

387
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,870
你好吖 呵呵呵呵 我...
Hello. l couldn't help but...

388
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,960
好了 够了 我在干嘛?
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was l?

389
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,130
-阿波到哪去了? -我们怎么会搞丢一个胖子?
-Where's Po? -How can we lose a guy that big?

390
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,050
OK.

391
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,560
各位 各位?
Guys! Guys?

392
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,440
-阿波...-哦 对不起
-Hey, Po. -What? Sorry.

393
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,110
那也叫神出鬼没 啊?
So that was stealth mode, huh?

394
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,740
说真的啦 这个并不是我的强项
To be honest, not one of my stronger modes.

395
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,320
你还有更多的金子呢 给我
...gold in there, come on!

396
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,940
这米还是生的
This rice is raw!

397
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,660
你们抢走我所有的厨具呀
You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen!

398
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,000
要是你不帮我煮饭,那我就煮了你
Either you cook my rice, or l cook you!

399
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,920
--啊对不起...-阿波 快去帮她
-My apologies, but...-Po, do something.

400
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,580
那我该怎么帮她煮饭又不会被逮到?
How am l supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught?

401
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,800
等等 我有更好的办法
-Wait, l have a better idea. -...two...

402
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,170
-一...
...one.

403
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,970
-嘿? 嘿?
-Hey. -Hey.

404
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,690
我们来解救百姓 把沈王爷绳之以法
We're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.

405
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,570
-你会需要帮忙 -谢谢你 勇敢的羊
-You will need help. -Thank you, brave sheep,

406
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,200
但是太危险了 不能让你帮...
but it's too dangerous. l can't let you.

407
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,540
哦 不是我啦 这里说话不安全
Oh, no, not me. lt's not safe to speak here.

408
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,170
-好
Right.

409
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,040
我说的是铁牛侠跟流星鳄
l'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

410
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,580
他们被关在黑龙巷里的宫门大牢
They're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley.

411
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,380
什么? 他们还活着?
What? They're still alive?

412
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,550
他们两位大侠一定是去牢里收集情报 
They must be in that jail gathering intelligence,

413
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,430
筹划怎么用超赞武功打败那个武器
hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

414
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,260
好 我们走
OK, let's go!

415
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,520
-谢了 羊MM -再见 -嘿! 快点拦下那玩意儿!
-Thanks, sheep. -Hey! Stop that costume!

416
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,970
不要动
-Hold it right there! -Get them!

417
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,390
呃...抱歉!
-Get them! -Sorry!

418
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,730
看招!
Take that!

419
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,480
这边走! 快一点!
-Keep going! -Faster!

420
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,560
Hey, stop!

421
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,760
-Look out! Watch it! -Sorry!

422
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,010
Surround him.

423
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,930
好
Now!

424
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,850
逮到了...
Gotcha!

425
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,150
嗯? 他们跑哪去了?
What? Where'd he go?

426
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,110
-分头搜! 给我到处搜! -这里要不要搜?
-Spread out! Search everywhere! -What about over there?

427
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,230
-难道"那里"不算到处吗 -哦...算吧
-ls ''there'' a part of ''everywhere''? -l...l guess.

428
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,870
还不快搜!
Then search there!

429
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,290
他们肯定很近 因为我的后背忽然感到一阵冰冰凉
They must be close. l can feel a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

430
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
抱歉 阿波 是我啦!
Sorry, Po. lt's just me.

431
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,630
你们看! 宫门大牢!
Look. Gongmen Jail.

432
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,060

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,520
好Q? 嗯?
Cute, huh?

434
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,360
漂亮 阿波
Nice work, Po.

435
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,450
只要有个风吹草动 我就会这样 嘎嘎...叽叽!
At the first sign of trouble, l'll give you a signal.

436
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,790
-像灵鹤那样哦? -对 不好意思!
-You mean like Crane does? -Yeah.

437
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,330
不好意思 我的声音哪有那么难听啊?
Excuse me, when have l ever made that noise?

438
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,460
铁牛侠! 大侠...
Master Ox! Master!

439
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,170
流星鳄大侠!
The ferocious Master Croc!

440
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,510
嘿...跟风暴铁牛侠!
And Master Storming Ox.

441
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,340
我不敢相信 我们在营救功夫界的传奇人物
l can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu.

442
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,510
我们会把你们救出去的 没问题的 这附近肯一定有钥匙
We're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem.

443
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,310
不对 他们不可能会乱放的
Gotta be a key around here. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.

444
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,570
喔 赞...你找到了! 来吧各位 耶!
Oh, good! You found it. Come on, you guys! Yeah!

445
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,730
我们来找你了 老沈!
We're coming for you, Shen!

446
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,450
两位 你们来不来啊 你们想待会再来会合吗?
Guys, are we going or not? Do you want to meet us there later?

447
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,370
我想你们也想夺回宫门城 对吧?
l mean, you do want to take back your city, right?

448
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,250
你说的没错
Of course we do.

449
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,250
可能反抗沈王爷 他一定会炸掉宫门城!
But if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city.

450
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,220
有听没有懂 你们要保护宫门城
Listen to yourself. You're protecting Gongmen City

451
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,180
所以才不保护宫门城哦?
by not protecting Gongmen City?

452
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,970
-只要我们手牵手心连心...-他就会用武器杀死所有居民
-lf we all fight together...-Then the weapon would kill everyone.

453
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,890
哦 是哦? 那我们用...偷袭的!
Oh, would it? Then we use...a sneak attack!

454
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,640
-偷偷进去 然后...-然后你们就会被挡住!
-We get inside and then...-And then you will be stopped...

455
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,400
被挡不住的武器挡住
...by the unstoppable weapon.

456
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,900
世界上没有什么是我挡不住的 我告诉你
Nothing's unstoppable except for me when l'm stopping you

457
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,570
不要告诉我有什么是挡不住的
from telling me something's unstoppable!

458
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,800
铁牛侠 我不能让你继续待在牢里!
Master Ox, l'm not letting you stay in this cell.

459
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,840
我看你怎么让我出去!
l'd like to see you get me out!

460
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,810
你们看到没? 这一招真的超赞!
You guys see that? lt's called being awesome.

461
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,850
拜托 你们不当英雄哦?
Come on! Whatever happened to being heroes?

462
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,780
在宫门城当英雄只有死路一条
The only hero in this town is a dead one!

463
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,070
我说过 你休想把我给弄出这里!
Like l said, you are not getting me out of this cell!

464
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,540
哦 赞了!
Yes!

465
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,700
好 我们走!
All right, let's go!

466
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,790
我要睡上铺
l get the top bunk.

467
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,130
你就认输吧 熊猫 功夫死了!
lt's time to surrender, panda. Kung fu is dead.

468
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,800
我...
l...

469
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,010
你...你...
You...

470
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,350
功夫死了..好!
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

471
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,970
你们就抱着恐惧待在失望的大牢里
You stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness.

472
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,350
三餐拿丢人献眼配饭吃好了
And all you get are three square meals a day of shame!

473
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,150
再拿绝望当甜点
With despair for dessert.

474
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,490
我们去对付老沈 证明给内心渴望正义和荣誉的老百姓看!
We'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry

475
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,570
"因为功夫永远不会死"
for justice and honour that kung fu still lives!

476
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,120
好耶!
Yeah!

477
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,370
猴王!
Monkey?!

478
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,250
嘎嘎! 你...是我的!
You! You're mine!

479
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,380
我告诉你 什么是你的
l'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

480
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,470
我的铁拳会打烂你那软趴趴的嘴脸 啊哦!
My fist in your plush, cuddly, super-soft face!

481
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,510
快追!
Get him!

482
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,770
-快带我出去!
-Get me out of here! -Yes, sir!

483
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,980
-拦住他! -耶!
Stop him!

484
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,260
快一点!
Faster!

485
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,860
阿波走 快!
Yeah! Go, go!

486
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,530
-甩掉他! -遵命!
-Lose him! -Yes, sir!

487
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,530
抓好!
-Viper! -Hang on!

488
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,720
小心咯!
-What? -Watch out!

489
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,380
非常不酷!
Uncool! Very uncool!

490
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,480
这些 送你!
Try this!

491
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,890
各位 各位
Guys, guys, guys!

492
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,730
再小一点的
Maybe something smaller!

493
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,410
噢 不!
No, no! Oh, no, no.

494
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,710
你们最好快点从我脸上爬下来! 不好意思! 不好意思
Cute bunnies, off the face. Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

495
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,050
火哦! 着火了!
Fire!

496
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,260
追丢了
We've lost them.

497
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,230
哇哦! 再来一次!
Again! Again!

498
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,610
灵鹤 接住!
Crane, catch!

499
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,110
Gotcha!

500
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,410
各位 各位...推我一把!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!

501
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,130
快螳螂 上!
Mantis, now!

502
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:10,400
你就这么点料我感觉像在跟一坨软棉棉的云打架!?
ls that all you got? lt feels like l'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

503
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,810
我这头也准备要打雷了!
Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!

504
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,150
轮到你!
Your turn!

505
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,820
怎么会有...这么...多...招牌?
Why...are...there...so...many...signs?!

506
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,970
给我过来! 我就喜欢压死你!
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

507
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,640
好耶! 吃败仗吧
Yes! Taste the defeat!

508
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,190
让我告诉你啊...
Let me tell you something.

509
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,360
下次想要惹熊猫最好多料几个...
Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole a...

510
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,960
你八成没听说
Guess nobody told you,

511
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,050
惹毛一匹狼下场会很惨
if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs.

512
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,420
这是第二拳...你现在想怎么样?
l've hit you twice. What are you going to do now?

513
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,260
我们投降!
We surrender!

514
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:22,020
你可以铐住我的身体 确永远铐不住我的...一身傲骨
You can chain my body, but you will never chain my...warrior spirit.

515
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,680
-嘿 别忘了这个小家伙! -你又叫我...
-Hey, don't forget the little guy. -Did you just call...?

516
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,030
-阿波 你在干嘛? -相信我 我有计划...哇!
-Po, what are you doing? -Trust me. l got a pl...

517
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,580
天啊不会吧! 居然用奇门八穴手拷!
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

518
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,000
当年铐住残豹也是用这一种 超动铐的越紧...
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung. The more you move, the tighter they get.

519
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,910
这是最赞的手铐 哇...
These are the best cuffs!

520
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,090
你好啊 熊猫 见到你了 终于
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

521
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,300
哦 不 不 不...
No, no, no...

522
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,600
是终于见到你啦! 对!没错!
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

523
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,260
你好啊 熊猫 终于...
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

524
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,520
-你会害怕也是正常的 -我不害怕
-You are afraid for a reason. -l am not afraid.

525
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,450
他铐着手铐来见我
He is coming to me in chains.

526
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,110
-要说有谁该怕? 也是...-你!
-lf anyone should be afraid, it's...-You.

527
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,610
你连想都不要想
Don't even think about it.

528
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,730
我拜托你有点长进
l hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach

529
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,220
上次吞生米喝热水煮饭的那一招实在很逊
by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water.

530
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,470
这计划跟那个计划不一样
This plan's nothing like that plan.

531
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,770
-什么? -这个计划会成功的!
-How? -'Cause this one's going to work.

532
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,320
继续走
Keep moving.

533
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,580
哇...我的死对头!
Ah, my old enemy...

534
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,170
是楼梯!
...stairs.

535
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,710
多谢你背我上最后那几个楼梯
Thanks for carrying me those last few flights. OK.

536
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,290
哦对了,我刚才在三楼吐了几口
l threw up a little bit on the third floor.

537
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,880
最好找人去抹一下
Someone might want to clean that up.

538
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,730
这里有没有邪恶的打扫阿姨啊?
ls there some sort of evil janitor or something?

539
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,470
你好 熊猫
Greetings, panda.

540
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,970
-终于见...-嘿 你好吗?
-We meet at...-Hey, how you doing?

541
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,100
嘿...
Hey.

542
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,280
你长的比我想的还要大只
You've grown up bigger than l thought.

543
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,150
嘿 我有点 够了哦 不要毛手毛脚的
Hey...enough with the poking around.

544
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,080
既强壮 又健康
Strong. Healthy.

545
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,910
哎 我又不认识你 让开一点大叔
Look, l don't know who you are, but please stand aside, sir.

546
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,540
-她是女的! -哦...不好意思啊!
-That's a lady. -Oh! Sorry.

547
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,420
胡子很唬人啦 我都骗到了 干嘛骗人啊
The beard threw me. lt's kind of misleading.

548
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,670
-不要在那鬼扯蛋
-False advertising. -Enough of this nonsense!

549
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,500
把犯人押上来
Bring the prisoners to me.

550
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,300
不好意思啊 大婶 各位
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

551
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,010
所有人的眼睛全都盯着...武器!
Keep your eyes peeled for the...weapon!

552
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,640
马字飞踢!
Sparrow kick!

553
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,860
成功了!我用用功夫K掉它,你们看到没有 我就这样
We did it! l just kung fu-ed it! Did you guys see that? l was all like...

554
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,290
哈~~ 你真的相信他是那个会打败我的家伙?
Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?

555
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,630
不止相信 我知道!他就是
l do not. l know he is.

556
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,370
看看他! 想报仇想了一辈子
Oh, look at him. A lifetime to plot his revenge

557
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,050
-结果却跪在我面前 -什么? 你说一辈子...
-and he comes to me on his knees. -What? A lifetime?

558
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,470
喔! 我并没有花一辈子
l did not have a lifetime.

559
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,600
我们是几天前才听说雷霆犀利侠的事
We only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago,

560
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,480
-所以才来替他报仇! -难道你就没有别的仇要报了吗?
-and we came to avenge him! -You've come to avenge nothing else?

561
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,140
哦有哇 你抢走了大家的锅碗瓢盆
Well, yeah. All the pots and pans that you stole.

562
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,720
-我要全都拿回来 -还有没有其它的?
-l'm gonna want those back. -Nothing else?

563
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,480
我想你们还做了一堆有的没的坏事
You probably did some other evil stuff along the way. l don't know.

564
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,780
-我不知道你还做了什么哦? -你不知道吗?
-What else did you do? -You don't know?

565
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,190
知道什么? 你在笑什么?
Know what? What's so funny?

566
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,490
我在笑你原来你还不知道
The very thing that you clearly do not know!

567
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,580
够了 不要再打哑迷! 一次把话说清楚好不好?
OK, enough of these riddles! Would you guys spill the beans?

568
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,090
我们进来一看呢 这个武器好很小 骗你的
First, we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

569
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,260
它超大.然后这边这个大婶.我以为他是大叔.他有胡...
And then the lady over here, l think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

570
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,130
你到现在还能够活着
The only reason you are still alive

571
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:38,100
是因为我觉得你这个蠢才 挺有意思的
is that l find your stupidity mildly amusing.

572
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,600
谢了 可是我觉得你 邪恶的超级固人怨
Well, thank you. But l find your evilness extremely annoying.

573
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,650
你以为你是谁啊 熊猫?
Who do you think you are, panda?

574
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,520
你以为我是谁啊 孔雀?
Who do you think l am, peacock?

575
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,280
我们在笑什么啊?
Why are we laughing?

576
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,500
瞄准
Take aim.

577
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,590
开炮!
Fire.

578
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,440
哎 快 快把它点燃
Well, light the...thing!

579
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,230
我点了!
l did!

580
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,860
虫虫入侵了!
Fear the bug!

581
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,380
快抢武器!
Get the weapon!

582
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,250
悍娇虎!
Tigress!

583
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,500
-你...你也在
You...You were there.

584
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,630
-对 我也在那里!
Yes. Yes, l was.

00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,640
-你竟然让沈王爷跑了 -至少 我们毁了武器啊
-You just let Shen get away! -At least we destroyed the weapon.

586
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,690
开炮!
Fire!

587
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,480
哦...错! 他还有很多存货 喔!
Oh. No, he's got way more.

588
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,210
-我的翅膀! -阿波 快!
-My wing! -Help, Po!

589
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,790
-来了!
Coming!

590
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,080
-阿波! -小心!
-Watch out! -Po!

591
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,250
-拉我上去! -不用 放他下去
-Help me up! -No. Get him down.

592
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,970
用那条绳子
Use the ropes.

593
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,930
跑哇 跑哇 小熊猫!
Run, run, little panda!

594
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,290
-阿波 拜托! 你必须专心一点 -我行 我可以!
-Po, come on. We need you to focus! -l got it, l got it!

595
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,080
轰掉他!
Bring it down!

596
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,840
-被困住了! -走这边
-We're trapped! -This way!

597
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,720
再会!
Goodbye!

598
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,100
放箭!
Fire!

599
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,970
回去!
Get back!

600
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,030
只有往上爬才出得去
The only way out is up.

601
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,150
什么?
What?

602
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,630
跟我来! 来呀!
Follow me! Come on!

603
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,550
他们要去哪里呀?
Where are they going?

604
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,560
-上塔顶! -快点 快点爬!
-To the top! -Come on! Keep going!

605
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,360
我们来了!
Here we go!

606
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,380
-你这蠢材! -我的鼻子!
-You idiot! -My nose!

607
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,960
召集恶狼军...总体出动! 我要他们立刻做好准备!
Call in the wolves! All of them! l want them ready to move!

608
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,760
孔雀年 就从现在开始!
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

609
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,810
现在? 可是一年都过了一半
Right now? 'Cause it's the middle of the year,

610
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,650
这么算你的孔雀年只剩下半年
so you'd only get like a half of the Year of the Peacock.

611
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,560
没关系 就当今年是孔雀年好了
And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock.

612
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,730
新年快乐
Happy New Year, sir.

613
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,830

This way.

00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,360
快走!
Let's go.

619
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,620
哦...你!
Oh, you!

620
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,030
你搞什么啊? 上面一团乱
What did you do? lt's chaos up there.

621
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,870
你不是要阻止沈王爷吗?
What happened to stopping Shen?

622
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,960
对啊
Yeah.

623
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,540
别这样嘛 要对我有信心啊
Guys, come on. Give me a little credit.

624
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,840
我是故意放走他的啦
l meant for him to get away.

625
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,970
因为...这是陷阱 是圈套!
'Cause...it was a trick. lt was a plot.

626
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:17,050
我是想 嗯 搞清楚他有什么阴谋...
l was thinking...l'll figure out his plot more.

627
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,730
有听没有懂
That makes no sense.

628
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,560
什么意思? 这也不懂?
What do you mean? Sure it does.

629
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,070
阿波 说实话! 你逮到他了 怎么回事?
Po, the truth. You had Shen. What happened?

630
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,280
你在说什么啦? 什么啦 我听不懂你在说什么?
What are you talking about? l don't know what you're talking about.

631
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,990
对! 呃...好啦,我没注意到他嘛
l...Yeah...OK, he caught me off guard.

632
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,950
说实话!
The truth.

633
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:39,080
好! 他们会让你远离危险
Fine. They will keep you far from danger.

634
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,800
-非常远  -什么?
-Real far. -What?

635
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,090
你要留在这里
You're staying here.

636
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,000
啊...等一下! 我得回去
Wait! l have to go ba...

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,220
你要留在这里
You're staying here!

638
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,930
可是我要去 你不能阻止我!
l'm going. And you can't stop me.

639
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,480
好吧 刚才我还没准备好
OK. l wasn't ready that time.

640
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,370
两位 不要!
Guys? Don't.

641
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,610
来吧!
Ready.

642

你看!
Look!

643
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,220
你不要起来
Stay down.

644
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,930
-我一定要去找他 -给我一个理由!
-l have to get to him. -Then tell me why!

645
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,640
当时他也在,好吗?
He was there! OK?

646
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,020
我最后一次看到爹娘的时候 孔雀也在场
The peacock was there the last time l saw my parents.

647
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,810
他知道发生了什么事 我从什么地方来
He knows what happened. Where l came from.

648
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,440
我是谁
Who l am.

649
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,120
我一定要去
Look, l'm going.

650
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,160
我要知道
l have to know.

651
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,370
你这种强者是不会了的
The hard core can't understand.

652
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,250
悍娇虎! 不要!
Tigress, no!

653
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,420
是强者也能了解
The hard core do understand.

654
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,760
但是我不能让朋友去送死
But l can't watch my friend be killed.

655
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,270
-我们走吧! -嘿 让我去送死就没差哦?
-We're going. -Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

656
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,360
-别这么胆小
-Stop being a wimp. -And she's back.

657
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,190
别想太多
-No. -Don't worry, kid.

658
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,160
你呆在这里比较
You're better off here.

659
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,210
你错了 羊仙姑  我们今晚将航向胜利
You were wrong, Soothsayer. We sail to victory tonight.

660
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,380
你那个神奇熊猫根本是笨蛋
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

661
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:38,510
你真的确定笨的是那只熊猫吗?
Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool?

662
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,050
你刚刚才把自己的王宫给毁了
You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen.

663
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:46,570
那根本不算什么 因为全中国都将属于我
A trivial sacrifice...when all of China is my reward.

664
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,190
然后你就心满意足了吗?
Then will you finally be satisfied?

665
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,570
全世界向你俯首称臣 你的心情就会好起来?
Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?

666
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,110
嗯 刚开始嘛 也许我会把地下室改建成地牢
lt's a start. l might also convert the basement into a dungeon.

667
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,750
你的欲望永远得不到满足
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.

668
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,920
快上这种疯狂的行为吧
lt is time to stop this madness.

669
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,870
我为什么要停止啊?
Why on earth would l do that?

670
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,260
为了让你的双亲安息
So your parents can rest in peace.

671
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,050
我的双亲痛恨我
My parents hated me.

672
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,140
你明不明白?
Do you understand?

673
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:25,690
他们对不起我...我..我要改变这一切
They wronged me...and l will make it right.

674
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,140
他们爱你
They loved you.

675
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:32,060
就因为太爱你 在把你送走之后才会抑郁而终
They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.

676
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:40,450
过去的事就不要再提了 我要创造我自己的未来
The dead exist in the past...and l must tend to the future.

677
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,340
把羊仙姑放了吧 她没有用处了
Set the soothsayer free. She's no use to me.

678
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:53,130
我走了 希望你得到幸福
Goodbye, Shen. l wish you happiness.

679
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,010
幸福要靠自己夺取!
Happiness must be taken.

680
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,020
而我势在必得
And l will take mine.

681
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,670
动作快点!
-Hurry it up! -Move it!

682
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,920
要是这些武器全送出去 中国会沦陷
lf all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall.

683
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,390
-那我们就把这里弄跨 -嘿 大伙 这样行不行
-We bring down the building. -Hey, guys. How about this?

684
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,180
-噢! 一定行! -那好 我们走吧
-This will work! -All right, let's go.

685
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,850
我的脸麻掉了
l can't feel my face.

686
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,290
什么嘛...哪有孔雀年这回事
Did you hear him call it Year of the Peacock?

687
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,710
-嘿 -嘿
-Hey. -Hey.

688
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,420
不要怕 不要怕
OK. So, keep it cool. Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

689
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,000
你! 你要去哪?
You! Where are you going?

690
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,550
站起来! 正经一点 不要在那里傻笑
On your feet! And wipe those stupid grins off your faces.

691
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,780
快 废物 快! 快点! 搬上船!
Move, you dogs! Faster, faster! Load them all!

692
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,080
哈哈 你好啊 熊猫
Greetings, panda.

693
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,680
-快说那晚是怎么回事 -哪一晚啊?
-Tell me what happened that night. -What night?

694
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,850
-那一晚! -哦 那一晚
-That night. -Ah, that night.

695
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,020
没错! 我们说的是同一个晚对吧?
Yes! We're talking about the same night, right?

696
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,730
对 我是在那里 没错 我看见你的爹娘抛弃你
Yes, l was there. Yes. l watched as your parents abandoned you.

697
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,480
真是惨绝人寰 当时的情况就像这样!
lt's a terrible thing. l believe it went something like this.

698
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,090
贺岁大礼来啦!
Here's your New Year's gift.

699
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,410
最好是喜欢,因为不能退货 哈哈
Hope you like it, 'cause you can't return it.

700
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,670
阿波? 他在这里干嘛?
Po? What's he doing here?

701
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,840
退货! 退货!
Return it! Return it!

702
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,440
你真的死也要知道真相?
Are you willing to die to find the truth?

703
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,200
那还用说啊! 如果可以不要死最好
You bet l am. Although l'd prefer not to.

704
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,690
交给我们! 走!
We got them. Go!

705
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,920
你在找我吗?
You looking for me?

706
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,720
呃 我说的太早了对吧?
l said that too soon, didn't l?

707
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,310
阿波!
Po!

708
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,620
阿宝 离他远一点
Po, get away from him.

709
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,740
上的去,没问题
l'll get up. Here we go.

710
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,210
-不要再逃了 老沈! -说的也是
-No more running, Shen. -So it seems.

711
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,370
快 告诉我
Now...answers.

712
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,300
你真的这么想知道啊
Oh, you want to know so badly.

713
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,130
知道了就能解脱吗?
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

714
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,350
以弥补心灵的缺憾
Fill some crater in your soul?

715
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,670
好 你就告诉你真相
Well, here's your answer.

716
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,940
你的爹娘根本就不爱你
Your parents didn't love you.

717
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,850
让我...
But here...

718
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,690
帮你解脱吧
...let me heal you!

719
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,490
-不! -呦..!
No!

720
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,570
喂 不要想逼我喝下 啊...
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

721
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:59,080
我如果要害你 就会留你在河里自生自灭
lf l wanted you dead, l would have left you in that river.

722
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,210
-你干嘛救我? -为了要让你完成你的使命
-Well, why save me? -So you can fulfil your destiny.

723
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:06,590
你说什么东东? 这是哪里啊?
What are you talking about? Where am l?

724
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,440
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

725
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,600
真没想到你居然不记得了
l'm surprised you remember so little.

726
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,230
不过那时你年纪还小
But you were so little when it happened.

727
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,070
看来你还记得
Perhaps you do remember.

728
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,240
这只是个讨厌的恶梦
What? lt's just a stupid nightmare.

729
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,490
是噩梦? 还是记忆?
Nightmare? Or memory?

730
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,070
这里以前很热闹
This was a thriving village.

731
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,780
沈王爷是宫门城的继承人
Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.

732
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,790
可是他野心太大
But he wanted more.

733
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,720
我预言未来有人会出手阻止他 一只熊猫
l foretold that someone would stand in his way. A panda.

734
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:19,840
可是确万万没有想到会发生那种事
But l never could have foretold what came next.

735
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,440
全杀光
Get them all!

736
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:44,490
带走儿子快点逃走! 走!
Take our son and run away! Go!

737
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:01,680
不要抗拒 敞开心胸
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

738
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,700
你的故事也许没有快乐的开始
Your story may not have such a happy beginning,

739
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:12,990
但那不能决定你是什么人
but that doesn't make you who you are.

740
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,700
而是你接下来所做的选择
lt is the rest of your story.

741
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:18,700
要成为什么样的人
Who you choose to be.

742
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,240
那么 熊猫你是谁
So, who are you, panda?

743
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,920
我是阿波
l am Po.

744
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,680
我需要一顶帽子
And l'm gonna need a hat.

745
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:20,070
好难过好伤心的表情
Such sad, sad faces.

746
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,950
现在是欢乐的时刻
But now is a time only for joy.

747
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,160
你们将要看到的场表很壮观
You are going to be part of something beautiful.

748
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:33,420
等我们一到港口 一起面对全世界
Once we reach the harbour, in front of all the world,

749
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,750
你们和珍贵的功夫会一起死 呵呵
you and your precious kung fu will die.

750
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:44,840
到时中国将会臣服于我
Then China will know to bow before me.

751
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,680
出发!
Set sail!

752
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,360
那是什么东西呀
What is that?

753
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,020
老实说我没想过会这么早死
Honestly, guys, l never thought l'd die like this.

754
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,190
我还以为会遇到个MM订下来
l always thought l'd meet a nice girl and settle down and...

755
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,100
然后让她吃掉我的头
...then she'd eat my head.

756
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,680
-好衰啊 -不能放弃希望
-So sad. -We cannot give up hope.

757
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:35,400
阿波也不希望我们放弃,我们是强者! 对吧 悍娇虎?
Po would want us to remain strong. Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

758
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,330
-王爷 那座桥怎么办? -什么都挡不住我
-Lord Shen, what about the bridge? -Nothing stands in my way.

759
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,250
开炮!
Fire!

760
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,340
你这个胆小鬼!
You coward!

761
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,360
阿波?
Po?

762
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,820
阿波?
Po?

763
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:22,040
我到底要杀几次才杀得死这只臭熊猫?
How many times do l have to kill the same stinking panda?

764
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,050
老沈!
Shen!

765
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:37,270
有只熊猫会阻止你和你的野心!
A panda stands between you and your destiny.

766
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,010
什么?
What?

767
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:43,190
束手就擒,我要将你绳之以法
Prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice.

768
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,020
你的恐怖统治要完蛋了
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

769
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:48,440
-什么? -现在...拯救五侠!
-What? -And now, free the Five!

770
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,690
血滴子来了!
Disc of Destruction!

771
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,710
真是够了 瞄准!
OK. Take aim!

772
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,650
-预备? -这里...那里...
Ready?

773
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,540
你打不到我
You can't follow me.

774
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,790
快轰他!
Just get him!

775
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,840

-Yeah. Here we go. -Come on!

-Catch of Freedom! -Monkey!

783
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,510
挺不错的 神龙大侠 你的计划呢?
lmpressive, Dragon Warrior. What's your plan?

784
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,840
-第一步 拯救五侠 -那第二步呢?
-Step one, free the Five. -What's step two?

785
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,760
老实说 我也没想到第一步会成功
Honestly, l didn't think l'd make it this far.

786
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:31,970
阿波!

787
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:34,270
来找沈王爷不让他去港口
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

他们把炮手打倒了! 他们逼近了!
They're taking out our gunners, sir. They're getting close.

01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,600
你 你是怎么...
How did you...?

820
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,650
怎么做到的?
How did you do it?

821
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:53,110
就是抬起手肘 肩膀要放松
You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose.

822
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,450
不对 你怎么能平心静气?
Not that. How did you find peace?

823
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,280
我夺走你的爹娘 你的一切
l took away your parents. Everything.

824
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,830
我让你伤痕累累
l scarred you for life.

825
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:06,960
呃 可是你要知道 伤疤会好
See, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.

826
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:11,130
不 你错了 是伤口会好
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

827
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,710
噢 对 那伤疤呢? 会不见了 对吧?
Oh, yeah. What do scars do? They fade, l guess?

828
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:18,300
-我不在乎伤疤会怎样 -你必须要在乎
-l don't care what scars do. -You should, Shen.

829
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,390
你必须忘记过去所有的伤痛 因为那些并不重要
You gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

830
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,060
现在真正重要的是 你想当一个什么样的人
The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.

831
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,650
你说得对
You're right.

832
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,190
我就想...这样!
Then l choose...this!

833
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,210
你还挺强的嘛
That was pretty hard-core.

834
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,640
阿波
-Po! -You did it!

835
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,900
-过来! -以后别再这样了 拜托
-Come here! Yeah! -Don't ever do that again, please.

836
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:43,730
看来你领悟了平心静气
lt seems you have found inner peace.

837
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,230
可说是少年有成
And at such a young age.

838
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,280
因为我的师父很高杆
Well, l had a pretty good teacher.

839
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:12,930
什么叫他不在? 今天是我儿子的生日
What do you mean he's not here? lt's my son's birthday.

840
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,480
他一心一意想见到神龙大侠
All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.

841
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,400
那帮你儿子做个豆腐生日蛋糕怎么样啊?
How about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh?

842
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:21,400
算了 我们改天有空再来好了
You know, l think we'll just try again another time.

843
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:22,950
他什么时候会回来?
When do you think he'll be back?

844
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,910
不知道 拜托? 我不知道! 也许他不回来了
l don't know. OK, l don't know. Maybe never.

845
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,420
我也很担心好吗? 天下父母心 我是他爹
l mean, l worry, OK? But that's my job, l'm his dad.

846
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:35,790
起码我也养过他
At least, l was his dad.

847
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,580
他为什么要去救中国 我知道原因了
Why did he have to go and save China? l know why.

848
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,460
何必呢? 他只不过是一只小熊猫
But why? He's just one little panda.

849
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:02,770
儿子 结果怎么样? 你救了中国没?
So, how did it go? Did you save China?

850
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,160
救了
Yep.

851
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,620
我就知道
Well, l knew you would.

852
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,530
我请人做了新招牌
That's why l had new signs made.

853
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,950
我儿子救国 你救荷包
''My son saved China. You, too, can save.

854
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:14,620
来买包子 买一送一!
Buy one dumpling, get one free.''

855
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,170
嘿 爹你真聪明
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

856
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,010
-你要不要吃一个? -等一下再吃
-Would you like to try one? -Maybe later.

857
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:23,880
我有事要跟你说
There's something l should tell you.

858
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:31,100
我离开之后,找到了我出生的村子
While l was gone, l found the village where l was born.

859

也知道我为什么会放在那个萝卜篮里
l found out how l ended up in that radish basket.

860
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,990

01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:42,740
-我知道我是谁 -真的?
-l know who l am. -You do?

862
