这是鱼吃鱼的世界 你不去吃,就会被吃
it's a fish-eat-fish world. You either take or you get taken.

148
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,020
[winces]

149
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,960
有些事不必明说我也懂 就这样吧? 说完了吧?
Truer words have never been spoken. ls that it? We done?

150
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,360
现在,你和我,咱们俩共事很久很久了
Now, you and me, we worked together a long, long, long time.

151
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,870
拜托,唐・李诺,这和工作不一样
Please, Don Lino, it's hardly been like work.

152
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,900
- 你知道... - 我最欣赏你这一点
- You know... - l love that about you.

153
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,960
让我说完... 我一生都为了我两个儿子
Let me finish. That l've lived my life for my sons.

154
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,740
- 抚养他们,保护他们 - 你是最好的父亲!
- Raising and protecting them... - You're the best!

155
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,710
我说得对吧? 我说得对还是错? 是对的吧?
He's the best, right? Am l right or am l wrong? Am l right?

156
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,770
- 我总是教他们... - 对吧?
- lt's all been to prepare... - Right?

157
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,250
- 总是教他们... - 抱歉
- ...to prepare them... - Sorry.

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,020
...让他们将来能够继承我礁镇的事业 这一天终于到了
...for the day they run the reef. Well, today is that day.

159
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,720
- [sighs] - [record scratches]

160
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,990
- [sighs] - [record scratches]

161
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,050
路卡
Luca.

162
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,100
# 我喜欢大屁股,我不能撒谎 #
I like big butts And I cannot lie

163
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,720
# 你的另一些兄弟… #
You other brothers...

164
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,100
老板...大屁股...呵呵
Hey, boss. Big Butts. [chuckles]

165
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,100
蠢!
Oi vey!

166
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,870
长话短说吧... 今天开始,法兰奇和蓝尼说了算,懂吧
Long story short, from now on you work for Frankie and Lenny.

167
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,880
- 明白吗?
- Capiche? - [Sykes laughs]

168
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,400
蓝尼? 法兰奇还差不多 蓝尼? 你一定是开玩笑吧
Lenny? Frankie, l understand. But Lenny? You can't be serious.

169
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,450
我说真的,经营事业不是光靠骼膊
l'm dead serious. lt takes more than muscle to run things.

170
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,390
蓝尼有头脑,这点可是很特别的
Now Lenny, he's got the brains. That's somethin' special.

171
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,860
- 对呀,他很特别没错 - 你什么意思?
- He's special all right. - What does that mean?

172
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,660
- 没什么,我只是说… - 我叫你过来
- Nothing. l'm just sayin'... - l bring you in here,

173
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,960
当着面跟你说事情 然后,居然你说啥来着?
look you in the eye, tell you what's what, and what?

174
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,970
- 啥? - 什么啥?
- What? - What ''what''?

175
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,560
是你先说啥的
You said ''what'' first.

176
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,600
我没先说,我是问你,你说啥?
l didn't say what, l asked you what.

177
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,800
不. 你说,然后啥,我才问啥
You said ''And then, what?'' l said ''What?''

178
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,670
不,我说什么啥,到底是啥什么?
No, l said ''what what'', like what what?

179
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,070
- 你的确先说啥 - 你在嘲笑我?
- You said ''what'' first. - Now you're making fun of me?

180
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,670
不不不,你误会了
No, you misunderstood.

181
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,820
对不起,爸,我们迟了 蓝尼发生了意外,他"意外"出生了,呵呵
Sorry we're late, Pop. Lenny had an accident. He was born.

182
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,440
对不起,爸,我们迟了 蓝尼发生了意外,他"意外"出生了,呵呵
Sorry we're late, Pop. Lenny had an accident. He was born.

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,880
哼哼,你真是个搞笑天才
[sarcastic laugh] You're a comic genius.

184
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,790
我的意思是,那孩子成不了杀手
Look, all l'm saying is the kid ain't exactly no killer.

185
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,230
蓝尼是个杀手,你给我听清楚没有? 一个冷血杀手,看看他
My Lenny is a killer. You hear me? A cold-blooded killer. Look at him.

186
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,460
嗯?
Huh?

187
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,140
够了! 够了!你出局了
That's it! That's it! You are out!

188
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,400
啥? 我出局是啥意思?
What? [high-pitched] Whaddya mean l'm ''out?''

189
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,440
- 你被炒鱿鱼了
- You're fired. - [Sykes screams]

190
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,840
另外,你还得开始付钱给我
And on top of that, you're gonna have to start payin' me.

191
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,110
为啥?
For what?

192
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,810
你的小鲸鱼洗车店的保护费
So nothing happens to your little Whale Wash.

193
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,980
欢迎来奥斯卡的小窝
[Oscar] Welcome to Oscar's crib.

194
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,360
满是60寸高粘浆的舌头,口溃疡,蛀牙
60-foot slime-covered tongue with canker sores, swim-in cavities,

195
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,790

and plankton-encrusted teeth for when l feel a bit... [grunts]

196
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,850
过气
old school.

197
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,160
别抱怨啦,奥斯卡 这还不算太糟糕
Stop your moaning, Oscar. lt could be a lot worse, you know.

198
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,140
没错,这捞什子工作还好 看起来像你就更糟啦
That's true. l could have this job and look like you. [laughs]

199
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,140
谁在我后面? 谁在我后面? 来击个掌
Who's behind me? Whoever's behind me better give me some.

200
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,830
[rumbling]

201
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,610
消化不良,她要吐啦!
lndigestion. She's gonna blow!

[laughs]

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,340
- 你以为还会更糟糕吗? - 对呀...还好我没像你一样
- Still think it could be worse? - Yeah. l could look like you.

208
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,860

[whale moans]

210
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,380
肥皂弄进眼睛了! 肥皂弄进眼睛了!
Soap in the eye! Soap in the eye!

Hey, what's up, man? Man, it's good to see y'all... Huh?

各位,我得到那儿去
Fellas, l'm gonna go ahead over there.

222
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,210
# 别担心... #

# 虽然日子不顺利 #
[beatbox] About a thing

# 琐事烦恼都会过去 #
'Cause every little thing Is gonna be all right...

225
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,320
唱啥都没用
That's not the way you sing that song, mon.

226
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,530
[shrieks]

227
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,270
赛斯...我异父异母的兄弟 你好呀,宝贝?

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,710
告诉我今天好吗?
Show me dat. What's goin' down?

229
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,740
嘿,宝贝,今天是个好日子 来击个掌...击掌
Hey, baby, this is all gravy today. Now snap your fin... Snap it.

230
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,810
- 怎么不击? - 奥斯卡
- You're not snappin' it... - Oscar.

231
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,480
别紧张,很多白鱼像你一样不会击掌
Hey, don't sweat it. A lot of white fish can't do it.

232
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,990
- 你就坐下吧, 好吗? - 谢谢
- Would you just sit down, okay? - Thank you.

233
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,250
我把帐本都看了一下 你欠我五千元
l've been goin' over my markers. You're into me for five grand.

Oh, yeah? See if this refreshes your memory.

236
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,130
哇...不得了...瞧瞧
That's crazy, look at that.

237
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,070
你把一切都写下来,才不会忘记
You wrote everything down so you wouldn't forget.

238
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,170
这就是为什么你是老板我是伙计
This a perfect example of why you're in management, and l'm not.

239
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,230
干的好
You go, boy.

240
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,150
我现在得付唐・李诺保护费 你欠我就等于欠他
l have to pay Don Lino protection, so everything you owe me, you owe him.

241
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,910
- 这怎么算的? - 简单...食物链
- How you figure that? - Simple. The food chain.

242
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,480
瞧...最上面是唐・李诺 下面是我,再下来就是一般的鱼
See, on top there's Don Lino. There's me, and there's regular fish.

243
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,110
- 那是我 -不是
- That's me. - No.

244
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,090
这是浮游生物, 这是单细胞生物...
There's plankton, there's amoebas...

245
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,250
- 然...后...就是我? - 马上就到你了
- Then there's me? - l'm gettin' there.

246
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,790
这是珊瑚, 这是岩石,这是鲸鱼粪, 然后就是你
There's coral, there's rocks, there's whale pooh, and then there's you.

247
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,490
这太糟了
That's messed up.

248
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,200
所以如果唐压榨我就等于是压榨你
So if Don Lino's squeezin' me, he's squeezin' you.

249
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,170
- 什么? - 奥斯卡
- What? - Oscar.

250
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,300
对不起
Sorry.

251
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,970
- 别生气,老板,去找乐子吧 - 去找乐子吧
- Easy, boss, find your happy place. - Happy place.

252
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,340
有他在,哪儿有乐子可找! 我可是说正经的
There is no happy place with him here. [high-pitched] l'm serious.

253
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,910
好好好...求求你... 再多给我点时间
Okay, please. Please, just gimme some time.

254
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,550
就这点小要求 我求求你,塞斯,求求你
That's all l'm asking. l'm begging you, Sykes. Please. Please.

255
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,950
好吧
All right.

256
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,390
因为我欣赏你 我给你24小时来付清
'Cause l like you, l'm gonna give you 24 hours to pay up.

257
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,660
所有这些? 我怎么付法呀?
All of it? How am l supposed to do that?

258
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,500
那是你的问题 明天把五千拿去赛马场给我,否则...
That's your problem. Bring my 5,000 clams to the track tomorrow, or else.

259
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,300
- 否则如何? - 我手下会解释给你听
- Or else what? - The boys'll explain.

260
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,360
[both laugh]

261
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,560
不好受
- [sizzling] - [Oscar] Unpleasant.

262
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,930
五千元?
[Angie] 5,000 clams?

263
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,340
你欠赛斯先生五千元?
You borrowed 5,000 clams from Mr. Sykes?

264
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,340
奥斯卡,你怎么会搞成这样?
Oscar, why do you get yourself into these situations?

265
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,240
我也不知道,安姬
l don't know, Ang.

266
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,340
只是日子不好过呀 我只是个大池塘里的一条小鱼
lt's just hard, all right, because l'm a little fish in a big pond.

267
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,350
很大很大的池塘 海洋
A really big pond. The ocean.

268
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,690
我只是个无名小卒 我要那些
l'm a nobody. l want some of that.

269
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,860
- 桑切斯太太? - 啥?
- Mrs. Sanchez? - What?

270
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,960
# 女人的夜晚 # # 噢,多美妙的夜晚… #
It's ladies' night, Oh, what a night...

271
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,300
呃...不是啦 那个
Ew. No. That.

272
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,360
礁顶 大人物住的地方
The top of the reef. Where the somebodies live.

273
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,070
我想发财,成名,像他们一样 但是...我却困在下面
l wanna be rich and famous like them, but l'm stuck down here.

274
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,580
下面这儿怎么啦?
Well, what's wrong with down here?

275
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,980
我告诉你下面有什么不对
l'll tell you what's wrong with down here.

276
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,220
还记得我爸吗? 他一辈子都在洗车店打工
Remember my dad? He worked at the Wash his whole life.

277
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,720
# 哦…孩子... #
Ooh, child...

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,890
他是刷舌的头号人物
[Oscar] He was the number one tongue scrubber.

279
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,360
每年都是...连续25年
Every year for 25 years.

280
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,430
对我来说,再洗车是海里最酷的工作
To me, working at the Wash was the coolest job in the ocean.

281
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,110
然后发生了一件 我一辈子都不会忘记的事
But then I learned something I will never forget.

282
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,580
奥斯卡的爸爸是刷舌工,哈哈哈!

283
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,880
刷舌工! 刷舌工!

284
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,080
刷舌工! 刷舌工! 刷舌工! 刷舌工!
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

285
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
我爸最伟大
My dad was the greatest.

286
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,390
但是,没人会喜欢无名小卒
But nobody loves a nobody.

287
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,060
我想成为大人物
l want to be a somebody.

288
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,800
奥斯卡,你也不一定要 住到礁顶才算个大人物
Oscar , you don't have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody.

289
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,310
[grunts]

290
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,140
有什么用?如果明天我付不出钱...
What's the difference? lf l don't pay Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow,...

291
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,150
反正一死,所以...
l'm dead anyway, so...

292
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,870
等一下
Wait here.

293

这是什么?
What's this?

294
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,330
- 粉珍珠? - 嗯
- A pink pearl? - Mm-hm.

295
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,200
哪儿来的?
Where'd you get that?

296
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,260
我祖母给我的
My grandmother gave it to me.

297
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,210
她说从一粒小沙子开始...
She said it started from a tiny grain of sand,

298
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,620
但是过些日子,就会长成美丽的东西
but then, after a while, it grew into something beautiful.

299
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,860
梦想也从小处开始
Dreams can begin small too.

300
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,320
- 不...不...我不能 - 拿去吧
- No. No, l couldn't... - Take it.

301
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,590
这够你还给赛斯的钱
lt'll get you the money you need for Mr. Sykes.

302
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,460
什么意思,你还不懂吗? 我们都说过一千次了
What do you mean, you don't understand? We've been over it 1 ,000 times.

303
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,530
我不想再说一次
l don't want to have to say it again.

304
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,980
你让我很不舒服 我不知道还能怎么说
You're really giving me agita. l don't know how else to say this.

305
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,410
你出去觅食宰了猎物,然后吃了他,就这么简单 谢谢
You see something, you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks.

306
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,350
这就是鲨鱼该做的事 是个优良的传统
That's what sharks do. That's a fine tradition.

307
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,410
你是怎么啦?你哥哥法兰克...是个杀手
What's the matter with you? Your brother Frankie, here, he's a killer.

- 谢谢老爸 - 他手脚利落
- Thanks, Pop. - He's beautiful.

309

他会做该做的事 把嘴擦干净
He does what he's supposed to do. Wipe your face.

310
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,650
但是你...我听说了
But you... l'm hearin' things.

311
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,830
你要明白,如果你懦弱,会让人误认我也软弱
You gotta understand, when you look weak it makes me look weak.

312
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,130
- 我不允许这样 - 我知道,爸,对不起
- l can't have that. - l know, Pop, l'm sorry.

313
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,270
蓝尼,蓝尼,看着我 看着我
Lenny. Lenny. Look at me. Look at me.

314
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,640
这移交的事业是给你,给你们两个
This handin' over the business, it's for you, for both of yous,

315
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,310
你却表现得好像不在乎
and you're acting like you don't even want it.

316
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,310
我必须确认你能胜任
l need to know that you can handle that.

317
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,720
[sighs]

318
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,310
[splutters]

319
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,260
好吧,在我面前,现在,把他吃了

320
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,960
哦...啊...谢谢...老爸
- [whimpers] - Yeah. Gee, thanks, Pop.

321
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,430
跟你说
Here's the thing.

322
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,940
我在节食,我读了一篇关于虾子的文章 他们不利于健康
l'm on a diet. l read an article about these shrimps. They're not good for ya.

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
你不知道虾子的热量有多高
You know how many calories are in one of those shrimps?

很高
A lot.

325
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,510
没错 没错. 还有...
lt's true. lt's true and the other thing is,

326
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,810
我妹刚生了娃娃 她过世了,只好由我扶养
my sister had a baby and l took it over because she passed away

327
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,910
不幸娃娃的双腿断了
and then the baby lost its legs and its arms

328
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,720
现在已经残废了 不过在我和我太太的悉心照顾下
and now it's nothing but a stump but l still take care of it with my wife

329
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,230
他渐渐长大,也很快乐
and it's growing and it's fairly happy,

330
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,130
但是我们的情况很困难 我得打两份工才能养家
but it's difficult 'cause l've been working a second shift at the factory

331
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,190
to put food on the table,

332
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,330
但当我看着娃娃脸上的充满了爱 那一切都值得了
but all the love l see in that little guy's face makes it worth it in the end.

333
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,500
真实的故事

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,750
- 不要,发发慈悲吧 - 老爸,拜.
- No. Have mercy. - Pop, please...

337
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,080

Frankie, l want you to take Lenny out, show him the ropes.

- Come on, Pop. - You're gonna learn how to be a shark.

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,100
- 坐稳了,看赛马 - 用你那只好眼睛
- Sit tight and watch the race. - With your good eye.

421
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,540
哈哈...一只好眼睛
[Ernie] Good eye.

422
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,840
赛马就位,他们跑起来了!
[announcer] The horses are at the post. And they're off!

423
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,470
炸鱼条, 然后是海饼干和沙门氏

424
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,610
幸运日似乎出不了闸
Lucky Day seems to be having trouble getting out of the gate.

425
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,150
-  啥? - 只有蠢蛋才赌那匹马
- What? - Only a sucker would bet on that horse.

426
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,250
别紧张 他每次都这样,只是装的
Don't sweat it. He does this all the time. He's playin'.

427
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,120
怎么回事...幸运儿撞出闸
What's this? Lucky Day is now crashing his way through the gate,

428
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,860
现在他加入战局
and he's off and running.

429
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,520
海饼干,炸鱼条...
Seabiscuit, Fish Fingers...

430
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,530
拜托,幸运日,快跑
Please, Lucky Day. Go fast.

431
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,640
过第一道弯,海饼干落后 幸运日却远远殿后
Coming around the turn it's Seabiscuit by a length and Lucky Day well behind.

432
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,370
幸运日加快速度
And here comes Lucky Day,

433
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,400
从后面追上来超过黄尾和沙门氏
coming up from behind, passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.

434
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,610
你瞧?谁才是你的幸运儿,快呀!

最后一圈 幸运日来了
Around the final turn, here comes Lucky Day.

436
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,580
幸运儿追上炸鱼条了
Lucky Day's now caught up to Fish Fingers.

437
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,780
双方不相上下 幸运日领先
They're head to head. Neck to neck. Lucky Day's ahead.

438
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,020
想想待会儿咱们怎么算钞票,我就觉得累啊
l'm tired just thinkin' about countin' all of this money.

439
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,390
- 看幸运日跑呀 -  我们要
- Look at Lucky Day go. -  We're movin' on up

440

难以置信! 今天是幸运日的大日子
[Commentator] Absolutely amazing! This looks to be Lucky Day's big day.

443
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,430
[thud]

444

怎么啦? 幸运日摔倒了
What happened? Lucky Day is down.

445
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,240
我们要住进...东区

447
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,880
[rumbling, loud thud]

448
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,190
炸鱼条过来了,紧跟着的是海饼干,黄尾巴
Here's Fish Fingers, followed by Seabiscuit, Yellow Tail...

449
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,320
- 炸鱼条赢了 - 等等,我只是想抱着你
- And Fish Fingers wins. - Wait. l just want to hold you.

450
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,760
不, 放手 让我看看,好吗?
No, Get outta my way. Let me see, will ya?

451
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,800
赛斯,别忘了找乐子的地方
Remember your ''happy place'', Sykes.

452
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,500
难怪大家叫他大赌注
That's why they call him a long shot.

453
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,040
你,简直疯了,对吧? 谁会想到?
Yo, that was crazy, right? Who knew?

454
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,470
我们刚说好,只是个小意外 发财了,一切就绪...
Everything's set, it's a lock, we good to go, we in the money,

455
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,140
他居然在水里摔倒了
and he trips underwater.

456
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,700
看在比目鱼的份上谁会在水里摔跤?
Who in the halibut trips underwater?

457
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,240
- 还有...踩到什么了? - 够了,够了,我受够了
- And by the way, on what? - That's it. That's it, l've had it.

而尼,伯尼 你们去找水里最深的地方
[high-pitched] Ernie. Bernie. Find the deepest hole in the ocean

459
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,520
然后再挖深一点,把他关进去
and when you do, dig deeper. And put him in it.

460
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,890
[wails]

461
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,000
抱歉,孩子,不是我对你有成见 我们只是在商言商
Sorry, kid. lt's nothing personal. lt's just business.

为什么我们的电可以电人
Why is it that me locks can sting other people,

472
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,470
却对我或者你没效?

473
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,070
- [zap] - [screams]

474

法兰奇,你明知道我不能
[Lenny] Frankie, you know l can't do this.

蓝尼,如果想要让老爸高兴,你就得杀生
[Frankie] lf you wanna make Pop happy, you've gotta kill something.

480
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,230
或许我去找条很老的病鱼 在他旁边等就成了
[Lenny] Or, l could find an old, sick fish and just wait.

481

Specific? You want specific? Be a shark for once in your life.

486
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,310

别担心,我不会吃谁的
Don't worry, l won't eat anyone.

839
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,080
如果你还没注意到... 我和其他鲨鱼不同
lf you haven't noticed, l'm different from other sharks.

840
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,210
就这样,不用再提了,晚安
Let's put it that way, leave it at that. Good night.

841
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,280
- 什么不同? - 你会嘲笑我
- Define ''different''. - You'll laugh.

842
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,790
我不会
l'm not gonna laugh.

843
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,690
说说罢了,待会儿你就会
That's what you say, and then what happens? You laugh.

844
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,750
蓝尼,我保证
Lenny, l give you my word.

845
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,260
好吧,我告诉你
Okay, l will tell you.

846
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,600
我是...我是吃素的
l'm... l'm a vegetarian.

847
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,110
等等
[stifles laugh] Hold up.

848
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,110
- 就这样? - 就这样是啥意思?
- So that's it? - Tch! What do you mean, that's it?

849
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,750
你是第一个我告诉的人 保密好累人
You're the first fish l ever told. l'm tired of keeping it a secret.

850
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,950
我爸爸...他不能接受我这个样子
And my dad, he'll never accept me for who l am.

851
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,020
我倒底是怎么了?
What's wrong with me?

852
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,560
你很正常,老兄
Nothin' is wrong with you, man.

853
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:01,430
我认为,所有的鲨鱼都该像你一样
l think all sharks should be like you.

854
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,560
天,你真会安慰我
God, that's sweet of you to say.

855
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,730
不要在怪自己啦
And stop blaming yourself for what happened.

856
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,860
真的?
Really?

857
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,000
如果真要怪,就怪我好了
lf you wanna blame anybody, blame me.

858
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,170
如果我没去那里,就不会发生了
lf l hadn't been there in the first place, none of this would've happened.

859
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,180
对呀,如果老爸知道真相 他肯定不会饶了你
Jeez, if Pop knew that, he'd ice you for sure.

860
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,420
饶!?...呵...难道他是黑帮教父?
''lce''. What's he, the Godfather or something?

861
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,390
- 对 - 啥意思?
- Yeah. - Whatcha mean, ''yeah''?

862

你没事儿吧?
Hey. Are you all right?

865
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,220

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,460
- [laughs] - [bleeping]

867
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,570
- 我都说过啦 - 我有照做呀
- Man. l told ya. - l'm doing it.

868
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,800
先按Ｘ,再按Ｏ,然后↓↓,再□□
X, circle, X X, double left square, right trigger, down, square, square.

869
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,930
- 喔,按两次□□ - 还真的哩!

00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,720
- 行了,听着... - 从现在你得付我保护费
- Whatever. Listen... - Now you'll have to pay me protection.

876
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:05,790
赛斯,解除合约 我杀的人是唐・李诺的儿子
Sykes. The deal is off. That shark l killed was Don Lino's son.

877
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,590
- 我知道,又如何? - 如何? 万一他知道了
- l know. Ain't it great? - Not if he finds out.

878

对,屠鲨者现在就在我面前
That's right, l got the Sharkslayer right here in front of me.

And he's gonna slay you and all your sharks.

881

- 但是我饿了
- But l'm hungry. - [sighs]

893
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,160
我的手下会来教训你,屠鲨者
My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer.

894
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,070
把你身上的鳞一片一片扒下来
They're gonna tear you fin from fin.

895
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,670
现在知道谁是你干爸了吧? 我一定会照顾你的,对吧?
Come on, who's your puff daddy? Who takes care of you?

They'll write songs about you.

899
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,110
# 鲨鱼,满嘴牙 #
Oh, the shark bites

900
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,170

# 痛扁他们 #
Kicked his butt

903
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,220
赛斯,老兄
Sykes, man!

904
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,450
- 别这样 - 或许我能帮你
- Come on. - [Lola] Maybe l can help.

905
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:21,630
嗨,萝拉 你在这儿干嘛

你常常突然就出现了
You just be poppin' up, sometimes, places.

907
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,200

908
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,500
- 你叫我等的呀,所以...
- Well, you said to wait, so... [claps] - [sexy music starts]

909
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,560
我一直在等
l've been waiting.

910
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,470
我...真的没时间
[laughs nervously] Look, l don't have a lot of time

911
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,130
拍手,关灯
for the hand-clappy makin'-the-lights-go-off

912
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,200
音乐...共度良宵
music-playing-in-the-dark thing.

913
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,910
- 你怕什么? - 怕! 哈哈
- What are you afraid of? - Afraid... [laughs]

914
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,040
好笑,我怎么会怕! 只是...呜哇
Yeah, that's funny. l ain't afraid of nothin', it's just... Ooh.

915
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,450
宝贝,你太紧张了
Oh, baby, you are so tense.

916
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,120
对呀,最近工作压力大 得保护礁镇
Yeah, l've been stressed lately, you know, protecting the reef.

917
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,180
就我一人,实在...
l do that by myself, you know.

918
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,860
- 太要命了 - 工作太重,过度劳累
- lt's just crazy. - lt's too much, it's piling up...

919
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,960
对呀,一个案子接着一个
Yeah, you know, one thing on top of the other.

920
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,370
我正考虑要退休了
Actually, l was thinking about retiring.

921
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,200
- 你不想退休 - 我不想?
- You don't want to do that. - l don't?

922
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,640
你的最高成就得来不易
You have worked your way to the top.

923
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,470
你不想再做个人下人,是吗?
You don't want to go back to the bottom, do you?

924
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,170
当然不
No.

925
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,500
不
No.

926
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,740
决不
No way.

927
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:20,050
你只要给他们点儿颜色 那些鲨鱼就不敢接近你
You just show 'em who's boss and those sharks will leave you alone.

928
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,410
对,你说的对 蓝尼
Yeah, you're right. [aside] Lenny.

929
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,090
[handle clicks, creaking]

930
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,300
噗嘶!
Psst!

931
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,130
蓝尼?你在哪儿?
Lenny? Where are you?

932
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,230
哈,奥斯卡
Hello, Oscar.

933
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,570
安姬,嘿,你怎么会这儿?
Angie. Hey, what are you doing here?

934
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,410
怎么啦? 你忘了东西?
What, did you forget something?

935
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,880
或许你忘了...你的鲨鱼
Oh, maybe you forgot your shark.

936
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,250
[slurping]

937
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,310
嗨
Hi.

938
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,190
鲨鱼! 安姬我掩护你
Uh... Shark! Swim, Angie, l'll cover you.

939
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,050
快,不然就来不及了 你一个人先回去
Quick, before it's too late. Go on without me.

940
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:00,460
少来啦,你的宠物鲨把真相都告诉我了
Oh, stop it. Your pet shark here told me everything.

941
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,000
啥! 蓝尼,你为什么要说?
Dang, Lenny, why would you do that?

942
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,260
我...我也不知道...我喜欢她
l don't know... l like her.

943
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,270
谢谢,我也喜欢你
Thank you. l like you, too.

944
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,930
你头壳坏啦,怎么把他带来了
What were you thinking, bringing him in here?

945
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,170
我...只是暂时...我再想法解决
No, l'm still working out the kinks.

946
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,370
解决! 你撒谎
Kinks? You lied.

947
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,710
大家都以为 你真的宰了鲨鱼
Everybody thinks you slayed the shark.

948
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,610
- 我怎么能说大家都错了呢? - 你怎能骗我呢!? 骗"我"啊!
- Who am l to tell them they're wrong? - How could you lie to me? Me!

949
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,620
不是针对你一人 得了,我是骗了所有的人
Don't take it personally. Come on, l lied to everybody.

950
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,680
好吧,对不起,算我错了 我是真的骗了你
All right, look, l'm sorry. l totally betrayed you,

951
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,350
但听着...我只有一个小问题,还待解决
but listen, l got just one little problem l gotta take care of.

952
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,890
- 又是什么问题? - 鲨鱼黑帮份子会来找我!
- Oh, what's that? - Sharks are coming to get me!

953
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,490
他们会的 我的意思是,你活该
And they should. l mean, what'd you expect?

954
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,560
你以为宰了一只鲨鱼
You'd take credit for killing a shark,

955
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,630
你下半辈子还能平安过日子?
and then everything would be fine and dandy for the rest of your life?

956
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,640
呃...对呀
Uh... yeah.

957
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,870
但...别担心...没事的
But, hey, don't you worry about it.

958
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,310
蓝尼和我,我们可以解决问题
Me and Lenny got it. We gonna fix it.

959
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,440
"我们"是啥意思? 可别把我也拖下水
''We''? l don't want any part of this.

960
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,250
现在说太晚了,吃素的 他们也会来找你
Too late, veggie-boy. They're lookin' for you, too.

961
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,650
说的也是...现在怎么办?
Point taken. What's the plan?

962
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,620
- 好...咱们就这样... - 奥斯卡,我有个主意
- This is what we gonna do. - [Angie] Here's the plan.

963
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,750
你说出真相 你呢...回家
You tell the truth. And, you, go home.

964
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,990
[both laugh]

965
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,530
好吧,听好,咱们这么干
All right, look, this is what we're gonna do.

966
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,360
我用红油漆把你涂的血淋淋
We're gonna paint you up all bloody. A mess, right?

967
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,700
然后在鲨鱼来之前,去堵住他们
Then you gonna swim out and meet the sharks before they get here.

968
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:22,970
你就说,停! 不要再往前走了
And you're gonna say, ''Stop. Don't y'all. Don't go no farther!''

969
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,170
那个屠鲨者跟疯了一样
''That Sharkslayer's crazy, man!''

970
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:29,050
把我打的浑身是伤 简直是个冷血杀手
''He beat me senseless. He's a stone-cold killer, man!''

971
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,140
然后你就说我很壮 还有我很帅,就这么说
Then you could tell 'em l'm huge. Tell 'em l'm handsome.

972
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,250
你也掰的太离谱了,奥斯卡
- Throw that in, say l'm buff. - You are going way too far.

973
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,880
其实...还不够离谱
Actually, he hasn't gone far enough.

974
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,990
没错!啥?
Exactly. What?

975
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,900

One more thing. What's with all y'all living in the Love Boat?

1270
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,020
- 奥斯卡 - 你们是黑帮耶

[retches]

1276
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:49,230
The horror. The horror.
[Lenny] The horror. The horror.

1277
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,350
呃...对不起

01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,680
- 安姬,你没事吧 - 怎么会没事
- Ang, are you OK? - No, l'm not OK.

1279

他吃了我...
He ate me..

我实在受不了,味道太恶心了
l couldn't take it. The taste was killin' me.

1281
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,920
蓝尼?
Lenny?

1282
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,060
是你吗?

你穿的是啥?啥玩意儿?
What are you wearing? Huh? What is that?

1286
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,450
[gasps of astonishment]

1287
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,460
老板,是蓝尼 他易容了,所以我们认不出他来
Boss, it's Lenny. He was wearing a disguise so we wouldn't recognize him,

1288
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:41,730
现在他恢复原貌,所以我们就认出来啦
but now he's not wearing a disguise, so we do recognize him.

1289
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:45,390
- 嗨,老爸 - 你搞啥?
- Hi, Pop. - Are you kiddin' me?

1290

你搞啥? 你疯啦!
Are you kiddin' me? Are you outta your mind?

你知道自己看起来像啥吗?
Do you have any idea how this looks?

1292
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:53,740
这是我参加过最精彩的谈判
This is the best sit-down l've ever been to.

1293
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,370
你怎么会跟他在一起 他杀的你的亲兄弟法兰奇呀
What are you doing with him? He took out your flesh and blood, Frankie.

1294
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,420
- 可是,老爸,听我解释... - 没有可是
- But, Pop, listen... - But nothing.

1295
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,010
你决不能背叛自己的亲人,绝不
You never take sides against the family. Ever.

1296
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:07,280
喂...唐...李诺...先生 听着,这不是他的错,是咱们之间的恩怨
Hey, Don. Lino. Sir. lt's not his fault. This is between you and me.

1297
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,260
我又没把你怎样
What did l ever do to you?

1298
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:13,520
你怎能杀了法兰奇,又把蓝尼变成了海豚
You took Frankie away and you turned Lenny into a dolphin.

1299
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,460
我决不会放过你

- 奥斯卡,小心 - 奥斯卡,快逃,快逃命
- [Angie] Oscar, look out. - Oscar, swim. Swim for your life.

1301
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,030
从你成为屠鲨者那天起 你就一定会后悔
You're gonna regret the day you became the Sharkslayer.

1302
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:32,160

- 再试一次 - 鲸鱼洗车

- 他就在我后面,对吧? - 你是我的了

我跟他的死没关系,蓝尼也没有
l didn't have anything to do with it, and neither did Lenny.

1344

如果是真的,那你干嘛要逃走?

因为你总是想让我和法兰奇一样

- You're blowin' it, man. - Mind your business.

现在是很感性,很紧张的一刻
lt's emotional and it's pressure.

1367
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,210
我是说...我只是...
What l'm saying, l just...

1368
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:16,480
我根本不在乎住礁顶
l didn't need the top of the reef.

1369
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,430
一切我想要的...就在我面前,一直都在
Everything l wanted was right there in front of me the whole time.

1370
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:24,760
那出人头地的事怎么办?
Well, what about being a somebody?

1371
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:27,630
