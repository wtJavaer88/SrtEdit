冰河世纪3：恐龙现身

00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:26,696
大家等等我啊
Wait up guys!

6
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,142
宝宝要生了！我要当爸爸了！
The baby is coming! The baby is coming! I'm having a baby.

7
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,261
- 蓝色警报 蓝色警报了 - 要是女孩就是粉色
- Code blue, code blue, - Or pink if it's a girl

8
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:42,962
生宝宝了！生宝宝了！ 艾莉 我来了！
Coming up baby! Coming up baby! I'm coming, Ellie!

9
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:45,257
抓住了
We got it.

10
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:03,510
艾莉 艾莉 你在哪 我在哪？
Ellie, Ellie, Where are you, Where am I? 

11
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,234
曼尼！
Manny!

12
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:09,343
我说过了 只是宝宝踢了一下而已
I told you! It was just a kick.

13
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:14,348
哦 对啊！对啊 哈哈
Ohh right! Right, oh wow.

14
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,249
你可真把你老爸吓死了！ 瞧老爸傻的
Ohh you really gave daddy a scare! Daddy got silly.

15
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:22,429
老爸从悬崖上溜下来
Daddy fall down cliff and go,

16
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,609
然后就嘣 嘣 嘣！傻老爸
boom, boom, boom. Silly daddy.

17
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:34,889
抱歉了 各位 虚惊一场 宝宝只是踢了一下
Sorry, folks. False alarm. It was just a kick.

18
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,558
你知道我想踢谁嘛？
Do you know who I want to kick?

19
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:38,226
你这周都已经“虚惊”了三次了
That's the third false alarm this week.

20
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:41,981
好了 没啥好看的 都散了吧 散了吧！
Allright show's over... break it up, break it up!

21
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:46,672
哦~瞧瞧谁的小肚子也有小宝宝了
Oh I see someone else who has a bun in the oven?

22
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,341
我没怀孕！
I'm not pregnant!

23
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:52,824
真可惜 你会是个好妈妈的
Too bad, you'd make a wonderful mother.

24
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,431
曼尼 我知道你很高兴 我也是
Manny I know your excited, I am too,

25
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:58,037
可你这样也有点太小题大做了
but your getting a little carried away.

26
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:03,564
好了 好了 听你这口气 越来越像迪亚哥了
Okay, okay, Boy, your starting to sound like Diego.

27
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:08,465
等等…迪亚哥哪去了？
Wait a second... Where is Diego?

28
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:05,084
我可是蹄下生风啊 宝贝儿！ 蹄下生风！
My hooves are burning, baby! They are burning!

29
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,795
哦 瞧这儿啊 我踮脚跑！
Oh, look at this, I got to tip-Toe!

30
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:10,402
我踮脚跑！你就吃灰去吧 哈哈！
I got to tip-Toe! Eat my dust, dingo!

31
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,016
现在能睁眼了嘛？
Huh, can I look now?

32
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:18,014
别太激动哦 小心伤着孩子
Easy, don't freak out the baby.

33
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:22,080
孩子好得很 我现在倒是担心他老爸
The baby is fine. It's the freaked out daddy I'm worried about.

34
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,313
嘿 别偷看
Ah-Uh-Uh, No peeking.

35
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:30,318
- 嗒嗒！游乐场在此… - 哇！
- Voila! Playground for junior... - Ohh wow!

36
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:41,996
太美了
It's amazing.

37
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:58,054
- 曼尼… - 这是我做的 我们一家
- Ohh Manny... - I made it myself, our family.

38
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:05,457
为什么这上面没我？
Hey why aren't I up there?

39
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:09,941
- 你可以上我们家 - 肯定很合适
- You can be on ours. - You'd fit right in.

40
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:12,652
当然了 这工程还没完工
Of course it's still work in progress.

41
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:15,363
还有毛边要处理，这里 还有这里
Few rough edges, here and there.

42
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,377
真不敢相信 你这是要给孩子另造一个天地
I don't believe it, your trying to baby proof nature.

43
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,724
另造一个？哪有
Baby proof nature? Get outta here.

44
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:25,686
那也太扯了
That's ridiculous.

45
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:29,335
曼尼 我们的孩子以后肯定会在这里生活
Manny, this is the world our baby's gonna grow up in.

46
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:30,587
你可改变不了冰川世纪
You can't change that.

47
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:35,487
我当然可以 我是地球上最大的
Of course I can, I'm the biggest thing on earth.

48
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,744
好吧 大块头老爹 我真想看看
Okay big daddy, I can't wait to see,

49
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:40,000
你怎么应付小孩
how you handle the teen years.

50
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:45,142
跟上 希德 别乱碰东西
Come on, Sid. I don't want you touching anything.

51
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:46,540
这地方是给孩子们玩的
This place is for kids.

52
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:53,109
你是小孩吗？不用答了
Are you a kid? Don't answer that.

53
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,631
迪亚哥 你在这啊
Diego, there you are.

54
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,081
刚刚你可错过了一份大惊喜
You missed the big surprise.

55
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:11,252
- 是嘛 我待会再看吧 - 好 回见
- I'll check it out later. - Okay, See ya.

56
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:14,172
我觉得 迪亚哥好像有心事
You know, I think there's something bothering, Diego.

57
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,423
怎么会 肯定没事的啦
No, I'm sure everything's fine.

58
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,300
你该去和他聊聊
You should talk to him.

59
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,906
男人可不会聊 男人的事
Guys don't talk to guys, about guy problems.

60
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:23,357
我们互相捶一下肩就好了
We just punch each other on the shoulders.

61
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:24,807
那也太蠢了！
That's stupid!

62
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,623
对女人来说是的 可对男人来说
To a girl, but for a guy,

63
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,438
那可顶的上六个月的心理治疗
that's like six months of therapy.

64
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:35,338
好了 好了 我去就是了
Okay, Okay I'm going.

65
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:40,135
- 嘿 - 喂！
- Hey. - Oww!

66
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:46,600
- 你干嘛呢？ - 我也不晓得
- Why'd you do that? - I don't know.

67
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:52,856
是这么个事儿 艾莉觉得你有心事…
So listen, Ellie thinks theres something bothering you...

68
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,880
说真的 我是在想 很快
Actually, I've been thinking, that soon,

69
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:58,904
可能 我就该出发了
it might be time for me to head out.

70
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:03,075
哦 那我就跟她说你没事了 嘛事没有
Okay, so I'll just tell her that your fine. It was nothing.

71
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:06,438
我们能哄得了谁呢 曼尼？我越来越不像只剑齿虎了
Look, who are we kidding, Manny? I'm losing my edge.

72
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:09,592
而且 我也不适合整天帮你看小孩
I'm not really built for chaperoning play-Dates.

73
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:11,103
你说什么呢？
What do you talking about?

74
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:15,066
成家生子 这是大事 我很为你高兴 可是…
Having a family, that's huge. And I'm happy for you, but...

75
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,672
这是你的探险故事 不再是我的
It's your adventure, not mine.

76
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,966
你是说你不想和我一起带小孩？
So you don't want to be around my kid?

77
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,095
不是这个意思 你… 你误会我说的话了
No, no, no, t-Thats... your taking this the wrong way.

78
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,848
 你去吧 探险去吧 大探险家！
No go, go find some adventure. Mr. Adventure guy!

79
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,142
别让我家这点破事
Don't let my boring domestic life

80
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:31,436
搅了你的兴致 拖你后腿
hit you on the bottom, on your way out.

81
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,607
荷尔蒙失调的原来不止艾莉一个？
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one with the hormonal imbalance?

82
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,674
曼尼 等下！大家都不用走啊
Manny, wait! No one has to leave.

83
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:42,697
- 怎么样？ - 跟你说了男人就不该聊
- So? - That's why guys don't talk to guys.

84
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:48,224
- 怎么回事 - 迪亚哥要走了
- Why what happened. - Diego's leaving.

85
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,978
喂 喂 现在可是咱们的黄金时代了
Whoa, whoa, this should be the best time of our lives.

86
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:54,063
我们都快有宝宝了
We're having a baby.

87
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:57,244
错了 希德 是他们要有宝宝了
No, Sid. They're havin' a baby.

88
00:09:57,244 --> 00:10:00,424
可我们是一起的呀 我们是一家人呀
Yeah but, we're a herd. We're a family

89
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:05,846
今日不同往昔了 曼尼有其他事情要操心
Look things have changed. Manny has other priority's now.

90
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:09,287
接受现实吧 希德 我们有过快乐的过去
Face it, Sid. We had a great run,

91
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:12,206
可现在…是时候分道扬镳了
 but... now it's time to move on.

92
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:15,387
那 就是说 只剩下我们两个了
So it's just the two of us.

93
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:18,150
又错 希德 不是两个
No, Sid. It's not the two of us.

94
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,904
喀什和艾迪也跟我们一起？
Crash and Eddie, are coming with us?

95
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:26,700
就喀什？艾迪？
Just, Crash? Just, Eddie?

96
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:32,123
别了 希德
Goodbye, Sid.

97
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:47,137
好了 冷静 冷静 交朋友是我的拿手好戏
Okay, calm down. Calm down. I'm good at making friends.

98
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:51,100
我自己招一帮子人 对 就是这样！
I'll make my own herd. That's what I'll do!

99
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:56,522
嘿！大家玩的怎么样啊？
Hey! "Me amigo's. Que pasa?"

100
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,844
好吧 至少还有帅的脸
Well, at least you still got your looks.

101
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,565
哦 这下可好
Ohh great!!

102
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:29,472
有人在吗？
Anybody here?

103
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:51,473
嗨~？
Hello?

104
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:03,256
哦 可怜的小家伙 我知道被人抛弃的感受
Oh poor guys, I know what it's like to feel abandoned

105
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:13,578
别担心 你们不再孤独了
Don't worry, you're not alone anymore.

106
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:46,215
乖乖呆好
There you go.

107
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:02,282
呆在这！照顾好你弟弟
Stay here! You take care of your brother now,

108
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,732
妈妈马上回来
momma's coming right back.

109
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:08,320
宝宝 妈妈来了！
Momma's coming, baby!

110
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,202
接到了
I got you.

111
00:13:17,288 --> 00:13:20,937
我刚才怎么跟你说的
What did I just tell you kids?

112
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:28,922
哦 谢谢 谢谢！
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

113
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:33,614
坏蛋 大坏蛋 你们真快把妈妈吓出心脏病了
Bad eggs, rotten eggs. A heart attack you almost gave me.

114
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:37,159
哦 对不起 小宝宝 我只是太爱你们了
Ohh I'm sorry darling, it's just that I love you so much.

115
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,600
好了 来见见你们曼尼叔叔和艾莉婶婶

116
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,894
你好呀！
Hello!

117
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,586
我给你们介绍 蛋蛋 蛋壳 蛋黄
I'd like to present, Eggbert, Shelly and Yoko.

118
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:51,653
希德 不管你在干什么 都不是好主意
Sid, whatever you're doing. It's a bad idea!

119
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,791
嘘！孩子们会听到的
Shh! My kids will hear you.

120
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,762
他们不是你的孩子 希德 哪拿的放哪去
They're not your kids, Sid. Take them back.

121
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,213
- 你不适合当家长 - 为什么？
- You're not meant to be a parent. - Why not?

122
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,663
首先 你偷蛋
First sign: stealing someone else's eggs.

123
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:05,417
其次 有个差点成了蛋卷
Second sign: one of them almost became an omelet.

124
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:09,275
希德 蛋妈妈肯定在急着找他们呢
Sid, someone must be worried sick looking for them.

125
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,464
不可能 他们是在地下的 冰洞里
No, they were underground, in ice.

126
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:16,887
要不是我发现了 他们早就成… 冰蛋蛋了
If it wasn't for me they'd be... Egg sickles.

127
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,128
希德 我知道你有多难受
Sid, I know what your going through.

128
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,370
总有一天 你会成家立业的
You're gonna have a family too someday.

129
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:24,290
你会遇上个好女孩…
You gonna meet a nice girl, with...

130
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,878
她要求不高 也不挑 还有股味道…
with low standards, no real options, or sense of smell...

131
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:31,224
曼尼的意思是…
What Manny means to say is...

132
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,466
别说了 我明白 我送他们回去
No, I get it. I'll take them back.

133
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:39,097
你们去过两人世界 我只能孤苦伶仃
You have your family and I'm better off alone. By myself.

134
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,955
呆在我的“孤独城堡”里 （超人在南极的家也叫这…）
A fortress of solitude.

135
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:47,751
呆在冰天雪地里 永不超生！
In the ice, for ever!

136
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:50,880
一个人 孤单寂寞…
Alone, lonely loner..

137
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,695
- “一个人”还真不少 - 没错！
- That's a lot of aloners. - Precisely!

138
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,082
- 希德 等下 - 不用叫他 没事的
- Sid, wait. - No, no, it's ok.

139
00:15:57,084 --> 00:16:01,724
他会自己蹦回来的 这也算是希德的一样特异功能
He'll bounce back, it's one of the advantages of being Sid.

140
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:15,487
我为什么一定要把你们放回去呢 我喜欢小孩子
Why should I take you back. I love kids.

141
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:22,056
我又有责任心 又有爱心 还有细心 你们说呢？
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing. What do you think?

142
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:27,791
我就知道你们也这么想
I knew you would agree.

143
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:35,403
哦 别哭哇 我给你们找个干燥的地方

这地儿全毁了
This place is totalled.

00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,053
可不是我们干的
And we didn't reck it.

199
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:58,138
咱们没机会破处（女地）了！
We're losing our touch bro!

200
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:02,257
最重要的是没人受伤
The important thing is that no one got hurt.

201
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,664
除了这个
Except for that guy.

那三个…还有她

我让你把他们带回去 可你却留着！

00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:14,404
看看现在这团糟！

205
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:17,533
好吧 我同意 他们是有点不听话
Okay granted, we do have some discipline issues.

206
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,409
吃人家小孩可不止是不听话
Eating kids is not a discipline issue.

207
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,339
可他也吐出来了啊！
But he spit them out!

208
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:25,353

他们不属于这里 希德
They don't belong here, Sid.

210

我不管你是从哪儿找到他们的 你给我送回去
Whatever they are wherever you found them, take them back.

211

曼尼 我可不会抛下我孩子！
Manny, I'm not getting rid of my kids!

212
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,012
地震了！

213
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:43,496
没事没事 有妈妈在！
It's Okay, It's okay, mamma's here!

214
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,605
地震还会叫唤吗？
Do earthquakes, shriek?

215
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:18,323
我以为这些家伙都灭绝了
I thought those guys were extinct.

我们是迷途的小羊羔
We are poor little lambs who have lost our way.

221
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:40,280
希德！把孩子们还给她 她才是妈妈！
Sid! Give them to her. She's their mother.

222
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,991
我怎么知道 她不是冒牌的？
How do I know, she's their mother?

223
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:46,900
你还想怎么 看出生证吗？她是头恐龙！
What do you want, a birth certificate? She's a *Dinosaur*!

224
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:50,706
我含辛茹苦 一把屎一把尿地把他们拉扯大
Well I've put in the, blood, sweat and tears to raise them.

225
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:54,773
拉扯了一天！快把孩子还给她 疯子！
For a day! Give them back, you Lunatic!

230
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:27,618
- 救命啊！ - 希德？
- Help! - Sid?

231
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,667
希德肯定是被带下去了
Sid must be down there.

232
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,909
好吧 他肯定是完了 真可惜
Well, his dead! Real shame.

- 你就说给我鼻子听吧 - 哦 太棒了

等我们救出希德 我要杀了他
after we save Sid! I'm gonna kill him.

241
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:12,090
- 女士优先 - 老人优先

You gotta tell me. And we're outta here.

248
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,690
咱得先想个代号
We need a code word.

249
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:03,236
嗯 来表示“要生孩子了”
Yeah, something that says, "the baby's coming."

250

嗯 这个怎么样 “啊！要生了！”
Hmm. How about, "Aaah! The baby's coming!" How's that?

- 就跟你一样 - 你说我长得圆？

你们来这干什么？
What are you doing here?

283

曼尼！我们都走了这么远了 一定能找到他的
Manny! We came this far, we're gonna find him.

288
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:06,247
我发现线索了
I got tracks.

289
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:10,001
走吧
Let's go.

290
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:14,589
如果你们进去了 找到你们的朋友 是…
If you go in there, you'll find your friend...

291
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,361
下辈子吧！

292
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:21,054
你怎么知道？这位伟大智慧的黄鼠狼
How do you know? Oh great and wisely, weasely one.

恐龙妈妈叼着三只小恐龙
Mummy dinosaur carrying three babies,

294
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:34,817
还有一个软绵绵的绿东西？

00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:37,893
对啊 我们的朋友就是那个软绵绵的绿东西
Yeah, we're friends with the floppy green thing.

296
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:38,884
你光看脚印就知道这么多？
You got all that from the tracks?

297
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:42,481
也不是啦  我之前看到他们经过
No, not really. I saw 'em come through here earlier.

298
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:43,681
她往“熔岩瀑布”去了
She's headed for Lava Falls.

299
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:47,643
他们在那养小恐龙
That's where they care, for the newborns.

300
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:51,813
要到那儿 你得穿过“悲惨森林”
To get there! You got to go through the jungle of misery.

301
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:55,776
横渡“死亡峡谷”
Across the chasm of death.

302
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:01,094
- 直抵“惊呼之地” - 哇！！！

嘿 嘿 嘿！
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa!

307
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:13,762
你以为你们是来热带旅游吗？
What, you-You think this is some sort of tropical getaway?

308
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:16,838
你根本保护不了你老婆！老兄！
You can't protect your mate! Mate!.

309
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:20,228
你能干什么 嗯？ 就靠这些脆生生的小象牙？
What are you gonna do with those-Those flimsy tusks..?

310
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:23,825
你要是碰上那头怪物呢 怎么办？
When you run into the Beast?

311
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:27,682
我叫他“鲁迪”
I call him "Rudy".

312
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:31,228
哦 就这样啊 我还以为会更吓人点
Oh good. Good. I was worried it was

313
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,669
比如“小强” “小黄”之类的
something intimidating, like, Sheldon or Tim.

314
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:38,006
等等！你是说 有什么东西比母恐龙还大？
Wait! You mean there's something *bigger* than Mommy Dinosaur..?

315
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,153
正是！
Aye!

316
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,551
- 眼睛？ - 正是！
- Eye? - Aye! Aye!

317
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:44,314
我的这个 就是拜他所赐
He's the one that gave me *this*

318
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:46,973
哇 他送你这个眼罩？
Whoa. He gave you that patch?

319
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:49,737
免费的？太酷了！
For free? That's so cool.

320
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:52,500
说不定 他也会送我们！
Yeah, maybe he'll give *us* one, too!

321
00:35:55,941 --> 00:36:00,841
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

322
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,315
- 擅闯禁地者 全无希望！ - 好了 知道了
- Abandon all hope, he who enters there! - Alright we get it.

323
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:10,851
唯有厄运与绝望相伴…
Doom and despair. Yadda, yadda, yadda.

324
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:28,846
听起来 还真是个“悲惨森林”
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

325
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:44,486
- 等下 - 怎么了 出什么事了 是来“桃子”了吗？
- Hold on. - Why, what's wrong? Peaches?

326
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,406
不是 我只是觉得有点怪怪的
No, it's just I got a funny feeling.

327
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:50,013
你饿了吧 哦 低血糖！
You're hungry. Low blood sugar!

328
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:53,142
- 那儿有果子 - 曼尼 别去！
- There's some fruit. - No, Manny!

329
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:55,853
我要是你 可不会乱摘东西
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

330
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:58,824
这里可不是你熟悉的地盘
This isn't exactly your playground.

331
00:37:58,824 --> 00:38:01,795
说得好像我会怕小花小草似的
Like I'm going to be afraid of a pretty flower.

332
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:08,365
- 你刚才可没料到这个吧？ - 曼尼？
- Bet you didn't see that coming? - Manny?

333
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:12,640
郑重申明 这全都怪你
For the record, I blame you for this.

334
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:17,124
不准吃我们的朋友 大花怪！
Stop eating our friends, plant!

335
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:24,057
够了 我要把你连根拔起
That's it, I'm tearing it up, from the roots.

336
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:27,133
要这么干 花瓣就会一直合着
Do that and it'll clamp-Shut forever.

337
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:30,000
好了 孕妇同志 别吓的鼻子都打结
Alright, preggers. Don't get your trunk in a knot.

338
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,598
- 我来把他们弄出来 乘还没被消化 - 消化？
- I'll have them out of there before they're digested. - Digested?

339
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,528
过个三分钟 他们除了骨头可就什么都不剩了
They'll be nothing but bones in 3 minutes.

340
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:39,333
- 那个胖的可能得五分钟 - 我不胖！
- Well maybe 5 for the fat one! - I'm not fat!

341
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:42,097
- 我觉得有点酥麻 - 别说这种话
- I feel tingly. - Don't say that,

342
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:43,713
你还贴着我呢
when your pressed up against me.

343
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:49,760
- 不是那种酥麻 - 啊 我也酥麻了
- Not that kind of tingly. - I can feel it too.

344
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:53,306
- 救命 来人啊！ - 快！
- Help, someone help us! - Hurry!

345
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:57,476
看我巴克的手段！
It's time to get... Buck wild.

346
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:09,468
现在知道谁胖了？
Who's fat now?

347
00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:34,076
不要！
No!

348
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:19,016
- 一群观光客 - 被朵花吐了 帅呆了！

349
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:24,438
- 说话呀 - 谢谢你救了我们
- Say something. - Thank's for saving us.

350
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:28,662
你能帮我们找那个“软绵绵的绿东西”吗？ 
Will you help us find the floppy green thing?.

351
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:30,486
- 不用吧 - 要的
- That's not necessary. - Yes it is.

352
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:37,785

走路只走路中间 第三：
Stay in the middle of the trail. Rule number three:

355
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,407
爱放屁的 到队尾去
He who has gas, travels at the back of the pack.

356
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:59,317

357
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:01,767
我们真该去查查自己还正不正常
We should all have our heads examined.

358
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:08,128
那是第四条 现在 去找你朋友先
That's rule number four. Now, let's go find your friend.

359
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:30,755
哦 好了 好了 表担心 我们都会没事的
Oh it's okay, it's okay. Don't worry, we're gonna be fine.

360
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:35,447
麻烦能不能晃得轻点…？
Please swing a little more to...?

361
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,997
瞧 她放我们下来了…
See, she's putting us down...

362
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:48,481
表！我这么年轻 不该被吃掉啊！
No! I'm too young to be eaten.

363
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:55,467
哇！这鼻涕长得真有型 可不是人人都有啊
Wow! Nice mucus. And I don't care for, everyone.

364
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:10,170
那个 这些事情是很复杂啦
Listen these things get complicated.

365
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,151
也许我们能商量个办法
Maybe we can work something out.

366
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:14,809
周日到周二我带？
I can have them on Sundays to Tuesdays?

368
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:27,583
没事 妈妈没事！
It's Okay, mommas okay!

369
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:35,299
你要是吃了我 对孩子们影响不好
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

370
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:42,285
哈哈！看看孩子们护着谁 我得一分！
Ha! Score one for the sloth!

371
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:49,896
现在就算打的难解难分吧
And the scores all tied up.

372
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:56,570
你觉得那个怪物会不会找到希德？
Do you think the beast will find, Sid?

373
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:58,030
最主要是 会不会找到 我们？
Or more importantly, us?

374
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,888
鲁迪？开玩笑 他可是不知疲倦的
Rudy? Are you joking? He's relentless.

375
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:05,746
他洞察一切 吞噬一切
He knows all, sees all eats all.

376
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:09,395
也就是说 会了
So that's a, yes.

00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,590
嘿 从我家草坪上滚开 走！
Hey, get off my lawn! Go on shoo!!

378
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,932
那家伙 他还是毛毛虫的时候我就认识
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.

379
00:43:24,932 --> 00:43:26,808
你知道的啦 就是他还没变态的时候
You know, before he came out.

380
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:29,311
这么说 你就这么靠智慧生存！
So your just living down here by your wits!

381
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:31,814
孤身一人 了无牵挂？
All on your own, no responsibilities?

382
00:43:31,814 --> 00:43:35,098
就我一个！岂不妙哉 没有依赖
Not one! It's incredible. No dependence,

383
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,383
自由自在 真是每个单身汉的梦想
no limits, the greatest life a single guy can have.

384
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:41,406
你听到没？这就是我想呆的地方
Did you hear that? This is my kind of place.

385
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:44,952
喂？不行啊 现在不方便说话…
Hello? No... No I can't really talk right now...

386
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:47,558
我得去给个死树懒收尸
I'm trying to recover a dead sloth.

387
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:51,938
现在他们还跟着我呢！
Now, They're following Me!

388
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:54,545
我知道！他们还以为我疯了
I know! They think I'm crazy.

389
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:57,151
好了…我们快到“死亡峡谷”了
O-Okay... We're going into the Chasm of Death,

390
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:59,758
信号不好 快断了 我也爱你
I'm gonna lose you. I love you too.

391
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:04,242
好了 拜拜 嘿 都跟上！
Alright, goodbye. Goodbye, bye. Okay, follow me!

392
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:08,830
你三星期后也会变成这样
That's you in three weeks.

393
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:28,329
那个 他们干嘛管这个叫“死亡峡谷”？
So, why do they call it the chasm of death?

394
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:30,300
我们也试过“大臭坑”
Well we tried, 'big smelly crack',

395
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:33,760
可是…别人一听就笑
But... uhh, that just made everybody giggle.

396
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,210
接下来怎么办？
Well now what?

397
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:43,240
- 夫人… - 她可不能上这玩意
- Madam... - She is not doing that.

398
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,951
军规第一条
Rule number one.

399
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:51,998
想想吧 大猛犸 不是说你们挺有记性的吗

402
00:45:03,364 --> 00:45:05,280
要是吸入有毒气体 你估计就没救了
Breathe in the toxic fumes and you'll probably die.

403
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
有毒气体？
Toxic fumes.

404
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:11,184
- 又一个阳光灿烂的日子 - 等等！
- Just another day in paradise. - Wait!

405

只是出了点 技术故障
Just some, technical difficulties.

410
00:45:39,377 --> 00:45:42,465
各位坚持住先
Keep holding it in boys.

411
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:47,992
我憋不住了

00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:52,475
他吸气了！哦 我也吸气了！

- 嘿 我们没挂 - 你听起来可真滑稽

414
00:45:58,732 --> 00:46:02,485

417
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:16,666
这不是毒气
It's not poison.

418
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,695
现在麻烦大了
It's so disturbing.

419
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:29,335
不准笑 统统都不准笑！
Stop laughing, all of you!

420
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:32,307
“不准笑 统统都不准笑”
"Stop laughing, all of you!"

421
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:37,834
第一条军规是嘛呀？
What's rule number one?

422
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:41,796
他们只是笑一笑罢了
They're just laughing,

423
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:43,568

这些家伙就是笑死的
They died laughing.

425
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:51,597
- 别笑了！ - 你知道什么最好笑吗？
- Stop laughing! - Do you know what's funny though?

426
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:57,541
我们还想去救希德 可自己却先死翘翘了！
We're trying to save Sid and now we're all gonna die!

427
00:46:57,854 --> 00:47:00,512
我甚至都不怎么喜欢希德
And I don't even like Sid.

428
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:03,171
有谁喜欢呢？他是白痴！
Who does? He's an idiot!

429
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,195
多谢你啊 拖我搅这趟浑水
Thank's for getting me into this mess.

430
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:08,281
这么多年了从来没有这样刺激过
It's the most fun I've had in years.

431
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:14,328
谢谢你啊 玩单飞 真是牛逼！
Thank you, for deserting the herd. That was totally super.

432
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:25,485
停下！还没明白吗？ 我们都要翘辫子了
Stop that! Don't you see? We're all gonna die.

433
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:32,054
什么都得靠我们自己 对不？
We gotta do everything, huh?

434
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:41,700
我有时候会尿床
Sometimes I wet my bed.

435
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,131
没事了 有时候我会尿你的床
That's alright. Sometimes I wet your bed.

436
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,677
我不知道你听到多少？
I'm not sure how much of that you could hear?

437
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,710
哦 我全听到了
Oh I heard all of it.

438
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:05,057
你在我床上尿床？
You wet my bed?

439
00:48:05,057 --> 00:48:07,403
哎呀 中毒说的话，别当真
That was, gas talk dude!.

440
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,270
好了 我们还是赶紧赶路吧
Well, we better get moving.

441
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,720
我们是不是忘了点什么？
Aren't we forgetting something?

442
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,412
我好寂寞哦
I'm so lonely.

443
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:40,143
好了 开饭饭了…吃吧 吃吧
Okay. Here you go guys... Muncher, muncher.

444
00:48:45,149 --> 00:48:48,902
怎么！你们不吃蔬菜？
What! Your not gonna eat your vegetables?

445
00:48:48,903 --> 00:48:52,656
那怎么能长成强壮的大恐龙呢？
How you going to become big and strong, dinosaurs?

446
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,007
不行…我要把他们教育成素食主义
No... I raised them vegetarian.

447
00:49:00,008 --> 00:49:04,335
这样更健康 我就是个最好的例子
It's a healthier lifestyle I mean look at me.

448
00:49:05,169 --> 00:49:10,069
拜托 我跟你说话呢
Excuse me. I'm trying to have a conversation here.

449
00:49:15,492 --> 00:49:18,203
不行不行！我们的孩子不能吃这个
No, no, no! That's not for us kids.

450
00:49:18,203 --> 00:49:20,914
这个太毛太油了 而且…
Way to feathery and fleshy and...

451
00:49:21,435 --> 00:49:24,146
还是活的！
...and alive!

452
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:35,928
不行不行 我们不能吃活的动物 没得商量
No, no, no, we do not eat live animals, period.

453
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:40,099
好了 快飞吧 你自由了
Now go, fly. Be free.

454
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:45,730
不会飞的小小鸟
Little, flightless bird.

455
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:50,943
- 是我不好 - 嘿 你去哪？
- My bad. - Hey, where you going?

456
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:56,783
你就是这么解决矛盾的？ 难怪光棍
This is how you resolve a conflict? No wonder your single.

457
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:01,997
嘿 拜托 我是在自言自语吗？
Oh come on. Am I talking to myself here?

458
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:04,708
我说他们要吃素食 你说“吼”
I say they're vegetarian, you say, 'Grrrr' .

459
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:07,054
我说，我们能谈谈吗？
I say can we talk about this? 

460
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:10,442
你说“吼” 这不叫沟通嘛
You say, Grrrr. I don't call that communication.

461
00:50:10,443 --> 00:50:13,258
瞧 你解决问题就这一套
See, that's your answer to everything.

462
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:30,254
你还怕什么？ 你是地球上最大的了
What are you afraid of? You're the biggest thing on Earth.

463
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,633
不是吗？
Aren't you?

464
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:48,640
他们肯定活不成
They'll never survive,

465
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,238
这里白天就够危险
it's dangerous by day!

466
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,838
晚上就更凶险了
But it's even worse at night.

467
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,288
而且向导是个疯子！
Plus the guide is a lunatic! 

468
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:56,739
说谁呢 巴克？哦 他可是疯的没救了
What you mean, Buck? Oh his whack-O.

469
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:59,241
- 我不是疯子 - 彻底的疯子
- I am not. - Totally bonkers!

470
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:01,744
而且脚臭烘烘！ 闭嘴！ 你闭嘴！
And his feet smell. Shut up! You shut up!

471
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:04,037
你个小混蛋…
Oh you little...

472
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:07,166
他在和自己的脚打架
He's strangling his own foot.

473
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:09,669
我们是不是该上路了？
Shouldn't we get moving?

474
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:12,119
去给鲁迪当夜宵？门都没有
And give, Rudy a midnight snack? Not likely.

475
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,569
这骨头说的没错 他一顿得吃N头大象
The skulls right, take a load of mammals.

476
00:51:14,987 --> 00:51:18,323
我们在这露营 好了 谁饿了？
We'll camp here. Now, who's hungry?

477
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:21,659
我！  你又不需要热量！
I am. You don't need the calories!

478
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:31,044
当时…我的背紧贴着墙 周围没有出路
There I was... My back against the wall. No way out.

479
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:35,632
我栖在深谷的边缘
Perched on a razor's edge of oblivion.

480
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:40,115
突然看到了一头白色庞然大物
Staring into the eye, of the great white beast.

481
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:46,744
- 你死了吗？ - 悲惨的是我死了 但是我又活了！
- Were you killed? - Sadly, yes. But I lived!

482
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:50,967
我从未如此强烈地感受到生命
Never had I felt so alive,

483
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,626
直到我如此近距离地接触…死亡
than when I was so close... To death.

484
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:56,025
转眼间 鲁迪就会把我咽下喉咙
Just before, Rudy could suck me down his gullet.

485
00:52:56,026 --> 00:52:58,579
我紧紧地抱住那个 悬在喉头的
I grabbed hold of that, roast pink fleshy thing

486
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,134
软软的 粉粉的 肉肉的东西
that dangles at the back of the throat.

487
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:05,305
我死死地抱着那玩意儿
I hung on to that sucker,

488
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:09,163
并且前后摇摆 向后向前
and I swung back and forth, back and forth.

489
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:13,490
向后…向前…向后 最后
Back... and forth and back. Until finally

490
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:17,818
我放开手 从他嘴里直直地射了出去！
I let go and shot right out of his mouth.

491
00:53:18,026 --> 00:53:22,822
那一回 我是瞎了一只眼 可我也得到了这个
I may have lost an eye that day. But I got this.

492
00:53:22,823 --> 00:53:25,846
鲁迪的牙齿…
Rudy's tooth...

493
00:53:25,847 --> 00:53:29,235
就像老话说的“以牙还眼”
It's like the old saying: "An eye for a tooth".

494
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:32,624
以下巴还鼻子 以屁股还…
A nose for a chin. A butt for a"...

495
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:34,152
这也是个俗语
It's an old saying. But uh,

496
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:35,681
算了 真的很俗
it's not a very good one.

497
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,212
你真是超级黄鼠狼
You are super weasel.

498
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:41,383
- 终极黄鼠狼 - 超能黄鼠狼
- Ultra weasel. - Diesel weasel.

499
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:47,326
怎么了 他就是
What? He is.

500
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,308
接下来 我给你们讲当年我是怎么
Now let me tell you about the time I used to

501
00:53:49,308 --> 00:53:51,289
怎么用这把锋利的齿刀 把一头霸王龙
sharpen, clam-Shell to turn a T-Rex,

502
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:54,208
- 治得服服帖帖 - 好的 大师
- Into a T-Rachel - Yes master.

503
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:57,440
哇 今晚的故事就到此为止吧
Wow, that's enough fairy-Tales for one night.

504
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,682
来吧 艾莉 你该休息了…
Come on, Ellie. You should rest now...

505
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,924
唉 快乐的时光总是过得太快
Pff..Life at the party.

506
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:04,740
好了 你们去合合眼
Alright, you guys get some shut-Eye,

507
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,451
- 我来守夜 - 别担心 巴克 有我们呢
- I'll keep watch. - Don't worry, Buck, we got this.

508
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:10,683
黑夜就是负鼠的天下
Night time is possum time.

509
00:54:10,683 --> 00:54:13,394
没错 夜晚属于我们
Yeah, we own the night baby.

510
00:54:26,324 --> 00:54:29,139
晚安 鲁迪
Good night, Rudy.

511
00:54:40,713 --> 00:54:43,424
等等 我怎么办？
Wait, wait. What about me?

512
00:54:57,918 --> 00:55:00,420
晚安 宝贝
Sleep well, kids.

513
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,922
明天有得忙呢
We have a busy day tomorrow.

514
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:05,425
锻炼 捕猎…
Forging, Hunting...

515
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:11,160
想念朋友 估计他们不会想我
Missing my friends. Probably are not missing me.

516
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,748
怎么…？
What..?

517
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:29,199
你可真是个软心肠 知道嘛？
Your a real softie. You know that?

518
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:52,764
曼尼？
Manny?

519
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,272
喀什？艾迪？
Crash? Eddie?

520
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:05,589
曼尼？
Manny?

521
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,652
怎么回事？你没事吧？
What's going on? Are you okay?

522
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:31,032
抱歉 我只是想保护你
I'm sorry. I just wanted to keep you safe, and

523
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:34,472
可如今 却害你困在这么危险的地方
Now you're in the most dangerous place in the world.

524
00:56:34,473 --> 00:56:36,210
这又不是你的错
This isn't your fault.

525
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,947
那只恐龙比我们两个加起来还大
It's bigger than both of us.

526
00:56:37,948 --> 00:56:39,687
我们必须去救希德
We have to get, Sid.

527
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,971
嗯 可如果当初我这个朋友
Yeah, but If I had been a better

528
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:45,000
能当得更够格 我们也不会在这儿了
friend to him... we wouldn't be here.

529
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,500
更够格？你开什么国际玩笑？
Better friend? Are you plucking my whiskers?

530
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,869
你冒着你自己 你老婆
You risked your life, your mate

531
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,346
还有你孩子的生命危险 去救你这朋友
and your baby to save your buddy!

532
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,266
或许算不上好丈夫或者好父亲
Not the best husband or father,

533
00:56:56,266 --> 00:56:58,664
可是做朋友…够意思
but... a damn good friend.

534
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,014
大家都停下！
Everybody stop!

535
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:22,497
我闻到点什么
I smell something.

536
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:29,588
嗯 有点像秃鹰的尾毛
Hmm, it smells like a buzzard's butt fell off.

537
00:58:30,213 --> 00:58:31,412
又被一群臭鼬放屁熏了一遍
And then got sprayed on by a bunch of, skunks.

538
00:58:31,412 --> 00:58:32,612
就是希德没错
That's, Sid.

539
00:58:34,072 --> 00:58:36,678
各位 我们找到犯罪现场了！
Mammal's, we have ourselves a crime scene.

540
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:44,499
吃剩下一半的骨头！还有一坨…啊！不妙！
Half eaten carcass! Hunk of...oh, no!

541
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:46,792
菜花！
Broccoli!

542
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,026
我认为事情是这样的：恐龙袭击希德
Here's what I think happened: Dinosaur attacked Sid,

543
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,215
希德 用菜花反抗
Sid, fights back with piece of broccoli.

544
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:57,116
-  最后打成了植物人 - 神经！
- Leaving dinosaur, a vegetable. - Are you nuts?

545
00:58:57,324 --> 00:58:59,930
希德可没那么暴力 也没这本事
Sid's not violent, or co-Ordinated.

546
00:58:59,931 --> 00:59:02,016
对啊 还有 恐龙呢？
Yeah and where's the dinosaur?

547
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:04,101
好了好了 算你们有理
Alright, alright. Good point.

548
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:05,666
场景重现2：
Theory two:

549
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,474
希德在吃菜花
Sid's eating broccoli.

550
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:09,177
恐龙吃掉希德
Dinosaur eats Sid.

551
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:10,880
恐龙踩过菜花
Dinosaur steps on broccoli.

552
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,173
菜花变成一坨 
Leaving broccoli, a vegetable.

553
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,467
巴克 你什么时候开始秀逗的？
Buck, when exactly did you lose your mind?

554
00:59:15,572 --> 00:59:17,022
呃…三个月前
Umm... 3 months ago.

555
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:20,472
我一觉醒来 发现自己和一个菠萝结婚了
I woke up one morning married to a pineapple.

556
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,601
还是一只巨丑无比的菠萝
An *UGLY* pineapple.

557
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,833
- 可我还是爱它 - 呃 巴克
- But I loved her. - Uh, Buck!

558
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:29,648
这边你好像漏了点线索
I think you missed a little clue over here.

559
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:34,861
你朋友或许还活着，可也活不久 
Your friend might be alive. But not for long.

560
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:38,615
鲁迪越来越近了
 Rudy's closing in.

561
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,659
哇…
Wow...

562
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,317
明白了吧 “惊呼之地” 哇
You got it. The plates of, wow.

563
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,393
或者随便拿这里剩下的玩意取个名儿
Or whatever's left of them.

564
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:59,322
大伙排成一列 朝“熔岩瀑布”进发
Single file everyone. Head for, Lava Falls.

565
01:01:11,313 --> 01:01:16,005
- 什么声音？ - 是风 它在和我们说话
- What's that sound? - It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

566
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:20,801
- 它说什么？ - 我不知道 我听不懂
- What's it saying? - I don't know. I don't speak wind.

567
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:29,994
艾莉？
Ellie?

568
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:34,357
我没事 别担心我 只是在…
I'm fine, don't worry about me. I'm just taking my...

569
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,153
艾莉！
Ellie! Whoa!

570
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:45,305
- 曼尼！ - 快跳到旁边岩架上！
