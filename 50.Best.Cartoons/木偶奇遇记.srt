00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:18,140
木偶奇遇记

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,950
当你对着星星许愿
When you wish upon a star

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,170
你是谁并没有区别
Makes no difference who you are

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:47,180
你所期望的任何事物 都会来到你的身边
Anything your heart desires will come to you

6
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,970
如果你的心中充满梦想
If your heart is in your dreams

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,770
没有什么请求 是太过分的
No request is too extreme

8
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,400
当你像个爱做梦的人那样
When you wish upon a star

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,610
对着星星许愿
As dreamers do

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,990
命运是仁慈的
Fate is kind

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,240
她带给
She brings

12
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,790
那些充满爱意的人们
To those who love

13
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,880
满足渴望秘密的
The sweet fulfilment

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,420
甜蜜感觉
Of their secret longing

15
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,800
噢，噢，噢，噢
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

16
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,430
就同突如而来的霹雳一般
Like a boat out of the blue

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,150
命运衡量着罪恶 并且始终注视着你
Fate steps in and sees you through

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:51,620
当你对着星星许愿
When you wish upon a star

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:02:02,420
你的梦想会变为现实
Your dreams come true

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,050
很动听，哦？
Pretty, huh?

21
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,590
我敢打赌有很多人 不相信这些
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that --

22
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,300
一个许愿的实现 你信么？
about a wish coming true -- do you?

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,970
是啊，以前我也不信
Well, I didn't, either.

24
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,850
当然了，我只是一只...
Of course, I'm just a cricket

25
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,930
从一个炉膛唱到另一个炉膛的蟋蟀...
singing my way from hearth to hearth,

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,060
不过... 让我来告诉你们 是什么改变了我的看法
but let me tell you what made me change my mind.

27
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,490
很久以前的一个夜里...
One night a long time a--

28
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,820
抱歉
pardon me.

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,910
等一下 我把这个东西固定到这儿...
Wait till I fix this thing here.

30
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,370
那儿...
There.

31
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,620
很久以前的一个夜里...
One night a long time ago,

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,120
我旅行到了一个 离奇有趣的小村庄
my travels took me to a quaint little village.

33
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,080
那是一个美丽的夜晚
It was a beautiful night.

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,460
星星像钻石一样璀璨...
The stars were shining like diamonds

35
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,300
高高悬挂在沉睡的小镇上空
high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.

36
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,470
像画儿一样美丽
Pretty as a picture.

37
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,310
我漫步在弯弯曲曲的小街上
As I wandered along the crooked streets,

38
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,430
一个人影儿也看不到
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,520
惟一生命的迹象 是一扇亮着灯光的窗
The only sign of life was a Iighted window

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,860
在一个名叫葛派特的木雕家的小店里
in the shop of a woodcarver named Geppetto.

41
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,780
所以，我想
So, I hopped over...

42
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,240
...往店里窥视
...and looked in.

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,830
眼睁睁看着那样一块令人愉快的炭火熄灭 实在是太可惜了
It was a shame to see a nice, cheerful fire going to waste.

44
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,160
所以我该怎么做呢？
So what do I do?

45
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,500
我进了店去
I go in.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,380
环顾四周
I looked around.

47
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,300
当然了，在那样一个奇怪的地方
Of course, being in a strange place like that,

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,600
我不知道会碰到些什么
I didn't know what to expect.

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,770
一只蟋蟀不可能太细心的 你知道的
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.

50
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,940
很快我发现四下无人 原来我独处一室啦
Soon as I saw there was no one about,

51
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,110
我尽量保持镇静
I made myself at home.

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,040
当我站在那里暖和我的…我自己的时候
As I stood there warming my... myself,

53
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,920
我四下打量
I took a look around.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,420
先生们，你们可能从未见过 这样的一个地方...
Well, sir, you never saw such a place --

55
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,590
那可能是你们看到的最奇异的钟表
the most fantastic clocks you ever Iaid your eyes on,

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,060
全部是木头雕成的
and all carved out of wood.

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,180
还有小巧可爱的音乐盒 每一件都是艺术品
And cute, little music boxes -- each one a work of art.

58
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,650
满架满架的玩具和...
And shelf after shelf of toys and...

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,190
接着，一件东西吸引了我
and then something else caught my eye --

60
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,900
一个木偶
a puppet.

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,360
想想看，就是那种牵线木偶
You know -- one of those marionette things.

62
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,740
全是线和关节
AII strings and joints.

63
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,200
可爱的小家伙
Cute little fella.

64
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,880
上去喽？！
going up?!

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,670
还是块好木料
Good piece of wood, too.

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,430
好的，现在
Well, now.

67
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,090
不需要太久啦
It won't take much longer.

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
只要再上点颜料 他就完工啦
Just a little more paint, and he's all finished.

69
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,360
我想他会很棒的 是吗，费加洛？
I think he'll be alright, don't you, Figaro?

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
真对不起
Beg pardon.

71
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,820
看到了？ 这下子大大不同啦
See? That makes a big difference.

72
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,780
太棒了
Very good.

73
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,410
非常，非常（好）...
Very, very g--

74
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,910
噢，你不能取悦所有的人
Well, you can't please everybody.

75
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,670
现在，我要给你取个名字...
Now I have just the name for you --

76
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,970
皮诺曹！
Pinocchio!

77
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,840
喜欢吗，费加洛？
Do you like it, Figaro?

78
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,560
不喜欢？
No?

79
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,350
你喜欢的，不是么，克利奥？
You do, don't you, Cleo?

80
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,600
好吧，我们让小木头脑瓜来决定吧
Well, we'll Ieave it to little wooden head.

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,270
你喜欢这个名字么？
Do you like it?

82
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,530
就这么定了！
That settles it!

83
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,860
它就叫皮诺曹！
Pinocchio it is!

84
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,240
来吧 让我们来试试看
Come on, now! We'll try you out.

85
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,530
音乐，乐师！
Music, Professor!

86
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,970
小心点儿，那儿！
Take it easy, there!

87
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,800
别闹了，好么？
Break it up, will ya?

88
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,260
敲了我这么多下
Lot of downbeats in there.

89
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,980
小小木头脑瓜 活动你的部件
Little wooden head, go play your part

90
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,320
给大伙点乐趣吧
Bring a little joy to every heart

91
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,450
小家伙你知道吗 这可是真的

92
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,370
我真的非常以你为荣
That I'm mighty proud of you

93
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,290
小小木头脚丫 你是最最好的
Little wooden feet and best of all

94
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,080
小小木头屁股 防止你会摔跤
Little wooden seat in case you fall

95
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,420
多优美啊！
How graceful!

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,420
我的小小木头脑瓜
My little wooden head

97
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,130
克利奥，来见见皮诺曹
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.

98
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,840
说，“你好？”
Say, "How do you do? "

99
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,640
来跟费加洛打个招呼
Say hello to Figaro.

100
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,020
这就开始淘气了
Up to mischief already!

101
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,520
你看到发生什么了？
You see what happens?

102
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,840
我们上去啦！
Up we go!

103

真是个可爱的小家伙
You're a cute little fellow.

104
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,050
那个笑容-- 你知道，我--
And that smile -- You know, I --

105
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,060
你这个淘气鬼 妒嫉了哦？
You rascal. Jealous, huh?

106
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,520
你知道么，皮诺曹
You know, Pinocchio,

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,850
我想费加洛正在吃你的醋
I think Figaro is jealous of you.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,780
不要担心，费加洛 我...
Don't worry, Figaro. I --

109
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,780
我想知道什么时候了
I wonder what time it is.

110
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,620
太晚了
It's getting late.

111
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,210
来吧，该睡了
Come now. We go to bed.

晚安，克利奥 我的小小水宝贝

你也得说晚安

116
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,990
去啊
Go on.

117
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,040
现在去睡吧 我的小美人鱼
Now, go to sleep, my little mermaid.

118
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,500
晚安
Good night.

119
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,680
这就是我认为的舒适生活啊
This is my idea of comfort.

120
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,270
实实在在的舒适
Silent comfort.

121
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,330
看看他，费加洛
Look at him, Figaro.

122
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,630
他看起来就像有生命一般
He almost looks alive.

123
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,060
如果他是个真正的男孩 那不是太棒了么？
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?

124
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,520
哦，好吧
Oh, well.

125
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,020
来
Come on.

126
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,360
睡吧
We go to sleep.

127
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,540
我忘了开窗
I forgot to open the window.

128
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,660
噢，费加洛！看！
Oh, Figaro, look!

129
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,160
看啊！许愿星！
Look! A wishing star!

130
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,540
星星明，星星亮 今晚我见到的第一颗星星
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight --

131
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:21,010
我希望我可以，我希望我能 实现今晚我许下的愿望
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish I make tonight.

132
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,430
费加洛，你知道我许了什么愿么？
Figaro, you know what I wish?

133
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,730
我许愿我的小皮诺曹 能成为一个真正的男孩儿
I wish that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy.

134
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,900
那样不是太棒了么？ 想想看！
Wouldn't that be nice? Just think!

135
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,820
一个真正的男孩！
A real boy!

136
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,490
真是个可爱的想法
A very Iovely thought...

137
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,860
只是有点不太现实
but not at all practical.

138
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,740
一个真正的...
A real...

139
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,040
...男孩子
...boy.

140
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,780
安静！
Qulet!

141
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,710
记住，够了
After all, enough's enough.

142
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,300
现在这又怎么了？
Now what's up?

143
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,480
嗨，这儿怎么了？！
Hey! What's going on here?!

144
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,990
像我一样活着的，一位仙女！
As I Iive and breathe -- a fairy!

145
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,540
好心的葛派特
Good Geppetto,

146
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,090
你带给大家这么多的欢乐
you have given so much happiness to others.

147
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,130
你的愿望应该实现
You deserve to have your wish come true.

148
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,180
松木制成的小木偶...
Little puppet made of pine...

149
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,470
醒来吧
wake.

150
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,390
一件礼物...你的生命
The gift of life is thine.

151
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,190
现在还有什么他们不能做的
What they can't do these days.

152
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,490
我能动！
I can move!

153
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,330
我能说话！
I can talk!

154
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,580
我能走路！
I can walk!

155
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,750
是啊，皮诺曹 我给了你生命
Yes, Pinocchio. I've given you life.

156
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,540
为啥哩？
Why?

157
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,460
因为，今晚葛派特许愿 想要个真正的男孩儿
Because tonight Geppetto wished for a real boy.

158
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,880
我是个真正的男孩儿么？
Am I a real boy?

159
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,760
还不是，皮诺曹
No, Pinocchio.

160
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,970
葛派特的愿望能否实现 完全取决于你
To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.

161
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,810
取决于我？
Up to me?

162
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,390
证明你自己是勇敢、诚实和无私的啊
Prove yourself brave, truthful, and unselfish,

163
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,110
总有一天你会变一个真正的男孩子
and someday you will be a real boy.

164
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,730
一个真正的男孩子！
A real boy!

165
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,570
那可不容易
That won't be easy.

166
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,070
你必须学会分辨是非
You must learn to choose between right and wrong.

167
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,610
是与非？
Right and wrong?

168
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,450
可是我怎么才能知道呢？
But how will I know?

169
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,490
他怎么会知道？
How will he know?

170
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,160
你的良心会告诉你啊
Your conscience will tell you.

171
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,740
良心是什么？
What are conscience?

172
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,410
良心是什么？

173
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,160
好吧，让我来告诉你！
Well, I'll tell ya!

174
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,540
良心是那种很安静微弱的声音
A conscience is that still, small voice

175
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,630
人们往往从不理会它
that people won't listen to.

176
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,340
所以现在的世界这么糟糕
That's just the trouble with the world today.

177
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,010
那你是我的良心么？
Are you my conscience?

178
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,630
谁？我？
Who, me?

179
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,390
你愿意当皮诺曹的良心么？
Would you like to be Pinocchio's conscience?

180
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,430
这个，但 我...我...
Well, b-- I -- I --

181
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,680

非常好！
Very well.

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,400
你叫什么名字？
What is your name?

184
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,770
我叫蟋蟀
Cricket's the name.

185
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,440
蟋蟀杰米尼
Jiminy Cricket.

186
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,940
跪下，蟋蟀先生
Kneel, Mr. Cricket.

187
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,280
哦？
Huh?

188
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,120
快点，这可不是开玩笑哦
No tricks, now.

189
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,160
我任命你为 皮诺曹的良心
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience,

190
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,500
明辨是非充满智慧的贵族

遇到诱惑时的顾问

碰到困难险阻时的向导

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,750
起来吧，蟋蟀杰米尼阁下
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

194
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,300
啊！天呐！天呐！
Well! My, my!

195
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,970
不得不说，让我得意洋洋了！
Say, that's pretty swell!

196
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,470
哎呀，多谢
Gee, thanks.

197
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,430
不过，呃，我能不能 有块徽章或者别的什么？
But don't I get a badge or something?

198
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,940
好的，你会看到的
Well, we'll see.

199
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,350
你是说我会有一块么？
You mean maybe I will?

200
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,650
我没意见
I shouldn't wonder.

201
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,900
会是金的吗？
Make it a gold one?

202
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,440
也许吧
Maybe.

203
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,780
现在，记住，皮诺曹 做个好孩子
Now, remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.

204
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,700
让你的良心为你指路
And always let your conscience be your guide.

205
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,160
再见，夫人
Goodbye, milady.

206
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,330
再见！
Goodbye!

207
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,920
不错嘛，我觉得

噢，耶

209
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,170
差点儿忘了你了
AImost forgot about you.

210
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,470
好吧，皮诺曹...
Well, Pinoke...

211
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,350
也许我们应该坦诚得谈谈心
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.

212
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,220
为啥哩？
Why?

213
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,680
嗯，你想成为一个真正的男孩，不是么？
Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?

214
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,770
是啊是啊！
Uh-huh.

215
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,230
好的
Alright.

216
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,900
坐下，孩子
Sit down, son.

217

你看，这个世界充满了诱惑
Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.

诱惑？
Temptations?

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,200
没错...诱惑
Yep -- temptations.

220
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,240
就是说那些看起来是正确的 可是事实上却是错误的东西
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time.

221
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,790
有时候正确的事物
But even though the right things

222
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,120
看起来会像错误的一样 而另一些时候呢...
may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the --

223
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,620
错误的东西又好像是正确的
the wrong things may be right

224
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,960
反之亦然
at the wrong time or vice versa.

225
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,010
明白吗？
Understand?

226
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,430
哦...哦
Unh-unh.

227
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,430
不过我要做正确的事情啊！
But I'm gonna do right!

228
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,350
好孩子，皮诺曹 我也会帮助你的
Attaboy, Pinoke. And I'm gonna help you.

229
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,350
你需要我的时候 看，吹声口哨好了
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle,

230
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,440
就像这样

231
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,690
像这样吗？
Like this?

232
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,980
不，不 再试一次，皮诺曹

这样吗？
Like this?

234
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,320
不，孩子
No, son.

235
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,360
听着
Now, listen.

238
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,080
当你陷入困境
When you get in trouble

239
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,340
不能分清是非
And you don't know right from wrong

240
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,590
轻轻吹声口哨
Give a little whistle

不是吱吱作响
Not just a little squeak

246
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,640
撮起嘴巴来吹
Pucker up and blow

247
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,810
如果你的口哨太轻，就大声喊
And if your whistle's weak, yell

248
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,360
杰米尼.克力克特？ 对啦！

258
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,830
永远让你的良心为你指路
And always let your conscience be your guide

259
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,170
当心，皮诺曹！
Look out, Pinoke!

260
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,050
谁在哪儿？！
Who's there?!

小心！费加洛
Carefully, now, Figaro.

265
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,300
他随时都有可能跳出来

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,230
就在这儿的什么地方
He's in here somewhere.

267
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,650
我在这儿！
Here I am!

268

你怎么跑到下面来了？
How did you get down here?

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,340
是啊
Uh-huh.

272
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,260
不！
No!

273
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,050
是的！ 我还能动呢！
Yes! And I can move, too!

274
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,220
不，不，不！你不能！ 我是在做梦吧！
No, no, no! You can't! I'm dreaming in my sleep!

275
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,980
让我醒过来！ 让我醒过来！
Wake me up! Wake me up!

276
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,570
现在让我们来看看是谁在做梦
Now we see who's dreaming.

277
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,870
继续...说点什么
Go on -- say something.

278
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,920

00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,210
蓝色的仙女？
The blue fairy?

283
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,090
我还得到了一个良心呢！ 一个良心？

284
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,300
而且将来某一天 我会成为一个真正的男孩！

一个真正的男孩！ 那是我的愿望啊！

它成为现实了！

00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,220
费加洛，看啊！
Figaro, look!

来跟费加洛打个招呼

她是我的小小水宝贝 很可爱是不是？

294
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,080

介意我加入么？
Mind if I cut in?

300
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,630
下一支曲子到旁边坐坐怎么样？ 亲爱的，嗯？
How 'bout sittin' out the next one, babe, huh?

301
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,710
哇！让我出去！ 让我出去！

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,340
差一点儿
That was close.

314

在这场伟大的演出即将结束之际
to conclude the performance of this great show,

467
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,320
斯特隆波里，马戏团的老板...
Stromboli the Master Showman --

468
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,360
就是我
that's me --

469
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,280
得到管理者的特别许可...
and by special permission of the management --

470
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,240
也是我...
that's me, too --

471
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,160
为您介绍...
is presenting to you

472
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,290
一件您绝对难以相信的东西
something you will absolutely refuse to believe.

473
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,710
啊，看起来座无虚席啊
Well, looks like a sellout.

474
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,590
有请...
Introducing...

475
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,260
这个绝无仅有的能歌会舞的木偶
the only marionette who can sing and dance

476
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,680
完全没有线牵引着
absolutely without the aids of strings!

477
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:29,230
独一无二的皮诺曹！
The one-and-only Pinocchio!

478
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,070
就吹吧！
What a buildup.

479
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,120
没有线绳系着我
I've got no strings to hold me d--

480
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,090
继续啊，把自己当白痴
Go ahead. Make a fool of yourself.

481
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,590
那样也许你就能听从你的良心了
Then maybe you'll listen to your conscience.

482
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,860
没有线绳系着我
I've got no strings to hold me down

483
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,650
来让我烦恼 让我皱眉
To make me fret or make me frown

484
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,110
我曾经有线 而现在是自由的
I had strings, but now I'm free

485
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,700
我的身上没有线
There are no strings on me

486
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,320
开开心心
Heigh-ho the merry-o

487
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,120
那是最好的方式
That's the only way to be

488
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,120
想让这个世界知道 没什么能让我忧虑
I want the world to know nothing ever worries me

489
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,290
我没有牵线 所以很开心
I've got no strings, so I have fun

490
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,960
我告诉过你什么来着，嗯？！
What I told you, huh?!

491
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,470
他们有牵线 可是你能看到
They've got strings, but you can see

492
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,180
我的身上没有线
There are no strings on me

493
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,440
你没有牵线 你的胳膊是自由的
You have no strings, your arms is free

494
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,900
爱我就在须德海（荷兰）
To love me by the Zuider Zee

495
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,230
如果你可以
If you would woo

496
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
我把我的线给你
I'd bust my strings for you

497
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,460
你没有牵线
You've got no strings, comme ci, comme ca

498
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,920
你的机敏
Your savoir-faire is ooh la la

499
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,590
我有牵线 可是你知我知（法语）
I've got strings, but entre nous

500
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,720
我把我的线割给你
I'd cut my strings for you

501
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,860
沿着伏尔加河向下走
Down where the Volga flows

502
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,950
有个约会的好地方
There's a Russian rendezvous

503
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,160
我本要和伊凡去
Where me and Ivan go

504
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,040
可我宁愿跟你走
But I'd rather go with you

505
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,610
我的身上没有线
There are no strings on me

506
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,580
他们喜欢他
They like him.

507
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,380
他成功了
He's a success.

508
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,800
上帝，也许我错了
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.

509
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,310
好吧...
Well...

510
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,350
我想他再也不需要我了
guess he won't need me anymore.

511
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,980
演员还要良心做什么呢？
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?

512
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,410
接下来会发生什么呢？
What could have happened to him?

513
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,170
都这时候了他会在哪儿呢？
Where could he be at this hour?

514
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,170
我最好再出去找找他
I'd better go out again and look for him.

515
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,340
记住...
And remember --

516
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,550
在我找到他之前，一口也不许吃
nobody eats a bite... until I find him.

517
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,080
我没有线 可我有头脑
I got no strings, but I got the brain

518
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,330
我没有线 可我有头脑
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane

519
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,170
我买套新衣服 我转着链子

520
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,500
我吃着最好的 我喝着香槟酒
I eat the best and I drink champagne

521
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,800
我的身上没有线
I got no strings on me

522
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,090
太棒了，皮诺曹！
Bravo, Pinocchio!

523
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,340
他们喜欢我
They liked me.

524
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,300
两百

525
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,430
你太让人感动了！
You are sensational!

526
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,680
是说我很棒？
You mean I'm good?

527
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,810
三百
300.

528
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,110
你真伟大！
You are colossal!

529
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,400
就是说，我是个演员了？
Does that mean I'm an actor?

530
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,200
当然！我要把你介绍给大家！
Sure! I will push you in the public's eye!

531
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,780
你的脸蛋...会成为每个人的话题
Your face -- she will be on everybody's tongue!

532
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,410
会么？
Will she?

533
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,080
当然，嗯？
Yeah. Huh?

534
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
这是什么？！
What's this?!

535
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,890
给你的，我的小皮诺曹
For you, my little Pinocchio.

536
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,430
给我的？耶，谢谢！
For me? Gee, thanks!

537
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,720
我现在就回家告诉我爸爸
I'll run right home and tell my father.

538
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,850
家？
Home?

539
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,900
哦，当然！
Oh, sure!

540
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,650
回家找你爸爸！
Going home to your father!

541
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,940
哦，太滑稽了！
Oh, that is very comical!

542
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,320
你是说很好笑？
You mean it's funny?

543
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,030
当然！
Sure!

544
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,780
我早晨回来
I'll be back in the morning.

545
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,030

548
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,420
这里将是你的家！
This will be your home!

549
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,920
这样我才能随时找到你
Where I can find you always.

550
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,720
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

551
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,300
对！对！对！
Yes! Yes! Yes!

552
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,390
你是属于我的
To me...you are belonging.

553
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,020
我们要环游世界
We will tour the world.

不！不！
No! No!

559

对！
Yes!

560
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,490
我们今晚就走！
We start tonight!

561
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,410
你会挣一大笔钱...
You will make lots of money...

562
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,830
给我！
for me!

563
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,710
等你老的不能动的时候
And when you are growing too old,

564
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,380
你会成为上好的...
you will make good...

565
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,260
木柴！
firewood!

566
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,140
让我出去！
Let me out of here!

567
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,140
我要出去！ 你不能...
I gotta get out! You can't --

568
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,930
安静！
Qulet!

569
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,310
闭嘴 在我把你敲傻之前
Shut up before I knock you silly!

570
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,520
晚安...
Good night...

571
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,400
...我的木头小金矿
...my little wooden gold mine.

572
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,950
不！不，等等！
No! No, wait!

573
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,450
放我出去！ 我要告诉我爸爸！
Let me out! I'll tell my father!

574

杰米尼！你在哪儿？！
Jiminy, where are you?!

576
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,350
哦，他去了...
Well, there he goes --

577
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,230
坐在华贵的腿上 世界在他的脚下
sitting in the Iap of Iuxury, the world at his feet.

578
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,150
哦，好吧，我只能说我总是了解他的
Oh, well, I can always say I knew him when.

579
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,030
我将静静地走出他的生活
I'll just go out of his life quietly.

580
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,370
尽管这样，我还是祝他好运
I would like to wish him luck, though.

581
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,830
当然！为什么不呢？
Sure. Why not?

582
00:44:59,426 --> 00:45:02,136
皮诺曹
Pinocchio

583
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:04,136
皮诺曹
Pinocchio

584
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:07,136
是我...你的老朋友 杰米尼，记得么？
It's me -- your old friend Jiminy, remember?

585
00:45:07,216 --> 00:45:10,426
杰米尼！见到你我太高兴了！
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!

586
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:11,896
皮诺曹
Pinocchio

587
00:45:12,016 --> 00:45:13,306
发生了什么事？！
What's happened?!

588
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:16,096
他对你做了些什么？
What did he do to you?

589
00:45:16,186 --> 00:45:17,186
噢！他疯了！
Oh, he was mad!

590
00:45:17,266 --> 00:45:19,936
他说他要把我介绍给大家！
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye!

591
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:22,316
只是因为我是块金砖
And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick,

592
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:24,566
他要把我剁成木柴！
he's gonna chop me into firewood!

593
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:26,236
哦，是这样吗？
Oh, is that so?

594
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,406
现在，不要担心，孩子
Now, don't you worry, son.

595
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:30,786
我马上就把你弄出来
I'll have you out of here in no time at all.

596
00:45:31,906 --> 00:45:35,576
呃，容易的只要转几下...
Why, this is just as easy as rolling off a...

597
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,426
有点锈住了
Kinda rusty.

598
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,256
得上点油
Needs a little oil.

599
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:56,556
对，没错
Well, that's what I said.

600
00:46:06,606 --> 00:46:08,906
肯定是老式的锁
Must be one of the old models.

601
00:46:08,986 --> 00:46:11,366
你是说，你打不开它吗？
You mean you can't open it?

602
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:12,696
是的
Yeah.

603
00:46:14,446 --> 00:46:16,996
看起来没希望了
Looks pretty hopeless.

604
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:19,246
会有奇迹出现来救我们出去的
It'll take a miracle to get us out of here.

605
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:20,996
哎...
Gee...

606
00:47:00,786 --> 00:47:04,086
我是一个好良心
A fine conscience I turned out to be.

607
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:06,586
我早该听你的话的，杰米尼
I should've listened to you, Jiminy.

608
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,836
不，是我的错
No. It was my fault.

609
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:10,886
我不该离开你的
I shouldn't have walked out on you.

610
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:13,966
我想我再也见不到我爸爸了
Guess I'll never see my father again.

611
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:17,926
振作起来，孩子
Oh, buck up, son.

612
00:47:18,016 --> 00:47:19,636
还有更糟糕的
It could be worse.

613
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:21,436
高兴一点儿...
Be cheerful...

614
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:22,856
就像我！
like me!

615
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:32,196
别紧张，孩子
Take it easy, son.

616
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,526
来...擤
Come on -- blow.

617
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:37,576
好样的
Attaboy.

618
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:43,286
噢，太好了...
Oh, well...

619
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:44,956
总之不下雨了
It stopped raining, anyway.

620
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,206
嗨！又是那颗星星！
Hey, that star again!

621
00:47:48,296 --> 00:47:49,256
那位女士！
The lady!

622
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:51,676
仙女！
The fairy!

623
00:47:51,756 --> 00:47:53,886
她会说什么？
What'll she say?

呃，这真是一个愉快的惊喜

630
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:19,786
皮诺曹，你为什么没去上学？
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?

631
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:20,826
上学？
School?

632
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:24,826

633
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:27,836
我本来是打算去上学的 可后来我遇到些人

它们有大大的绿色的眼睛

637
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:37,006
为什么...

638
00:48:37,096 --> 00:48:40,266
妖怪？ 你不害怕么？
Monsters? Weren't you afraid?

639
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:42,936
不，仙女 可是他们把我装进了大袋子里
No, ma'am, but they tied me in a big sack.

640
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:47,146
你没说实话！
You don't say!

641
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:48,856
那么，杰米尼先生当时在哪儿呢？

哦，杰米尼？
Oh. Jiminy?

643
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:53,646

它们把他装进了一个小袋子里
They put him in a little sack.

645
00:48:56,156 --> 00:48:57,486
不！

647
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:01,996
- 那你是怎么逃脱的呢？ - 我没能
-- How did you escape? -- I didn't.

648

他们把我砍了做柴火！

649
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:10,546
噢！噢，看啊！ 我的鼻子！
Oh! Oh, look! My nose!

650
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:12,256
怎么回事？
What's happened?

651
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:14,546
也许你没有说实话，皮诺曹
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio.

652
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,796
- 也许？ - 哦，可是我说了实话
-- Perhaps? -- Oh, but I have.

653

噢，请帮帮我！ 真是太抱歉了
Oh, please, help me. I'm awful sorry.

655
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:30,436
你看，皮诺曹 谎言就这样越说越大...
You see, Pinocchio, a Iie keeps growing and growing

656
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:33,436
直到它跟你的鼻子一样的明显
until it's as plain as the nose on your face.

657
00:49:33,526 --> 00:49:35,906
她是对的，皮诺曹 你最好还是全招了
She's right, Pinoke. You better come clean.

658
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:39,066
我以后再也不撒谎了 我说实话，不再说谎
I'll never Iie again -- honest, I won't.

给我个面子，好吗？ 嗯？

这次我就饶恕你 不过，你记住
I'll forgive you this once, but remember --

664
00:49:51,046 --> 00:49:52,876
一个坏孩子
a boy who won't be good

665
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,716
还是乖乖地当他的木头人吧
might just as well be made of wood.

666
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:58,136
我们会好的，不是么？
We'll be good, won't we?

667
00:49:58,216 --> 00:50:01,926
很好，但这是我最后一次帮你们

每天都是假日
Where every day is a holiday

780
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:40,096
孩子们除了玩还是玩

791
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:25,436
可以把那地儿砸了 也没人说一句话
You can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word.

792
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:26,896
诚实的约翰给的我...
Honest John gave me --

802
00:57:28,456 --> 00:57:31,086
这里是你能见到的最粗暴的地方

进来打一架吧，孩子们！

为啥哩？
Why?

807
00:57:38,216 --> 00:57:39,806
啊，就是玩儿
Aw, just for the fun of it.

好的，朗威
Okay, Lampy.

00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:45,686
烟草之路！ 烟草之路！
Tobacco row! Tobacco row!

拿你的雪茄、香烟和嚼烟

进来抽几根吧

一些...全部都是骗人的
There's something...phoney about all this.

814
00:57:57,656 --> 00:57:59,656
我得把他从这儿带走
I've gotta get him outta here.

815
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:00,656
快点，快点，快点！
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

816
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:03,406
快点！看那个模型屋子 它是专门为毁坏而建的
See the model home. It's open for destruction.

现在是你们的了，孩子们！ 全是你们的了！
And it's all yours, boys! It's all yours!

818
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:14,666
我说什么来着？ 这地儿难道不是棒极了么？
What'd I tell ya? Ain't this a swell joint?

819
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:17,966
是啊！做坏事真好玩儿，是不是？
Yeah! Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?

820
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:19,636
是啊
Yeah.

821

00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:34,356
关上门 把它们锁紧！
Shut the doors and Iock 'em tight!

825
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:37,736
让他们做好准备
Now get below and get them crates ready.

826
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,736
让坏孩子们为所欲为
Give a bad boy enough rope,

827
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:43,696
不久他们就会变成驴子
and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.

828
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:02,466
人都哪儿去了？
Where is everybody?

829
00:59:05,176 --> 00:59:07,846
这地方像个墓地
Place is like a graveyard.

830
00:59:07,936 --> 00:59:09,976
我不喜欢这地方
I don't like the looks of this.

831
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:17,986
嗨，你在哪儿？
Hey, where are you?!

832
00:59:34,546 --> 00:59:37,466
你觉得人都去哪儿了，朗威？
Where do you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick?

833
00:59:37,546 --> 00:59:41,086
啊，他们就在这附近 管他呢！
They're around here somewheres. What do you care?

834
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,136
你玩的很开心 是不是？
You're having a good time, ain't ya?

835
00:59:45,216 --> 00:59:47,766
是啊，的确是
Uh-huh. I sure am.

836
00:59:47,846 --> 00:59:51,146
哦，哥儿们 这就是生活，嗯，皮诺曹？
Oh, boy. This is the life, huh, Pinokey?

837
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:52,266
是的
Yeah.

838
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,476
确实是
It sure is.

839
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:59,526
哈！你吸烟的样子像我祖母！
Ah, you smoke like my grandmother.

840
00:59:59,606 --> 01:00:02,026
来，像这样来口大的！
Come on, take a big drag!

841
01:00:02,106 --> 01:00:03,276
这样
Like this.

842
01:00:05,826 --> 01:00:08,156
好的，朗威
Okay, Lampy.

843
01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:28,516
有意思吧，呃？
Some fun, huh, kid?

844
01:00:28,596 --> 01:00:31,386
好的，瘦子，该你了
Okay, Slats, your shot.

845
01:00:45,826 --> 01:00:49,156
怎么了，瘦子？ 抓不牢了？
What's the matter, Slats? Losing your grip?

846
01:00:53,576 --> 01:00:55,626
我竟然在这里找到了你！
So this is where I find you!

847
01:00:55,706 --> 01:00:57,796
你不是曾经期望自己是个真正的男孩么？
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?!

848
01:00:57,876 --> 01:01:01,166
看看你自己，抽烟！
Look at yourself -- smokin'!

849
01:01:01,256 --> 01:01:02,216
玩撞球！
Playing pool!

你现在立刻就得跟我回家！
You're coming right home with me this minute!

851
01:01:04,636 --> 01:01:08,176
嗨！这个甲虫是谁？
Hey...who's the beetle?

852
01:01:08,256 --> 01:01:09,216
把我放下来！
Put me down!

853
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:11,846
他是我的良心
He's my conscience.

854
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:14,016
他告诉我什么是对和错
He tells me what's right and wrong.

855
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:15,596
什么？！
What?!

856
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:18,396
你是说你听令于一只蚱蜢？
You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?!

857
01:01:18,476 --> 01:01:19,776
蚱蜢？
Grasshopper?!

858
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:21,896
看这儿，你 你这个放肆的小畜牲！
Look here, you -- you ignorant young pup!

859
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:24,696
你就不会受到伤害 如果你听令于你的蚱蜢...
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshop--

860
01:01:24,776 --> 01:01:26,906
呃，呃，你的良心 如果你有的话
er, er, your conscience... if you have one.

861
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:28,486
是的，是的，当然了
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

862
01:01:28,576 --> 01:01:30,156
曲线球到角袋
Screwball in the corner pocket.

863
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:44,176
为什么 为什么！你这个小恶棍！
Why -- why, you young hoodlum,

864
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:47,046
我要 我要痛打你一顿！

为什么，我要好好修理你！
Why, I'll take you apart and put you back together!

866
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:57,186
噢，不要伤害他，杰米尼 他是我最好的朋友
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy. He's my best friend.

为什么，我要 你最好的朋友？！
Why, I'll -- your best friend?!

868
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:05,276
那我是什么？ 仅仅是你的良心？
And what am I? Just your conscience.

869
01:02:05,356 --> 01:02:09,026
好吧，就这么定了
Okay, that settles it.

870
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,276
可是，杰米尼...
But, Jiminy --

871
01:02:10,366 --> 01:02:12,996
你给面包涂了黄油 现在就睡在里面吧
You buttered your bread. Now sleep in it!

872
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:25,126
继续，笑啊！ 把自己变成一头驴！
Go on, laugh! Make a jackass outta yourself!

873
01:02:25,216 --> 01:02:26,926
我受够了，到此为止
I am through! This is the end.

874
01:02:27,006 --> 01:02:28,506
可是，杰米尼...
But, Jiminy...

875
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:31,056
朗威说一个人只能活一次
Lampwick says a guy only Iives once.

876
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:36,726
行啦！行啦！ 让他走吧！

877
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:44,736
我发怒了
Burns me up.

878
01:02:44,816 --> 01:02:47,276
毕竟我是尽力为他好的
After all I tried to do for him.

879
01:02:47,356 --> 01:02:49,736
到底谁才是他的良心...
Who's his conscience anyway --

880
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:52,486
是我，还是那个无赖朗威？
me or that hoodlum Lampwick?

881
01:02:52,576 --> 01:02:53,906
我受够了
I've had enough of this.

882
01:02:53,986 --> 01:02:55,826
我要乘下一班船离开这里
I'm taking the next boat outta here.

动起来 我们没有一整夜的时间
Lively there now. We haven't got all night!

887
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:18,226
这些驴子从哪儿来的？
Where'd all the donkeys come from?

888
01:03:18,306 --> 01:03:20,856
赶快！快点！ 再来一个

你们这群孩子玩够了 现在是回报的时候了
You boys have had your fun, now pay for it!

905
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:03,306
孩子？

906
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:05,266
所以那就是为什么...
So that's wh--

01:04:08,146 --> 01:04:10,106
听那个甲虫说话...
Hear that beetle talk...

908

你认为我们会出点什么事
you'd think something was gonna happen to us.

909
01:04:18,786 --> 01:04:21,536
良心 哎，失望！
Conscience. Ah, phooey!

01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:32,966
“你不是曾经期望自己是个真正的男孩么？”
"How do ya ever expect to be a real boy?"

912
01:04:33,046 --> 01:04:35,176
他以为我像什么？公驴...
What's he think I look like --

913
01:04:35,256 --> 01:04:36,636
一头驴子？

嗨，你笑起来像头驴子
Hey, you laugh like a donkey!

妈妈！
Mama!

928
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:25,436
妈妈！

929
01:05:40,906 --> 01:05:42,906
噢，发生什么了？！
Oh! What's happened?!

930
01:05:42,996 --> 01:05:45,076
希望还不会太迟！
I hope I'm not too late!

931
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,246
我该怎么办？
What'll I do?!

932
01:05:53,506 --> 01:05:55,376
杰米尼！ 噢，杰米尼，救命！
Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!

933
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:57,676
等一下，皮诺曹！ 那群孩子！那群孩子！

They're all donkeys!

935
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:01,056
你也是！

936
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:03,476
来吧，快！ 趁你还没变的更糟
Come on, quick! Before you get any worse!

937
01:06:05,056 --> 01:06:08,106
这边，皮诺曹 这是唯一的出路
This way, Pinoke! It's the only way out!

938
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:19,656
快点跑 趁他们还没有发现我们
Hurry up... before they see us!

939
01:06:21,406 --> 01:06:23,536
你得跳！
You gotta jump!

940
01:06:46,806 --> 01:06:49,016
你没事吧？
You alright?

941
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:50,356
当然
Sure.

942
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:52,726
我还以为我们做不到
I thought we'd never make it.

943
01:06:54,146 --> 01:06:57,066
这种感觉真好 回到了...
Certainly feels good to be back on...

944
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,526
干燥的陆地
dry Iand.

945
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:02,616
来吧，我们回家
Come on. Let's get home.

946

爸爸！ 爸爸！我回来了！

949
01:07:11,286 --> 01:07:14,296
他回来了，葛派特先生！ 终于回来了

950

951
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:23,756

他不在这儿
He ain't here.

他走了
He's gone.

956

是啊，还有费加洛
Yeah, and Figaro.

957
01:07:36,146 --> 01:07:38,776
克利奥也一样
And Cleo, too.

958
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:45,536
也许发生了什么可怕的事
Maybe something awful happened to him.

959
01:07:45,616 --> 01:07:49,416
别担心，孩子 他也许没有走远
Don't worry, son. He probably hasn't gone far.

960
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:00,466
有个留言
It's a message.

961
01:08:00,546 --> 01:08:01,586

他在哪儿？
Where is he?

怎么，说他...
Why, it says here he --

965
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:10,346
他出去找你 被鲸鱼吞了
he went looking for you, and he was swallowed by a whale.

966
01:08:10,436 --> 01:08:11,686
被鲸鱼吞了？！
Swallowed by a whale?!

967

01:08:17,896 --> 01:08:19,696
呃，等一下 他还活着
But wait. He's alive.

971
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:21,106
活着？在哪儿？
AIive? Where?

972
01:08:21,196 --> 01:08:24,366
在鲸鱼肚子里 在海底
Inside the whale at the bottom of the sea.

973
01:08:24,446 --> 01:08:26,366
海底？！
Bottom of the sea?!

我要去找他！
I'm going to find him!

976
01:08:30,496 --> 01:08:32,666
可是，皮诺曹，你疯了么？
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?!

977
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:35,286
难道你没明白 他在鲸鱼的肚子里？
Don't you realise he's in a whale?

978
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,046
我要去找他
I gotta go to him.

979
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:39,046
嗨，皮诺曹，等等！
Hey, Pinoke! Wait!

980
01:08:39,126 --> 01:08:41,046
听着，孩子！
Listen here, son!

981
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:46,756
可是，这个怪物 我听说过它的
But this Monstro -- I've heard of him.

982
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:48,386
它是鲸鱼中的鲸鱼
He's a whale of a whale!

983
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:50,806
因为，它能生吞整艘大船
Why, he swallows whole ships alive!

984
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:52,596
系的好一点紧一点
Tie it good and tight, now.

985
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:55,226
还有，很危险的 为什么，我...
And besides, it's dangerous. Why, I --

986
01:08:55,306 --> 01:08:56,566
再见了，杰米尼
Bye, Jiminy.

987
01:08:56,646 --> 01:08:57,526
再见？
Goodbye?

988
01:08:57,606 --> 01:09:00,896
也许我会变成活鱼饵 但是我要和你在一起，来吧

让一下，小姐

01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:55,706
好啦，再会
Well, so long.

997
01:10:01,206 --> 01:10:03,216
方向错了
Put it in the wrong end.

998
01:10:08,546 --> 01:10:12,096
在金鱼面前都没有隐私了
No more privacy than a goldfish.

999
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:15,306
哦，好冷！
Ooh, chilly!

1000
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:21,396

他不是我父亲

1006
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:52,346
葛派特先生！
Mr. Geppetto!

走开，你这个小...喷水器
Run along you little... squirt.

1010
01:11:01,766 --> 01:11:05,356
怎么了，孩子？ 我只是...
What's the matter, kid? I was only --

1011
01:11:05,436 --> 01:11:08,526
我们只是在找怪物
We were only looking for Monstro.

1012
01:11:10,196 --> 01:11:11,736
吓着她们了
That got 'em.

01:11:12,866 --> 01:11:15,036
爸爸！

01:11:35,636 --> 01:11:38,686
你能告诉我们在哪儿能找到怪物吗？
Can you tell me where we can find Monstro?

1017
01:11:38,766 --> 01:11:40,346
你能吗？
Will ya?

1018
01:11:40,436 --> 01:11:44,066
他们很害怕
Gee. They're scared.

1019
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:49,566
呃，请原谅，珍珠
Pardon me, Pearl.

1020
01:11:51,366 --> 01:11:54,486
你知道怪物吗，那只鲸鱼？
Are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale?

1021
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,086
哦，在那儿别动
Whoa, hold it, there.

1022
01:12:12,046 --> 01:12:14,256
爸爸！
Father!

1023
01:12:17,516 --> 01:12:19,476
让一下，孩子
One side there, son.

1024
01:12:19,556 --> 01:12:21,556
好啦，孩子们，松开手
Come on, boys, break it up.

1025
01:12:21,646 --> 01:12:23,106
马上松手
Break it up, now.

1026
01:12:26,186 --> 01:12:28,276
嗨，怎么回事...

别挤我啊
Quit shoving, now.

01:12:31,196 --> 01:12:32,656
别...
Don't --

1029

别紧张 放轻松点
Take it easy. Take it easy, there.

1030
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:46,586
就在那里，内尔
Steady there, Nellie.

1031
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:48,626
快过去皮诺曹，问问他们
Go ahead, Pinoke. Ask them.

1032
01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:53,086
你们有谁能告诉我 怪物在哪儿吗？

谢谢

爸爸！

1036
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:10,896
葛派特先生！
Mr. Geppetto!

1037
01:13:50,276 --> 01:13:54,196
好几天没吃东西了
Not a bite for days.

1038
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:04,616
我们坚持不了多久了
We can't hold out much longer.

1039
01:14:11,456 --> 01:14:13,716
我从没想到
I never thought

1040
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:17,086
会以这样结束，费加洛
it would end this way, Figaro --

1041
01:14:18,596 --> 01:14:21,136
饿死...
starving to death...

1042
01:14:21,266 --> 01:14:25,306
在鲸鱼的胃里
in the belly of a whale.

1043
01:14:25,386 --> 01:14:29,316
我可怜的小皮诺曹
My poor little Pinocchio.

1044
01:14:29,436 --> 01:14:34,106
那么好的一个孩子
He was such a good boy.

1045
01:14:34,196 --> 01:14:36,356
没希望了，费加洛
It's hopeless, Figaro.

1046
01:14:41,576 --> 01:14:45,076
一条鱼也没有了
There isn't a fish Ieft.

1047
01:14:45,156 --> 01:14:48,416
如果怪物还不快醒的话，我...
If the monster doesn't wake up soon, I --

1048
01:14:48,496 --> 01:14:52,046
恐怕我们就不行了
I'm afraid we are done for.

1049
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:13,726
它们来了！
Here they come!

1050
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:18,736
金枪鱼！金枪鱼！
Tuna! Tuna fish!

食物！有得吃了！
Food! We'll eat!

1052
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:27,576
一条大家伙！
Here's a big one.

1053
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:31,586
让它们呆在那里，费加洛！
Get them in there, Figaro!

1054
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,916
等一下！
Wait!

1055
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,666
等一下！ 你们见过...
Wait a minute! Have you seen --

1056
01:15:42,296 --> 01:15:44,886
噢，我们得离开这里！
Oh, we gotta get out of here!

1057
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:55,936
加油啊，皮诺曹 别等我了！
Come on, Pinoke, don't wait for me!

1058
01:15:56,936 --> 01:15:59,316
从没见到过这么多！
Never saw so many!

1059
01:16:07,076 --> 01:16:08,996
还有一条！
Here's another one!

1060
01:16:09,076 --> 01:16:11,956

一条大的
Here's a big one.

1062
01:16:21,836 --> 01:16:24,306
别让它们跑了费加洛！
Keep them in there, Figaro!

1063
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,626
嗨，鲸鱼的大嘴巴，快张开！
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!

1064
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:01,376
我要进去！
I gotta get in there!

1065
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:01,426
我要进去！
It looks like the last of them.

1066
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:01,929
看起来是最后的一些了

1067
01:17:08,176 --> 01:17:12,646
这有一条大的！ 剩下的不多了！

现在别打扰我，皮诺曹！
Don't bother me now, Pinocchio!

1074
01:17:25,946 --> 01:17:26,866

1075
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:29,576

我甚至建了一只木筏

木筏？
A raft?

不，不，不，不 听着，儿子

只有在进食的时候它才张开嘴

所有东西都进来了

1118

希望渺茫，皮诺曹
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

来，燃上一堆火 我们可以把一些鱼煮了来吃

出去？怎么出去？
Getting out? But how?

哦，这会让他发疯的！

好了，是时候了！

1136
01:20:33,386 --> 01:20:34,966
那样不行的！
It won't work!
