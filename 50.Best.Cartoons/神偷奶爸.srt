好吧 我当时还不想说
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you\nabout this yet,

101
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,420
其实我正在策划一项大工程!
but I have been working\non something very big!

102
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,710
金字塔那事跟它根本没法比!

我们查到一间秘密实验室里
Now, we have located a shrink ray

108
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,110
藏着缩小射线 只要我们把它到手
in a secret lab,\nand once we take this shrink ray,

109
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,610
我们就能够

110
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,650
犯下真正意义上的世纪大案
to pull off the true crime\nof the century.

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,850
月球!

118
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,900
一旦月球落到我手里
And once the moon is mine,

119
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,700
想要我交出来的话\n整个世界都得满足我的任何条件!
the world will give me\nwhatever I want to get it back!

120
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,130
而我就会成为前无古人\n后无来者的超级大坏蛋!

我们可没那么多钱玩这个

125
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,020
根本就不可行 我可创造不了奇迹
It can't be done.\nI'm not a miracle worker.

126
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,090

不行

我们太无聊了 这里是干嘛用的?
We got bored.\nWhat is this place?

408
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,120
这个我能喝吗?
Can I drink this?

409
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,670
你想玩自爆吗?
Do you want to explode?

410
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,330
Gru!

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,720
我真正的身份是间谍
In real life, I am a spy.

418
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,400
这是最高机密 你们不可以跟任何人说
And it is top secret,\nand you may not tell anybody,

419
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,570
- 因为如果你们说了...\n- 这是用来做什么的?

你得把它修好

修? 它已经化成灰了\n也就是说 它不可能修好了
Fix it? Look,\nit has been disintegrated.\nBy definition, it cannot be fixed.

424
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,710
别吓我 她这是要干嘛?
That's freaking me out.\nWhat is she doing?

425

她会一直摒着气 直到给她个新独角兽
She's gonna hold her breath\nuntil she gets a new one.

426

00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,150
好啦 好啦 我会把它修好

你要知道
Just so you know,

444
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,290
你永远都不会成为我爸爸
you're never gonna be my dad.

445
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,950
我不会介意的
I think I can live with that.

446
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,460
这些床是用炸弹做的吗?
Are these beds\nmade out of bombs?

447
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,170
没错 不过它们已经老得不可能爆炸了
Yes, but they are very old\nand highly unlikely to blow up.

448
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,130
不过还是不要翻来翻去的
But try not to toss and turn.

449
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,330

你知道这是什么意思吗 教授?
Do you know what that means,\nprofessor?

564
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,010
意思就是 你得不到那个独角兽!
It means you don't get\nthe unicorn!

565
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,010
某人的脸很难看哦
Somebody's got a frowny face.

566
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,500
好怕怕! 下次好运

567
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,440
好了 我来
Okay, my turn.

We have 12 days\nuntil the moon is in optimum position.

578
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,870

我们能点厚底披萨吗?
Can we get stuffed crust?

598
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:33,990
- 厚底披萨!\n- 厚底披萨!
- Stuffed crust!\n- Stuffed crust!

599
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,660
我要把你们全包进面皮里
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

600
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,030
你好好笑!
You're funny!

601
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,870
别再踏出那房间一步了!
Just don't come out of that room\nagain!

602
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,450
好了
All right.

603
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,790
不好意思 刚刚说到哪儿了
Sorry about that.\nWhere were we?

604
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,460
你坐在马桶上
You were sitting on the toilet.

605
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,090
不 不 不 不是 抱歉\n那只是我小幽默一下
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.\nIt was a little attempt at humor.

606
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,970
我知道你超爱笑的...
I know how much you like to laugh

607
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,270
你 内心深处\n现在 我要说的是...
inside. Now, I was saying...

608
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,820
看来你精力不太集中 Gru
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

609
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,280
相信我 我绝对全神贯注
Believe me,\nI am completely focused.

610
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,370
- 你好!\n- 什么?
- Hello!\n- What?

611
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,620
这有个巨人!
That guy is huge!

612
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,120
- 我们上电视了吗?\n- 那是什么? 哪来的孩子?
- Are we on TV?\n- What are those? Children?

613
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,000
你们又要干嘛? 跟你们说了别过来!
What are you doing?\nI told you to stay out of here!

614
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,460
不要!
No, no, no!

615
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:26,580
冰冻射线!
Freeze ray!

616
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,300
Gru先生?
Mr. Gru?

617
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,350
好的
Okay.

618
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,100
我刚才说...
As I was saying...

619
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,020
别说了 够了
No need to continue.\nI've seen quite enough.

620
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,480
- 但是我的计划...\n- 很好
- But my plan...\n- Is a great plan.

621
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,740
计划很好 美中不足的
I love everything about your plan,\nexcept for one thing.

622
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,950
是你
You.

623
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,780
看 妈妈 我画了张自己登月的画!
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me\nlanding on the moon!

624
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,910
看 妈妈 我用通心粉做了个微型火箭!
Look, Mom, I made a prototype\nof the rocket out of macaroni!

625
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:09,920
妈妈\n我照着通心粉火箭模型造了个真家伙!
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket\nbased on the macaroni prototype!

626
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,930
我不明白
I don't understand.

627
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,560
面对现实吧 Gru
Let's face reality, Gru.

628
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,400
这个计划你已经跟进这么久了\n却没取得什么进展
You've been at this for far too long\nwith far too little success.

629
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,820
所以银行决定 转而投资...
We're gonna put our faith,\nour money, into a...

630
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,280
更年轻的坏蛋
Well, a younger villain.

631
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,870
可是我...
But I...

632
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,040
就这样吧 再见 Gru
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

633
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,770
我知道现在有些谣言
Now, I know there have been\nsome rumors going around

634
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,150
说银行已经撤资了
that the bank\nis no longer funding us.

635
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,820
我觉得需要出来说明一下
Well, I am here\nto put those rumors to rest.

636
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,900
谣言是真的
They are true.

637
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,030
关于投资
In terms of money,

638
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,370
我们没钱了
we have no money.

639
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,030
那还怎么登月呢?
So how will we get to the moon?

640
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,040
答案很明显
The answer is clear.

641
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,710
我们去不成了
We won't.

642
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,050
我们完了
We are doomed.

643
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:44,170
也许你们可以现在可以考虑另谋高就了
Now would probably be a good time\nto look for other employment options.

644
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,920
不过我知道
I know.

645
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,720
我把自己的履历烧掉了
I have fired up my resume

646
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,300
我同样建议你们也这样做
as I suggest\nthat all of you do, as well.

647
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,810
你们在这干吗?
What is it?

648
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,040
没看见我正在鼓舞士气吗?
Can't you see that I am\nin the middle of a pep talk?

649
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,070
对啊!
Yes!

650
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,070
没错 我们自己造火箭
Yes, we will build our own rocket

651
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,240
竭尽所能 我们可以的!
using this and whatever else\nwe can find!

652
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,320
什么都行! 刨垃圾堆! 把车拆了!
Grab everything! Hit the junkyards!\nTake apart the cars!

653
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,700
谁他妈需要什么银行?
Who needs the bank?

654
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,540
开始行动 动起来!
Let's go. Let's go!

655
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,460
临界危险

656
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,510
已安全

657
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,800
妈! 你怎么来了?
Mom! What are you doing here?

658
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,720

And here he is in the bathtub.

看他的小屁屁
Look at his little buns.

660
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,930
妈
Mom.

661
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,390
一点都不好玩
Not cool.

662
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,940
这张 他当时要去做礼拜
And here, he's all dressed up\nin his Sunday best.

663
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,820
真像个女孩!
He looks like a girl!

664
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,070
没错 不过丑了点!
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

665
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,470
你太好玩了!
You're funny!

666
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:29,050

嗨 老爹
Hey, Dad.

你找我?
You wanted to see me?

672
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:12,690
- 是的 Victor\n- 我现在不叫Victor了
- Yes, I did, Victor.\n- I am not Victor any more.

673
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,240
Victor是上学时叫的 现在叫Vector!
Victor was my nerd name.\nNow I am Vector!

674
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,660
坐好!
Sit down!

675
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,680
你知道缩小射线在哪儿吗?
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

676
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,070
当然! 在我那呢
Duh! Back at my place.

677
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,030
你确定? 在你那儿? 那太好了
Oh, is that right?\nBack at your place? That's cool.

678
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:31,370
那Gru这个估计是仿制的吧!
I guess Gru must just have one\nthat looks exactly like it!

679
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,210
什么? 是那些卖我饼干的小女孩!
What the...\nThose girls sold me cookies!

680
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:41,260
你知道这次盗月计划可能有多赚钱吗?
Do you have any idea\nhow lucrative this moon heist could be?

681
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,140
我把这难得的大好良机给了你
I give you the opportunity\nof a lifetime,

682
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,050
你却让它打了水漂!
and you just blow it!

683
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,230
- 不 我没有\n- 是吗?
- No, I didn't.\n- Oh, really?

684
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,520
让Gru等着吧 看我的最新武器
You just wait\nuntil Gru sees my latest weapon.

685
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,610
乌贼喷枪! 宝贝 来吧!
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

686
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,740
有只乌贼掉我头上了!
There's a squid on my face!

687
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,570
别着急
Don't worry.

688
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,910
月亮逃不出我们的手掌心
The moon is as good as ours.

689
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,250
过来 睡觉了
Come on now, it's bedtime.

690
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,500
你刷牙了吗? 我来闻闻
Did you brush your teeth?\nLet me smell. Let me smell.

691
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,500
你没刷!
You did not!

692
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,670
把睡衣穿上 不要乱动\n好了 说真的 别闹了
Put on your PGs. Hold still.\nOkay, seriously! Seriously!

693
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,260
该说晚安了 不是开玩笑 真的!
This is beddie-bye time, right now.\nI'm not kidding around. I mean it!

694
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,090
- 我们一点都不累!\n- 我累了
- But we're not tired!\n- Well, I am tired.

695
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,390
睡觉前能给我们讲个故事吗?
Will you read us a bedtime story?

696
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,640
不能
No.

697
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,980
求求你了!
Pretty please!

698
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,900
再怎么求也不行
The physical appearance of the "please"\nmakes no difference.

699
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,070
不行 赶快睡觉
It is still no, so go to sleep.

700
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,280
睡不着 我们好兴奋!
But we can't. We're all hyper!

701
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,930
如果不念 我们就一直闹啊闹地吵你
And without a bedtime story,\nwe'll just keep getting up\nand bugging you.

702
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,040
整个晚上哦
All night long.

703
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,460
你们赢了
Fine.

704
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,500
好吧 好吧 小猫困了
All right, all right.\nSleepy Kittens.

705
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,300
小猫困了?
Sleepy Kittens?

706
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,130
- 这是什么?\n- 手指玩偶
- What are these?\n- Puppets.

707
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,890
讲故事时要用到的
You use them when you tell the story.

708
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,510
好的 那就开始吧
Okay, let's get this over with.

709
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:19,270
"3只小猫爱玩耍 太阳下玩了一整天
"Three little kittens loved to play,\nthey had fun in the sun all day.

710
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,770
"妈妈过来说 宝贝们该睡觉"'
Then their mother came out and said,\n'Time for kittens to go to bed.'"

711
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,720
哇哦! 什么鬼东西 你们真的喜欢这个?
Wow! This is garbage.\nYou actually like this?

712
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,280
继续念!
Keep reading!

713
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,450
- 快点!\n- 好吧 那继续
- Come on!\n- All right, all right, all right.

714
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,110
"3只小猫大声吵
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

715
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,540
"妈咪 不累咋睡觉"
'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'

716
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,170
"妈咪笑了 喵喵说"
Their mother smiled\nand said with a purr,

717
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,920
"好吧 至少把毛刷刷好"
'Fine, but at least\nyou should brush your fur.'"

718
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,170
快刷毛毛
Now you brush the fur.

719
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,640
这也能出版?
This is literature?

720
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,970
2岁小孩都会写了 好吧
A 2-year-old could have written this.\nAll right.

721
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,520
"3只小猫 毛都刷刷好"
"Three little kittens\nwith fur all brushed

722
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,020
"大叫说 睡不着 好兴奋! '
said, 'We can't sleep,\nwe feel too rushed!'

723
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,190
"妈咪笑了 用缎子般的声音说"
Their mother replied,\nwith a voice like silk,

724
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,200
"好吧 至少把牛奶都喝掉"'
'Fine, but at least\nyou should drink your milk.'"

725
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,620
喂它们牛奶
Now make them drink the milk.

726
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,820
这本书不好 真是没完没了
I don't like this book.\nThis is going on forever.

727
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:23,320
"小猫们喝完牛奶 揉眼睛开始打哈欠"
"Three little kittens,\nwith milk all gone,\nrubbed their eyes\nand started to yawn.

728
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,740
"睡不着 一点都不困"
'We can't sleep,\nwe can't even try.'

729
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,500
接着猫妈妈唱起了摇篮曲
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

730
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:41,280
"'宝贝们晚安 闭上眼睡觉觉\n一觉睡到大天亮"
'Good night kittens, close your eyes.\nSleep in peace until you rise.

731
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,070
"虽然我们分开睡"
Though while you sleep,\nwe are apart,

732
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,910
"但妈咪永远爱你们哦"
your mommy loves you\nwith all her heart.'"

733
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,250
完了 好了 都晚安吧
The end. Okay, good night.

734
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,510
- 等下!\n- 又怎么了?
- Wait!\n- What?

735
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,460
睡觉前能亲下我们吗?
What about good night kisses?

736
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,170
不行 亲亲抱抱都不行
No, no. There will be no kissing\nor hugging or kissing.

737
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,670
他不会跟吻我们道晚安的 Agnes
He is not gonna kiss us\ngood night, Agnes.

738
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,350
我喜欢他 他真好
I like him. He's nice.

739
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,770
有点吓人
But scary.

740
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,300
像圣诞老人!
Like Santa!

741
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:42,050
还有48小时就起飞了 一切正常
Only 48 hours till the launch,\nand all systems are go.

742
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,970
这个啊
About that,

743
