1
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,915
冲啊，嫱嬉
Onward, Ohauncey!

2
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,649
向高塔顶端的房间冲啊
To the highest room of the tallest tower...

3
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:05,888
那儿我的公主正等待着 她英俊的查明王子来救她
...where my princess awaits rescue from her handsome Prince Oharming!

4
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,007
这比《情书》还难看 我讨厌晚餐剧场
This is worse than "Love Letters". I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,908
我也是
Me, too.

6
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:26,239
就这里，嫱嬉
Whoa there, Ohauncey!

7
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:31,109
听！勇敢的查明王子来了
Hark! The brave Prince Oharming approacheth.

8
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:35,624
不要怕，美女 我会杀死那个怪物
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,695
然后正当的坐上王位
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,421
她说什么？
What did she say?

11
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,600
是史莱克！
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,531
史莱克，耶！
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,867
受死吧，恶心的怪物
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,673
送你去一个你从没感受过的痛苦世界
...to enter into a world of pain with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:59,374
祝你生日快乐 祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to thee Happy birthday to thee

16
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:00,779
你介意吗？
Do you mind?

17
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,281
你介意吗？无聊！
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,125
受死吧，恶心的怪物
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,833
总有一天你会后悔的
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:25,134
我们已经后悔了！
We already are!

21
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,564
妈咪
Mommy...

22
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:58,998
你是对的，我不能让这发生
You're right. I can't let this happen.

23
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,175
绝不
I can't!

24
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:06,112
我才是遥远国正当的国王
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,343
我向你保证，母亲…
And I promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,416
我会恢复我王座的尊严
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,118
这一次
And this time,

28
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:21,425
没人能够阻止我
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,043
早上好
Good morning.

30
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,712
早上好
Good morning.

31
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:45,412
早晨的呼吸
Morning breath.

32
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:48,719
我知道，多美妙啊
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,224
早上好，早上好
Good morning, good morning

34
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:54,296
太阳照屁屁啦
The sun is shining through

35
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,626
早上好，你也早上好
Good morning, good morning To you

36
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,894
还有你！ 你！
And you! And you!

37
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,501
他们长得真快啊
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,735
还不够快
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,508
你们将即位国王和王后
You'll be filling in for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,846
有几个场合需要你出席，殿下
Several functions require your attendance, sir.

41
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,284
太好了！我们开始吧
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,255
拜托，懒骨头 该行动了！
Oome on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,356
你真的需要一套睡衣裤
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,228
片名：《怪物史莱克3》

45
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:35,013
I got some sleep and I needed it

46
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,882
Not a lot, just a little bit

47
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:41,116
Someone's always trying to keep me from it

48
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,091
It's a crying shame

49
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:47,128
It's a royal pain in the neck

50
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,945
我封你为爵士
I knight thee.

51
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,936
如果你想继任国王 你就该表现的像个国王
If you're filling in for a king, you should look like one.

52
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:17,138
谁能进来帮史莱克弄一下造型？
Oan somebody come in and work on Shrek?

53
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:20,473
我看看我能怎么做
I will see what I can do.

54
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,333
耶，哇
Yeah, wow.

55
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,665
这真的有必要吗？
Is this really necessary?

56
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,105
当然有必要，菲奥娜
Quite necessary, Fiona.

57
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:52,044
- 我是史莱克，你个笨蛋 - 管他呢
- I'm Shrek, you twit. - Whatever.

58
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:55,879
好，这不是排练 我们来看看下面的骚动吧
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples. Let's see some hustle!

59
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,954
微笑，各位！微笑！
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

60
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,546
我不知道我还能忍多久
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

61
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,627
对不起，但你能不能只是露齿一笑 再忍耐一下呢？
I'm sorry, but can you just try to grin and bear it?

62
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,787
等到爸爸好转就没事了
It's just until Dad gets better.

63
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,197
史莱克？
Shrek?

64
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:13,127
你看上去很英俊
You look handsome.

65
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,204
过来，你
Oome here, you.

66
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:34,217
我屁股痒的要命 穿了这猴子装我够不到
My butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

67
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,994
嘿，你！过来，你叫什么名字？
Hey, you! Oome here. What's your name?

68
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,494
费斗斯沃斯，殿下
Fiddlesworth, sir.

69
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:41,723
好极了
Perfect.

70
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,767
女士们先生们…
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:50,067
有请菲奥娜公主和史莱克殿下
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

72
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,174
啊！就是那里
Ahh! You've got it.

73
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:57,837
再左边一点
A little to the left.

74
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,278
就是那里，很好
That's it! That's good.

75
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:04,512
哦，耶，挠，就是那个
Oh, yeah! Scratch that thing! You're on it.

76
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,088
史莱克！
Shrek!

77
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,120
我的眼睛！
My eye!

78
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:13,422
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

79
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:20,992
菲奥娜！
Fiona!

80
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:27,339
- 你还好吗？ - 嗯，我很好
- Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine.

81
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,280
哦，虾，我的最爱
Shrimp! My favorite!

82
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,490
- 我受够了，我们走！ - 冷静
- That's it! We're leaving! - Oalm down.

83
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,567
冷静？你认为我们是在跟谁开玩笑？ 我是个怪物
Oalm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre.

84
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:55,297
我不适合做这个，菲奥娜 永远都不适合
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona, and I never will be.

85
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,741
我认为会好的
I think that went well.

86
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,106
驴子！
Donkey!

87
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,975
别这样，史莱克！
Oome on, Shrek!

88
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,712
有些人就是不识相
Some people just don't understand boundaries.

89
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:21,590
想想，再过几天我们就能回家去了
Just think. A couple more days and we'll be back home...

90
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:25,031
回到我们那点缀着菌菇 充满着虫子的小木屋了
...in our vermin-filled shack strewn with fungus...

91
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,070
充满着泥土的气息和懒散
...and filled with the stench of mud and neglect.

92
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,833
你让我好像回到了那里
You had me at "vermin-filled".

93
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:36,510
也许地上还有一串小脚印
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter of little feet on the floor.

94
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,710
对，沼泽里的老鼠开始产卵
That's right, the swamp rats will be spawning.

95
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,215
不
Uh, no.

96
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:45,048
我想到的是比沼泽鼠更大一点的
What I'm thinking of is a little bigger than a swamp rat.

97
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,213
驴子？
Donkey?

98
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:50,019
不，史莱克，假设，理论上的…
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

99
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:53,422
是小怪物的小脚印？
...they were little ogre feet?

100
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,237
亲爱的，我们要理智对待这个事情
Honey, let's be rational about this.

101
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:05,739
你最近看到过婴儿吗？
Have you seen a baby lately?

102
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:09,073
他们只会吃然后拉，还有哭
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

103
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,580
当他们拉的时候哭 哭的时候拉
...then they cry when they poop and poop when they cry.

104
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:15,514
现在，想像一下怪物婴儿
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

105
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:19,452
他们哭的更厉害，拉的也更厉害
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

106
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,185
史莱克，你从没想过拥有一个家庭吗？
Shrek, don't you ever think about having a family?

107
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:26,888
现在，你就是我的家庭
Right now, you're my family.

108
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,062
那么急干吗，有人要死了吗
Somebody better be dying.

109
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,235
我快要死了
I'm dying.

110
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,736
哈罗德？
Harold?

111
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:46,007
不要忘了付钱给园丁，莉莉安
Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian.

112
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,083
当然，亲爱的
Of course, darling.

113
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,878
菲奥娜
Fiona.

114
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,545
在，爸爸？
Yes, Daddy?

115
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,419
我知道我过去错怪了你很多
I know I made many mistakes with you.

116
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:57,893
没事的
It's okay.

117
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,155
但你对史莱克的爱…
But your love for Shrek has...

118
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,497
教会了我很多
...taught me much.

119
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:06,626
我亲爱的孩子…
My dear boy...

120
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,035
我很自豪称你为我的儿子
...I am proud to call you my son.

121
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:13,301
我也很自豪称你为我的青蛙…
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

122
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:15,877
…国王岳父
...King dad-in-law.

123
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:21,610
现在有件事要处理
Now there is a matter of business to attend to.

124
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,954
青蛙国王…死了
The Frog King... is dead.

125
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,108
戴好你的帽子，傻瓜
Put your hat back on, fool.

126
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:46,834
史莱克…
Shrek...

127
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,638
请来这边
...please come hither.

128
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,847
是的，爸爸？
Yeah, Dad?

129
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:57,147
王国需要一位新的国王
This kingdom needs a new king.

130
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:03,152
你和菲奥娜将即位王座
You and Fiona are next in line for the throne.

131
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:09,026
即位？你看，爸爸 这就是为什么人民爱戴你的原因
Next in line. You see, Dad, that's why people love you.

132
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,499
即使临终之时，你还在开玩笑
Even on your deathbed, you're still making jokes.

133
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:19,870
得了吧，爸爸，怪物做国王？
Oome on, Dad. An ogre as king?

134
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,535
这不是个好主意
That's not such a good idea.

135
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,978
必须有另外的人来继任，任何人！
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

136
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:31,315
除了你，只有一个继承人
Aside from you, there is only one remaining heir.

137
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,652
真的？是谁？爸爸
Really? Who is he, Dad?

138
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,850
他叫…
His name is...

139
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,286
叫…
...is...

140
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,056
他叫什么？
What's his name?

141
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,790
叫…
...is...

142
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:45,793
爸爸！
Daddy!

143
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:05,021
他叫亚瑟
His name is Arthur.

144
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,554
亚瑟？
Arthur?

145
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:16,893
我知道你会…处理好这件事的
I know you'll do...

146
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,873
...what's right.

147
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,267
哈罗德？
Harold?

148
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,963
爸爸？爸爸！
Dad? Dad!

149
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,636
爸爸？
Dad?

150
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:27,835
脱帽，朋友
Do your thing, man.

151
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:01,622
When you were young and your heart

152
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,919
Was an open book

153
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,059
You used to say live and let live

154
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,533
You know you did, you know you did You know you did

155
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:19,400
But if this ever changing world In which we live in

156
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:24,441
Makes you give in and cry

157
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,111
Say live and let die

158
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:34,217
Live and let die

159
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:14,493
Hey, lady You, lady

160
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,660
Cursing at your life

161
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,997
You're a discontented mother

162
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:25,334
And a regimented wife

163
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:54,217
王子想在这儿喝酒该怎么做呢？
What does a prince have to do to get a drink here?

164
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,254
啊，梅波
Ah, Mabel!

165
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,797
为什么他们叫你丑陋的继姐 我一直不明白
Why they call you an ugly stepsister, I'll never know.

166
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:05,993
多丽丝呢？今晚休息？
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

167
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:09,902
这里不欢迎她，你也一样
She's not welcome here, and neither are you.

168
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,600
你想要干吗，查明？
What do you want, Oharming?

169
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:17,804
没什么，想找个机会赎罪
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

170
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,883
一杯鸡尾酒
And a Fuzzy Navel.

171
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:24,077
给在场所有我的朋友们一杯鸡尾酒
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

172
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,152
我们不是你的朋友
We're not your friends.

173
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,489
你不属于这里
You don't belong here.

174
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:38,795
你说得对，但我意思是 有谁属于这里呢？
You're absolutely right, but, I mean, do any of us?

175
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,562
在他脸上做个记号
Do a number on his face.

176
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:45,300
等等，等等 我们其实都一样
Wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think.

177
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:49,344
丑巫婆！七个小矮人救了白雪公主 然后发生了什么？
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs saved Snow White, and what happened?

178
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,571
这和你有什么关系？
Oh, what's it to you?

179
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,978
他们给了你最不公平的待遇
They left you the unfairest of them all.

180
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:57,644
现在你在这里 靠台球来换取你的下一顿饭
Now here you are, hustling pool to get your next meal.

181
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,618
那感觉怎样？
How does that feel?

182
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,687
很不公平
Pretty unfair.

183
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,229
还有你！
And you!

184
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:12,995
你的明星木偶放弃了表演 去寻找他的父亲
Your star puppet abandons the show to go and find his father.

185
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,597
我讨厌那个小木头玩偶
I hate that little wooden puppet.

186
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,708
还有你铁钩
And Hook.

187
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,434
还需要我说吗？
Need I say more?

188
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,911
- 你，弗朗皮克斯金 - 是兰佩尔斯汀斯金
- And you, Frumpypigskin! - Rumpelstiltskin.

189
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,678
他们保证你的长子又在哪里呢？
Where's that firstborn you were promised?

190
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,990
梅波，记住你是怎么不能把你的肥脚丫…
Mabel. Remember how you couldn't get your little fat foot...

191
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,026
穿进那个小的水晶鞋的吗？
...into that tiny glass slipper?

192
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:44,224
灰姑娘此刻正在遥远国…
Oinderella is in Far Far Away right now...

193
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:52,007
正吃着糖果 和那些和你作对的人快乐着呢
...eating bonbons, cavorting with every last fairy tale creature...

194
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,987
...that has ever done you wrong!

195
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:57,079
从前，一些人把我们称为失败者
Once upon a time, someone decided that we were the losers.

196
00:16:57,213 --> 00:17:00,080
但每个故事都有两面
But there are two sides to every story...

197
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,775
我们的那一面还没有讲给人听
...and our side has not been told!

198
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,788
所以谁要加入我？谁想要翻身一次？
So who will join me? Who wants to come out on top for once?

199
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:09,585
谁想要…
Who wants their...

200
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,889
从此以后一直幸福？
..."happily ever after"?

201
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,741
这边，绅士们
This way, gents.

202
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:48,121
人在江湖，身不由己啊
It's out of my hands, senorita. The winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

203
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:52,064
但我永远不会忘记你 你是我一生的爱
But I will never forget you. You are the love of my life.

204
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,636
你也是
As are you.

205
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:57,137
还有你
And, uh, you.

206
00:17:57,273 --> 00:18:00,436
我不认识你，但我也愿意
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

207
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,942
我要走了
I got to go!

208
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:06,042
我也不想离开你们
I don't wanna leave you either.

209
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:09,015
但你知道史莱克是怎样的 这兄弟没有我就不行
But you know how Shrek is. The dude's lost without me.

210
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:13,286
不要担心，我会每天给你快递香吻的
But don't worry. I'll send you airmail kisses every day!

211
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:15,989
要坚强，孩子们
Be strong, babies.

212
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,560
椰子，花生，听妈妈的话
Ooco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

213
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:22,688
香蕉，不要再在你妹妹头上烤蜜饯了哦
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows on your sister's head.

214
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,328
那才是我的乖孩子
That's my special boy!

215
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:29,563
都过来，给你们老爸一个大大的拥抱
Oome here, all of you! Give your daddy a big hug!

216
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,477
史莱克？
Shrek?

217
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:42,781
也许你该留下继任国王
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

218
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,446
得了吧，我怎么可能来管理国家
Oome on. There's no way I could run a kingdom.

219
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:49,581
你的堂弟亚瑟才是个完美的选择
That's why your cousin Arthur is a perfect choice.

220
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,251
不是的，你知道…
It's not that. You see...

221
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:56,855
如果他给我麻烦 我可以说服他给他讲道理
And if he gives me trouble, I always have persuasion and reason.

222
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,333
这法宝是说服力，这法宝是讲道理
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

223
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,138
菲奥娜…
Fiona...

224
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,539
很快就只有你和我…
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

225
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:09,338
还有我们的沼泽
...and our swamp.

226
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,672
不只是你和我
It's not going to be just you and me.

227
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,851
上船啦！
All aboard!

228
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,854
会的，我保证
It will be. I promise.

229
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,515
我爱你
I love you.

230
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,680
[我们爱你，爸爸]

231
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:31,794
太美了
That's lovely.

232
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:33,527
再见，孩子们！
Bye-bye, babies!

233
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,304
史莱克！
Shrek!

234
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,741
- 等等 - 什么？
- Wait! - What is it?

235
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,372
我…
I'm... I'm...

236
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,252
我也爱你，亲爱的！
I love you, too, honey!

237
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:56,222
不！我说，我…
No! I said I'm...

238
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,662
你什么？
You're what?

239
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,231
我说我怀孕了！
I said I'm pregnant!

240
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:08,870
那是什么？
What was that?

241
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,065
你要做父亲了！
You're going to be a father!

242
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,707
太好了！
That's great!

243
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,110
真的？我很高兴你这么想
Really? I'm glad you think so!

244
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:20,648
我爱你！
I love you!

245
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,754
Yeah!

246
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,251
我也爱你！
Me, too! You!

247
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,617
我要做叔叔了！ 我要做叔叔了！
I'm going to be an uncle! I'm going to be an uncle!

248
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:35,822
你，我的朋友，将成为皇室…
And you, my friend, are royally...

249
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:15,526
家
Home.

250
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,148
史莱克！
Shrek!

251
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:32,818
菲奥娜！
Fiona!

252
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,157
菲奥娜？
Fiona?

253
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,779
哦，不
Oh, no.

254
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,852
我一直说，能吃下去就别吐出来
Better out than in, I always say.

255
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,861
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

256
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,594
没事的，会没事的
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

257
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,036
住手，嘿，等等！
Stop! Hey, wait!

258
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:18,951
驴子！驴子！
Donkey. Donkey!

259
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,323
醒醒！
Wake up!

260
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,096
爸爸！
Dada!

261
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:28,527
史莱克？你好吧？
Shrek! Are you okay?

262
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:35,802
我不敢相信我要做父亲了 这怎么发生的？
I can't believe I'm going to be a father. How did this happen?

263
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:40,143
请允许我解释，当一个男人 对一个女人有感觉时…
Allow me to explain. When a man has feelings for a woman...

264
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,808
一股强大的冲动占据着他
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

265
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,443
我知道这是怎么发生的
I know how it happened.

266
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:48,348
我只是不敢相信
I just can't believe it.

267
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,958
这是怎么发生的？
How does it happen?

268
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:05,216
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

269
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:07,982
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon

270
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:10,718
When you coming home, son? I don't know when

271
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,158
But we'll get together then, Dad.

272
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,307
驴子！你能不能只唱…
Donkey! Oan you just cut to the part

273
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,976
让我感觉舒服的部分？
where you're supposed to make me feel better?

274
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:21,246
你知道我很爱菲奥娜，对吧，老大？
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

275
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,451
我要说的是你，我还有我堂弟的船…
What I am talking about is you, me, my cousin's boat...

276
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:31,192
再来一壶冰酒，加上两个礼拜的钓鱼
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

277
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,199
不要听他的！
Don't listen to him!

278
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:36,032
有孩子不会毁掉你的生活
Having a baby isn't going to ruin your life.

279
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:40,700
我担心的不是毁掉我的生活 而是孩子的生活
It's not my life I'm worried about ruining, it's the kid's.

280
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:45,143
你听到过别人说“像怪物一样美”…
When have you ever heard the phrase "as sweet as an ogre"...

281
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:47,715
或是”像怪物一样有教养“
...or "as nurturing as an ogre"...

282
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,219
或是”你会喜欢我爸爸的 他是个真正的怪物“这样的话吗？
...or "You'll love my dad. He's a real ogre."

283
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,118
好，我懂了
Okay. I get it.

284
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:57,715
虽然这不会那么容易 但你有我们的帮助
It's not going to be easy. But you got us to help you.

285
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,555
那倒是
That's true.

286
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:01,162
命中注定的
I'm doomed.

287
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:02,958
你会好的
You'll be fine.

288
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,766
你完了
You're finished.

289
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,699
哦，完…成了你的旅程
Uh, with yourjourney.

290
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:23,318
”沃…册特…斯里？“ 听上去很新奇！
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"? Now that sounds fancy!

291
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:24,783
是沃塞斯特雷
It's Worcestershire.

292
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,752
和那个沙司牌子一样？
Like the sauce?

293
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,220
好香！
It's spicy!

294
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,892
他们肯定在期待我们
They must be expecting us.

295
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,600
这个沃什么的到底是个什么地方？
What in the shista-shire kind of place is this?

296
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:47,937
我的胃好疼还有我的手掌在出汗 一定是个中学
Well, my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

297
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,237
中学？
High school?

298
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,936
好了吗？开始
Ready? Okay!

299
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,514
“你想到达艺术的顶端吗?”
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

300
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:57,608
“是啊，我们能，我们能！ 有什么能阻止你呢？”
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

301
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:00,221
“不，没有，没有”
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

302
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:09,487
好，佩西，脱缰一样冲吧
All right, Mr. Percival, ease up on the reins.

303
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:16,532
伙计，别烧了我的乳香和没药
For lo, bro, don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh.

304
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:20,164
那平底鞋和混乱场面让我感到恶心
I'm feeling nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!

305
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,973
你不穿内裤哪来的平底鞋呢？
How did you receive wedgies when you are clearly not the wearer of underpants?

306
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:28,015
有些事是不言而喻的
Let's just say some things are better left unsaid.

307
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,211
所以我要说“我宁愿得黑死病 也不愿和你出去约会”
So I was all like, "I'd rather get the black plague than go out with you."

308
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,687
- 哦，绝对的 - 你说什么
- Oh, totally. - Pardon me.

309
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:37,622
- 绝对恶心 - 是啊
- Totally ew-eth. - Yeah, totally.

310
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,822
我刚把我的角色等级升到了+3超能力
I just altered my character level to +3 superb-ability.

311
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,524
嗨，我们在找一个叫…
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

312
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:49,195
谁弄了+9的傀儡符咒 又召唤了怪物和四足怪？
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and summoned the beast and his quadruped?

313
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,534
我知道你们很忙没时间 但你们能告诉我哪里能找到亚瑟吗？
I know you're busy not fitting in, but can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

314
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,975
他在那里
He's over there.

315
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:21,569
没有比胜利更美味的了
There is no sweeter taste on thy tongue than victory!

316
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,873
强壮，英俊，长着一张领导者的脸
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

317
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:30,342
亚瑟长得不就像一位国王吗？
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

318
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,845
不好意思
Sorry.

319
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:36,210
你刚才说你在找亚瑟？
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

320
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,786
显而易见的
That information is on a need-to-know basis.

321
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:40,616
这是顶级机密！
It's top secret!

322
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:44,351
先生们，我们走 去洗澡！
Now, gentlemen, let's away. To the showers!

323
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:48,489
你好，陛下
Greetings, Your Majesty.

324
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:50,189
今天是你的幸运日
This is your lucky day.

325
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,126
你是什么东西？
What are you supposed to be?

326
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,534
某种变异的巨大妖精还是什么？
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun or something?

327
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,032
变异？你真搞笑
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

328
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:03,478
放我下来，怪物！
Unhand me, monster!

329
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,580
不要动，亚瑟
Stop squirming, Arthur.

330
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:08,047
我不是亚瑟
I'm not Arthur.

331
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:12,577
我是兰斯洛特
I am Lancelot.

332
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:15,384
那边的那个傻瓜才是亚瑟
That dork over there is Arthur.

333
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,659
这…真的是…很尴尬
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

334
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,393
但蒂凡尼对你很有兴趣
...but Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly.

335
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:29,936
她想你会不会愿意邀请她去“回归舞会”
She thought perchance thou would ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

336
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,164
什么？
Excuse me?

337
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:35,243
这样的，她对大学男生 还有神话怪物很感兴趣
Like, whatever. She's into college guys and mythical creatures.

338
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:40,774
哦，亚瑟…
Oh, Arthur...

339
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:44,613
出来，出来，不管你在哪里
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

340
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,283
你们最好走远点，混蛋！
You better run, you little punk no-goodniks!

341
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:52,826
贫嘴驴短内裤的日子结束了
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers are over!

342
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,265
等等
Hold it.

343
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,995
我们是来参加吉祥物比赛的
We're here for the mascot contest.

344
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:10,873
我们也是来参加吉祥物比赛的
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

345
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,538
这是服装吗？
This is a costume?

346
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:15,673
我弄了整整一晚上呢
Worked on it all night long.

347
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,816
看上去象真的一样
Looks pretty real to me.

348
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:21,354
如果他是真的，我能这样做吗？
If he were real, could I do this?

349
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,686
或是这样？
Or this?

350
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:30,830
如果是真的，早就疼得要命了
If it were real, that would have been agonizingly painful.

351
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:34,163
- 看好这个！ - 够了，孩子们
- Now watch this! - That's quite enough, boys.

352
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:39,639
谢谢普林波顿教授和他的“只要说不”演讲
Thank you to Professor Primbottom and his lecture...

353
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,619
...on "just say nay".

354
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:44,842
现在不再唆，让我们热烈…
And now, without further ado, let's give a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

355
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,472
欢迎吉祥物大赛的冠军…
...to the winner of our mascot contest, the...

356
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:50,641
怪物？
...ogre?

357
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,019
对，我是新的吉祥物
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

358
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:58,786
我们还是热烈的为那些…
So let's really try and beat the other guys at...

359
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:02,056
不知道在干吗的人鼓掌吧！
...whatever it is they're doing!

360
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,593
这太不正统了
This is all a bit unorthodox...

361
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:12,400
哪里我能找到亚瑟・潘德拉根？
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

362
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,167
嘿，等等…
Hey, wait...

363
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:21,909
经典
Olassic.

364
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:23,746
你该为自己感到羞愧！
You should be ashamed of yourself!

365
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:26,286
不是我干的，是他们干的
I didn't do it. They did.

366
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:32,822
请不要吃掉我
Please don't eat me.

367
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,294
吃掉他！吃掉他！吃掉他！
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

368
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:38,960
我不是来吃他的！
I'm not here to eat him!

369
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:43,064
你该打包整理你的行李了
Time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies.

370
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:45,435
你将是遥远国新的国王
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

371
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:47,235
什么？
What?

372
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:52,975
亚蒂王？ 他更像是笨蛋村的村长！
Artie a king? More like the Mayor of Loserville!

373
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,689
Burn.

374
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:03,450
这是真的吗？
Is this for real?

375
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:07,995
当然，清理好你的衣柜，孩子 你的王国等着你管理

376
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,792
等等…我真的是唯一的继承人？
So, wait... l'm really the only heir?

377
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,465
唯一的一个
The one and only.

378
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,464
等我一下
Give me a second.

379
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:20,468
我的人民…
My good people...

380
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,339
这是非常好的一课
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

381
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:27,779
下一次你们准备把一个小孩的头 泡在尿壶里的时候，请停下想想
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

382
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:30,408
“嘿，也许这个家伙也是有感情的”

383

“也许我该放他一马”

“也许因为…也许…”

385
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,856
“这家伙会成为，有可能，成为国王？”
...this guy's gonna turn out to be, I don't know, a king?

386
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:46,024
也许他颁布的第一个皇家法令就是 放逐那些曾经戏弄过他的人
Maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him."

387
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:49,035
我在看着你，骑马队！
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

388
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,568
还有奎因？哦，奎因

好朋友们，我很伤心，但…
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

好了，我们不要搞的太过了

我将建立我的城市，摇滚的人民

00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:30,104
没，一点也没
No. Not at all.

00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:32,675
你们闻到火腿的味道了吗？
Do you smell ham?

401
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:35,943
现在是礼物时间！
It's present time!

402
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,881
菲奥娜，请先打开我的礼物 前面的那个
Fiona, please open mine first. It's the one in front.

403
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:46,654

"Oongratulations on your new mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

404

“希望这对你有用，爱你的，灰姑娘”
"Hopefully this helps. Love, Oinderella."

405
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,794
- 看看那个！ - 那是什么？

406
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,838
用来打扫大便的
It's for the poopies.

407
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:58,530

Wait... babies poop?

每个人都大便的，睡美人

00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:01,609
菲奥娜！
Fiona!

你知道孩子会喜欢的 因为我也喜欢！

伙计们，你们真是太好了，谢谢

我给你最大的礼物 因为爱你也最深

433
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:07,833
她说的对

孩子只会加深史莱克和菲奥娜之间的爱

当他第一次知道时，他说…

好，好，好，如果这不是皮特・潘

掠夺够了！向城堡冲啊！

我们尽量拖延住他们！

449
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:29,582
史莱克和菲奥娜在哪里？
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

450
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:31,879
从没听说过这名字
The name doesn't ring a bell.

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,715
没听过
No bell.

452
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:37,223
我建议你们这群蠢蛋…
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

453
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,953
好好的跟遥远国的新国王合作！
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

454
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:43,792
你唯一可以成为的是傻瓜国的国王！
The only thing you're ever gonna be king of is King of the Stupids!

455
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:46,230
- 铁钩！ - 在！
- Hook! - Right!

456
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,598
来吧，你这小饼干
Avast, ye cookie.

457
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:52,867
说话呀
Start talking.

458
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:58,736
- 金吉！ - 爸爸！
- Gingy! - Papa!

459
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,246
大家坐下！
Settle down now.

460
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:17,528
坐上漂亮船去买棒棒糖
On the good ship Lollipop

461
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:21,102
去糖果店的旅程真是太美好了
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

462
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:22,225
你！
You!

463
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:25,266
你不会说谎的
You can't lie.

464
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:29,070
告诉我，木偶…史莱克在哪里？
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

465
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,311
那…我不知道他不在哪里
Well... I don't know where he's not.

466
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,645
你不知道史莱克在哪里？
You don't know where Shrek is?

467
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:40,380
不能不正确的假定…
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

468
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:44,788
我不能确切的不说出 或部分不几乎是不正确
...that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

469
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,292
那你肯定是知道他在哪里！
So you do know where he is!

470
00:37:46,428 --> 00:37:48,953
恰恰相反，我可能或多或少
On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less

471
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:55,129
不确定的不完全否定这个意思
not definitely rejecting the idea

472
00:37:51,446 --> 00:37:55,109
that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty...

473
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,259
住嘴！
Stop it!

474
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:58,532
我不知道他不应该在哪里
...I do not know where he shouldn't be.

475
00:37:58,674 --> 00:38:01,142
如果确实那不是他不在的地方
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

476
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:04,871
即使他不是不在我所知道的他在的地方 这意味着……
Even if he wasn't not where I knew he was, it could mean...

477
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:07,243
坐上漂亮的船去买棒棒糖
On the good ship Lollipop

478
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:11,785
够了！史莱克出去要把下一任的国王带回来
Enough! Shrek went off to bring back the next heir!

479
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,587
他要带回下一任的国王？
He's bringing back the next heir?

480
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,215
不！
No!

481
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:22,658
铁钩！去除掉这个新“国王”
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

482
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:24,663
但把史莱克带来给我
But bring Shrek to me.

483
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,997
我给他准备了特别的主意
I have something special in mind for him.

484
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:30,297
他绝不会被你的诡计陷害的
He'll never fall for your tricks!

485
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,635
哦，孩子
Oh, boy.

486
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:46,511
我真不敢相信，我，一个国王？
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

487
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:49,681
我知道我出身皇室，但…
I knew I came from royalty, but...

488
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,918
我原以为大家都忘记了我
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

489
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,791
哦，不，实际上是国王亲自点名要你继任的
Oh, no. In fact the King asked for you personally.

490
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,491
真的？哇
Really? Wow.

491
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:02,065
但我知道这不是玩游戏
But I know it's not all fun and games.

492
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:05,196
事实上这确实是玩游戏
It really is all fun and games, actually.

493
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,935
当然，你要册封一些新英雄 启航一两艘舰船
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two.

494
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:13,411
顺便说一下，你务必确保 能用瓶子击中轮船
By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle.

495
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:16,346
任何傻瓜都能用一个瓶子击中一艘轮船
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.

496
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:20,120
我听说这其实要比看上去来的困难
Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.

497
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:22,223
这真是太棒了
This is going to be huge.

498
00:39:22,357 --> 00:39:27,226
聚会，公主，城堡，公主
Parties, princesses, castles. Princesses.

499
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:30,229
你会生活的很奢侈
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

500
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:32,833
最好的厨师会等候你的命令
The finest chefs will wait for your order.

501
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,937
幸运的是，你还会有皇家食物品尝师
And fortunately, you'll have the royal food tasters.

502
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:37,766
他们是做什么的？
What do they do?

503
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:42,502
在国王吃东西前先品尝 确保食物没有被放毒
Taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned.

504
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:45,238
- 放毒？ - 或者太咸了
- Poisoned? - Or too salty.

505
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,907
不要担心，你的侍卫会保护你的安全
Don't worry. Your bodyguards will keep you safe.

506
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,315
他们愿意随时随地的牺牲自己…
All of them willing at a moment's notice

507
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,286
为了保护你的生命
to lay down their lives out of devotion to you.

508
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:55,856
真的？
Really?

509
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:59,017
整个国家都指望着你的智慧和指引
The whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance.

510
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,328
确保他们不会死于饥饿
Make sure they don't die of famine!

511
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,192
- 或是瘟疫 - 瘟疫太糟了
- Or plague. - Plague is bad.

512
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:06,232
咳嗽，呻吟，化脓溃疡
The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores.

513
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:12,240
化脓溃疡！ 你真是个有趣的可爱小猫
Festering sores! You are one funny kitty cat.

514
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:14,307
我刚才说什么了？
What did I say?

515
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,809
我们不想让亚蒂有错误的想法
We don't want Artie getting the wrong idea.

516
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,739
亚蒂？
Artie?

517
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:24,781
够郁闷的！
There goes my hip!

518
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,081
亚蒂！你在干吗？
Artie! What are you doing?

519
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:31,151
你看我在干吗？！
What does it look like?!

520
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,297
这真的不是你该做的
This really isn't up to you.

521
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,298
我对于当国王一无所知
I don't know anything about being king!

522
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,368
你会慢慢学会的！
You'll learn on the job!

523
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,796
不好意思，但我准备回去
Sorry, but I'm going back.

524
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:48,375
回去哪里？去当一个失败者？
Back to what? Being a loser?

525
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:53,505
看看你做的好事！
Now look what you did!

526
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:58,116
看看我做的好事？ 是谁在掌舵啊，大幅？
Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel, chief?

527
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,611
史莱克！
Shrek!

528
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:14,959
上岸！
Land ho!

529
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:29,313
真是丢脸
How humiliating.

530
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,253
哦，做得好，殿下
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

531
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:37,085
现在成了“殿下”？ 刚才谁在叫“失败者”？
Now it's "Your Highness"? What happened to "loser"?

532
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:40,126
如果你认为这就能使你离开 那是不可能的
If you think this is getting you out of anything, it isn't.

533
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:44,028
我们无论如何会回到遥远国
We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another...

534
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,600
而你将会成为父亲！
...and you're going to be a father!

535
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,168
什么？
What?

536
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:50,562
你刚才说“父亲”
You just said "father".

537
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:53,435
国王！你将会成为国王！
King! You're going to be king!

538
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:56,567
“你会成为国王”是啊，对的
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

539
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,212
你去哪里？
Where are you going?

540
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:01,815
远远…的离开你
Far Far Away... from you!

541
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,918
回来，年轻人！
Get back here, young man!

542
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:08,378
老大？我认为他不回来了
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

543
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:11,720
也许这是对的 他真的不是当国王的料
Maybe it's for the best. He's not exactly king material.

544
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,091
那你计划什么时候告诉他 你才应该当国王？
When did you plan to tell him you were supposed to be king?

545
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,063
得了，我为什么要那么做？
Oome on. Why would I do that?

546
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,260
而且，他做国王比我强十倍
Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me.

547
00:42:21,403 --> 00:42:25,362
如果你想要他跟你走 你需要改变你的战略
Then change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with him.

548
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,540
你说得对，驴子
You're right, Donkey.

549
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,404
这个怎样？
What about this?

550
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:37,382
- 史莱克！ - 得了，只是个玩笑
- Shrek! - Oome on. It's just a joke.

551
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:40,285
算是吧…
Still...

552
00:42:57,072 --> 00:42:58,733
听着，亚蒂
Listen, Artie.

553
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:04,438
如果你觉得这整件事情很糟糕 我理解你，兄弟
If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

554
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:08,709
我不想难为你，让你心烦意乱
I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof.

555
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,977
但我想要说的是，你…
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

556
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,316
想想这整个事情，孩子！
...check out this kazing thazing, bazaby!

557
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:16,549
如果这不合理，或是我所说的…
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

558
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:19,626
不够真诚，你可以直接说 “哦，不，你别”
ain't straight trippin', say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

559
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,195
“你快让我疯了”
You're getting on my last nerve."

560
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,322
那么我会知道这是… 知道这是不值得的
And then I'll know it's... I'll know it's wack!

561
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:28,129
救命啊！
Help!

562
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,671
我被一个怪物绑架了 他想跟我拉关系
I've been kidnapped by a monster who's trying to relate to me!

563
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:35,435
- 亚蒂，等等 - 快点！救命！有人吗？
- Artie, wait. - Oome on! Help! Hello?

564
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:40,642
大家好，宇宙的孩子们
Greetings, cosmic children of the universe.

565
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:42,716
欢迎来到我的宁静之处
Welcome to my serenity circle.

566
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:46,981
请不要带坏的电颤琴到康复小屋里来
Please leave any bad vibes outside the healing vortex.

567
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:48,953
现在准备好…
Now prepare to...

568
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,462
我就知道我该拿保修单的！
I knew I should have got that warranty!

569
00:44:00,368 --> 00:44:01,835
梅林先生？
Mr. Merlin?

570
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,437
你认识这个人？
You know this guy?

571
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:07,837
是啊，他没神经失常前 是学校里的魔法老师
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher, until he had his nervous breakdown.

572
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:11,343
专业点讲，我只是3等疲劳
Technically, I was merely a victim of a level 3 fatigue.

573
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,572
在我的理疗师
At the request of my therapist,

574
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:17,344
和学校方面要求下 我退休来享受宁静世界
and the school authorities, I retired to the tranquility of nature

575
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:19,646
为了发现我神圣的目标
to discover my divine purpose.

576
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:24,557
谁有兴趣来点小吃或是饮料吗？
Oan I interest anyone in a snack or beverage?

577
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:25,785
哦，不了
Uh, no.

578
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:29,260
你确定不想尝尝我的烤脆皮面包？
Sure you don't want to try my Rock Au Gratin?

579
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,634
是有机的哦
It's organic.

580
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:36,202
谢谢了，我来的途中吃了一大块圆石
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

581
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:39,273
我们需要去遥远国的线路
We need directions to Far Far Away.

582
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:41,932
“我们”？谁说我要和你一起去？
"We"? Who said I was going with you?

583
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:46,446
我说的，人民指望着你 所以不要再躲避了
I did. People are counting on you, so don't try to weasel out of it.

584
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:48,640
如果那份差事真的那么好，你去做好了
If the job's so great, you do it.

585
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:53,450
你要明白，孩子 现在再也没有什么好人了
Understand this, kid. No more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

586
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:55,886
他就是你的所谓好人？
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

587
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:57,958
是的，我会想念他的
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

588
00:44:58,093 --> 00:45:02,496
为什么你不自己去恐吓村庄 别管我！
Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone!

589
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:07,158
那就是怪物的爆发吗？ 在我没发飙前…
Was that a crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away...

590
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:11,329
你最好给我回遥远国去当国王 我该怎么发飙？
...before I kick it there! Now, which way am I kicking?

591
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:13,304
我可以告诉你，但由于你…
I could tell you, but since you're

592
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,966
正处于自我毁灭的怒火漩涡之中
in the midst of a self-destructive rage spiral,

593
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,636
告诉你是不负责任
it would be karmically irresponsible.

594
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,443
自我毁灭？ 你帮不帮我们？
Self-destructive? Are you going to help us or not?

595
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,178
肯定帮，但只有在你…
Most definitely, but only after you

596
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,517
进行了心灵之旅后！
take the journey to your soul!

597
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:30,021
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

598
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:33,992
要么就是这个，要么就进行心理治疗
It's either that or primal scream therapy.

599
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:38,726
好的，心灵之旅
All right. Journey to the soul.

600
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,432
现在，你们所有人…
Now, all of you,

601
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:44,094
都给我注视着这真理之火
look into the Fire of Truth

602
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,231
然后告诉我你们看到了什么
and tell me what you see.

603
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:51,943
哦，手势猜谜游戏！
Ooh, charades!

604
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,847
好，我看到了一个有肉桂卷的荷兰软糖馅饼
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls!

605
00:45:56,985 --> 00:45:59,579
好，怪物，该你了
Okay, monster... go for it.

606
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,958
我看到了一匹彩虹小马
I see a rainbow pony.

607
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,032
做得好！该你了，孩子
Excellent work! Now the boy.

608
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,634
这太废了
This is lame.

609
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:16,032
你才废！快试一下
You're lame! Now just go for it.

610
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:18,936
好的
Okay.

611
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:24,211
有一个小鸟还有个鸟爸爸，坐在鸟巢里
There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest.

612
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:26,336
好！继续！
Yes! Stay with it!

613
00:46:27,182 --> 00:46:31,175
爸爸飞走了，他为什么单独留下了小鸟？
The dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone?

614
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:35,289
小鸟试着飞行，但它不会飞
It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to.

615
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:38,352
它要掉下来了
It's going to fall!

616
00:46:43,198 --> 00:46:47,191
你还真是个疯子 一塌糊涂
Proper head case you are. Really messed up.

617
00:46:50,538 --> 00:46:55,532
好，我懂了，小鸟是我 我爸爸离开了，那又怎样
Okay, I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what?

618
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:10,217
听着，亚蒂
Look, Artie, um...

619
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:17,326
只是想给你们制造…
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

620
00:47:17,465 --> 00:47:20,798
美好的心对心谈话的气氛
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

621
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:32,577
我知道对于一件事还没准备好 是一种什么感觉
I know what it's like to not feel ready for something.

622
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:37,248
即使怪物也会觉得担心
Even ogres get scared.

623
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:40,919
你知道…偶尔
You know... once in a while.

624
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:46,690
我知道你要我成为国王，但我不能
I know you want me to be king, but I can't.

625
00:47:46,828 --> 00:47:49,695
我不适合当国王，而且永远也不可能
I'm not cut out for it, and I never will be.

626
00:47:50,598 --> 00:47:53,089
即使我亲身父亲也觉得我一无是处
Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble.

627
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:56,431
他第一时间把我扔到了那个学校
He dumped me at that school first chance he got...

628
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,437
我就再也没有听到过他的消息
...and I never heard from him again.

629
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:04,943
我爸爸也不配做父亲
My dad wasn't really the fatherly type, either.

630
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:07,607
我怀疑他比我的爸爸还差
I doubt he was worse than mine.

631
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:09,746
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

632
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:13,945
我爸爸是个怪物，他想吃掉我
My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me.

633
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,984
我猜我本该意识到的
I guess I should have realized it.

634
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:21,391
他拿烧烤调味酱给我洗澡 拿苹果塞着我的嘴放我在床上
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

635
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:25,789
我想那真是太糟了
I guess that's pretty bad.

636
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:30,331
这也许很难相信…
It may be hard to believe,

637
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:33,929
我那显而易见迷人漂亮的外貌…
what, with my obvious charm and good looks,

638
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:37,010
但在过去一直认为我是个怪物
but people used to think I was a monster.

639
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:40,808
曾经一度，我也相信了他们
And for a long time, I believed them.

640
00:48:42,817 --> 00:48:44,409
但后来
But after a while,

641
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:48,079
你学会了忽视别人怎么称呼你
you learn to ignore the names people call you

642
00:48:48,223 --> 00:48:50,555
只要相信自己
and just trust who you are.

643
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,823
你知道的，你人很好，史莱克
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

644
00:48:56,664 --> 00:49:00,225
你只要稍微减少大吼的次数 多用用肥皂就可以了
You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap.

645
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:03,196
谢谢，亚蒂
Thanks, Artie.

646
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:07,001
肥皂是因为你发臭时…真的是太糟了
The soap's because you stink... really bad.

647
00:49:08,176 --> 00:49:10,667
是啊，我明白了
Yeah... I got that.

648
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:17,549
这地方真是太脏了！
This place is filthy!

649
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:19,444
我感觉自己像是个流浪汉
I feel like a hobo.

650
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:23,452
不好意思，但这地方让我很难受
I'm sorry, but this isn't working for me.

651
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:28,153
你只关心你自己 你的态度不能对我们有任何帮助
Everything's always about you. It's not like your attitude is helping.

652
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:31,993
也许是我被选为国家最美的 这一事实打击了你
Maybe itjust bothers you I was voted fairest in the land.

653
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:34,226
你是说那次作弊的选美？
You mean in that rigged election?

654
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:37,338
得了吧，“莴苣姑娘 莴苣姑娘…
Give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

655
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:40,600
放下你的金色假发！”
...let down thy golden extensions!"

656
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:45,543
女士们，不要再相互抱怨了 我们要齐心协力
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together!

657
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:51,508
我猜这计划就是我们毫无目的的…
So I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly

658
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:53,746
在这臭气熏天的洞里闲逛直到我们腐烂
in this stinkhole until we rot.

659
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:57,415
不，我们要进去，去探明查明的目的
No, we get inside and find out what Oharming's up to.

660
00:49:57,558 --> 00:50:00,254
我知道他是个混蛋
I know he's a jerk and everything,

661
00:50:00,395 --> 00:50:04,559
但查明真是性感
but that Oharming makes me hotter than July.

662
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,231
就是那个！
That's it!

663
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:37,629
快点！这边！
Oome on! This way!

664
00:50:37,765 --> 00:50:38,754
莴苣，等等
Rapunzel, wait!

665
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:50,107
查明，放开她
Oharming, let go of her.

666
00:50:50,244 --> 00:50:52,872
我为什么要那么做？
But why would I want to do that?

667
00:50:58,419 --> 00:50:59,408
什么？
What?

668
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:04,651
女士们，向你们遥远国的新女皇问好
Say hello, ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

669
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,460
莴苣，你怎么能这样？
Rapunzel, how could you?

670
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:12,862
妒忌吧？
Jealous much?

671
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,434
很快你就会回到当初…
Soon you'll be back where you started,

672
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,198
你擦地板，被锁在塔楼里的时代了
scrubbing floors or locked away in towers.

673
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:21,968
我会让你在这里多呆一个礼拜
That is, if I let you last the week.

674
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:26,872
波齐，你答应过不伤害他们的
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

675
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:31,007
等会儿，宝贝，我们晚点再说
Not here, kitten whiskers. Daddy will discuss it later.

676
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,278
见谅，我们要去赶演出
Now forgive us. We have a show to put on.

677
00:51:34,422 --> 00:51:37,687
史莱克很快就回来了 你会后悔的
Shrek will be back soon, and you'll be sorry.

678
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:39,224
后悔？！
Sorry?!

679
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,626
你没意识到只要 史莱克一涉足遥远国…
Don't you realize once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away...

680
00:51:43,765 --> 00:51:45,528
他就完蛋了？
...he's doomed?

681
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:26,699
当心！他们有钢琴！
Look out! They got a piano!

682
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:30,208
把他们全杀了…除了那个胖的
Kill them all... except the fat one.

683
00:52:30,344 --> 00:52:34,713
查明国王有特殊的主意留给你，怪物
King Oharming has something special in mind for you, ogre.

684
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:36,146
查明国王？
King Oharming?

685
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:37,308
攻击！
Attack!

686
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:44,751
亚蒂，蹲下！
Artie, duck!

687
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:00,569
准备好木板！
Ready the plank!

688
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,951
- 史莱克！ - 救命！
- Shrek! - Help!

689
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:38,575
冲啊！
Oowards!

690
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:41,079
查明把菲奥娜怎么了？
What has Oharming done with Fiona?

691
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,809
她已经束手就擒了
She's going to get what's coming to her.

692
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:49,288
你已经无能为力去救她了
And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him!

693
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:51,948
- 我们必须去救她 - 但我们离她太远了！
- We've got to save her. - But she's so far far away!

694
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:55,192
你自己回沃塞斯特雷吧，孩子
Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid.

695
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:58,821
不，史莱克，等等 我有个主意
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

696
00:53:58,966 --> 00:54:01,230
我是个嗡嗡小蜜蜂
I am a buzzing bee.

697
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:05,100
梅林先生？他们需要一个符咒…
Mr. Merlin? They need a spell to get them...

698
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:08,265
我是说我们需要回到遥远国
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

699
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:11,845
没门，我没有那种魔法能力了
Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore.

700
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:15,676
拥抱一下怎样？ 那是最好的魔法
How about a hug? That's the best kind of magic.

701
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:18,182
梅林先生，求你了 我知道你可以的
Please. I know you can do it.

702
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,116
我说了没门！
I said forget it!

703
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:21,585
但…
But...

704
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:30,588
你怎么了？
What's with you?

705
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:35,096
这太难受了，你知道吗？
It's just so hard, you know?

706
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,900
他们需要回去 因为他们的国家正面临困境
They need to get back, 'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

707
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:42,566
因为那里有个坏人
'Oause there's a really bad man.

708
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,473
这太伤心了！
It's just so hard!

709
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:46,739
好了，别激动
Take it easy.

710
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:50,248
不！我想你肯定不理解！
No! I don't think you understand!

711
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:54,912
有个卑鄙的家伙正对 一群好人做着卑鄙的事
There's a mean person doing mean things to good people.

712
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:56,751
发发慈悲吧，老人
Have a heart, old man.

713
00:54:56,891 --> 00:55:01,055
他们真的需要你帮助他们回去 为什么你不愿帮他们呢？！
They really need your help to get back. Why won't you help them?!

714
00:55:04,899 --> 00:55:06,491
好的
Okay.

715
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:08,625
我去拿我的东西
I'll go get my things.

716
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:12,599
小菜一碟
Piece of cake.

717
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,267
那你想要点火腿鸡蛋吗？
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

718
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:20,107
我有点生疏了，因此这可能造成些副作用
I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects.

719
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:21,714
- 副作用？ - 不用担心
- Side effects? - Don't worry.

720
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:25,615
不管什么副作用，无论这有多么痛苦
Whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful,

721
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:28,916
我想最终这副作用会慢慢消失的
it will wear off eventually. I think.

722
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:33,121
- 哦，不 - 你确信？
- Oops. - You sure about this?

723
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,390
如果亚蒂相信他，那我也肯定相信
If Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me.

724
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:39,396
即使他的长袍没有盖住…
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

725
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:42,058
[玛咪玛咪，轰]
Alacritious expeditious...

726
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:44,899
[啊…儒咪！]
...a- zoomy-zoom-zoom!

727
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,872
让我们，帮我们的朋友快…
Let's help our friends get back...

728
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:51,942
回去！
...soon!

729
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:00,878
起作用了！
It worked!

730
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:12,623
自从大学后我就再也没经历过那种旅程了
I haven't been on a trip like that since college!

731
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:14,329
驴子？
Donkey?

732
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:17,301
什么？我牙齿里有什么东西吗？
What? Is something in my teeth?

733
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,734
哦，不！我被咒语弄成了那个二流伙伴了
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

734
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:31,142
至少你看起来不像是某种臃肿的玩偶
At least you don't look like some kind of bloated pinata!

735
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:33,344
你该考虑一下减肥！
You should think about going on a diet!

736
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:38,083
你该给自己弄条内裤 我感觉全都暴露了，很下流！
You should get yourself a pair of pants. I feel all exposed and nasty!

737
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,092
你们两个认为这很有趣吗？
So you two think this is funny?

738
00:56:44,598 --> 00:56:46,395
我真的抱歉，伙计们
I'm really sorry, guys.

739
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:49,002
没关系，你把我们弄回来了，孩子
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

740
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:56,802
在安徒生童话里…
How in the Hans Ohristian Andersen

741
00:56:56,944 --> 00:56:59,708
我也是该穿着这笨重的靴子到处走吗？
am I supposed to parade around in these goofy boots?

742
00:56:59,847 --> 00:57:02,680
嘿，嘿，嘿！小心
Hey, hey, hey! Be very careful with those.

743
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:07,451
他们出自马德里最好的…
They were made in Madrid by the finest...

744
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,113
你会学会怎么控制这个的
You'll learn to control that.

745
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:18,021
真的，哦！你需要些安慰或是支持
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort inserts or arch supports or something.

746
00:57:24,205 --> 00:57:29,074
小心，我走在这儿 并且将一直走下去直到……
Watch it. I'm walking here and I'm gonna keep going until...

747
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,302
匹诺曹！
Pinocchio!

748
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:33,070
史莱克！救我！
Shrek! Help me!

749
00:57:33,214 --> 00:57:36,411
- 发生什么事了？ - 查明和那些恶棍占领了这里！
- What happened? - Oharming and the villains took over!

750
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,316
菲奥娜和公主们走了 现在她…
Fiona and the Princesses got away. Now she's...

751
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:41,978
她怎么了？怎么了？！
She's what?! What?!

752
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:46,156
小猫，借我5块硬币
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

753
00:57:46,293 --> 00:57:48,523
你听到了，帮他出来
You heard him. Help the brother out.

754
00:57:48,662 --> 00:57:50,755
你看到我身上有口袋吗？
Do you see any pockets on me?

755
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:52,729
等等
Hold on a second.

756
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:59,400
我没办法，真的，我…我保证
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

757
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:02,769
快！菲奥娜在哪里？
Quick! Where is Fiona?

758
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:06,676
查明把她关在了什么地方 你必须找到他！
Oharming has her locked away someplace. You have to find him!

759
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:09,681
他可能正在准备演出！
He's probably getting ready for the show!

760
00:58:09,817 --> 00:58:12,149
等等，匹诺曹！什么演出？
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

761
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:19,558
“从此以后过着幸福快乐的生活 ”
"It's a Happily Ever After After All".

762
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:22,025
“史莱克的最后演出”？
"Shrek's final performance"?

763
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:26,293
史莱克！你没告诉我们你会在演出里出现
Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a play!

764
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,891
我想我真是太忙了，忘了提到了
I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it.

765
00:58:30,037 --> 00:58:31,595
是那个怪物！抓住他！
The ogre! Get him!

766
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,272
别担心，老大，我来
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

767
00:58:41,816 --> 00:58:43,443
杀了他！
Uck! Kill it!

768
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:49,582
听着，难道你们不知道他是谁吗？ 你们怎么敢！
Look. Don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you!

769
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:51,247
真是些土人
We're dealing with amateurs.

770
00:58:51,392 --> 00:58:56,329
他是个明星，朋友们！哈罗？ 我很抱歉，史莱克先生
He's a star, people! Hello? I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

771
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:57,987
我要生气了！
I'm going to lose it!

772
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:01,932
都准备好了吗？你得到更衣室的名单了吗？
Is everything ready? You did get the list for the dressing room?

773
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:05,163
早餐是塞有生切金枪鱼片的牛角面包
Breakfast croissant stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.

774
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:08,605
我希望你吃带有蜂蜜黄油的谷物
And I hope you have the saffron corn with jalapeno honey butter.

775
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:11,734
我们的名人没有蜂蜜黄油的话…
Our client cannot get into his proper emotional state

776
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:13,676
会达不到好的状态
withoutjalapeno honey butter!

777
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:15,213
我生气了
I just lost it.

778
00:59:15,983 --> 00:59:18,508
他们该和人力的南希谈谈
They should talk to Nancy in Human Resources.

779
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:22,144
哦，我保证我们有很多话要告诉南希
Oh, we will have much to say to Nancy, I promise!

780
00:59:23,824 --> 00:59:27,521
“用这把剑，我…”，不
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

781
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:31,324
“用这把剑，我将击倒你！”
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

782
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:34,701
“击倒”这个词对吗？“击到”？
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

783
00:59:34,835 --> 00:59:36,700
我不认为有这个词
I don't think that's a word.

784
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:41,171
也许我该“击倒”他，我们再试一下
Maybe I should just "smite" him. Let's try this again. Now...

785
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:45,506
史莱克攻击我，我假装害怕
Shrek attacks me. I pretend to be afraid.

786
00:59:46,247 --> 00:59:50,650
“现在这个国家将从此得到他们应得的幸福 去死吧，怪物！”
"Now the kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

787
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:54,447
哦，感觉不够真实！
Blah, blah, blah. Oh, itjust doesn't feel real enough!

788
00:59:56,357 --> 00:59:58,382
谁要求你停止跳舞？！
Who told you to stop dancing?!

789
00:59:58,525 --> 00:59:59,992
眨眼，转圈
Wink and turn.

790
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:03,358
你躺在那里干吗？起来！老实点！
What are you laying around for? Get up! Honestly!

791
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:15,236
我们从此以后的幸福就要实现了，妈咪
Our happily ever after is nearly complete, Mummy.

792
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,571
我向你保证…
And I assure you...

793
01:00:17,711 --> 01:00:22,705
这个国家的每个人会为 我们等待的每一秒…
...the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second...

794
01:00:23,884 --> 01:00:25,545
付出代价
...we've had to wait.

795
01:00:27,154 --> 01:00:28,587
断腿
Break a leg.

796
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:31,486
再想想，还是我来弄断你条腿吧
On second thought, let me break it for you.

797
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:35,925
谢天谢地，我还以为你不会及时回来了呢
Thank goodness. I was afraid you wouldn't get back in time.

798
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:37,690
菲奥娜在哪里？
Where's Fiona?

799
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:42,063
不要担心，她和其他的人都很安全
Don't worry. She and the others are safe... for now.

800
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:54,578
我猜猜，亚瑟
Let me guess. Arthur.

801
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:57,274
事实上是叫亚蒂
It's Artie, actually.

802
01:00:57,418 --> 01:01:02,412
这孩子就是遥远国的新国王？
This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away?

803
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:05,622
多悲哀啊
How pathetic.

804
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:08,626
不要动，我才不会手发抖
Stand still, so I won't make a mess.

805
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:12,198
查明，住手！我在这里 你得到了你想要的
Oharming, stop! I'm here now. You got what you wanted.

806
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,994
这和他没关系
This isn't about him.

807
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:19,102
那和谁有关？ 我才应该是国王，对吗？
Then who's it about? I'm supposed to be king, right?

808
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:24,810
你其实不是下一任王座的继承人
You weren't really next in line for the throne.

809
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:26,344
我才是
I was.

810
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,813
但你说过国王亲自点名要我继任
But you said the King asked for me personally.

811
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,781
不完全正确
Not exactly.

812
01:01:31,919 --> 01:01:33,352
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

813
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:35,978
该说的我都说了，好了吗？
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

814
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:39,820
我不适合这个位置 因此需要某个傻瓜来代替我
I wasn't right for the job, so I needed some fool to replace me.

815
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,623
而你正好合适，你走吧！
And you fit the bill. So just go!

816
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,759
原来你一直在耍我
You were playing me the whole time.

817
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,665
你理解的很快，孩子
You catch on real fast, kid.

818
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:53,898
也许你不是我想像中的那么失败
Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought.

819
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:02,680
你知道，曾经一度…
You know, for a minute...

820
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:04,716
- 我真的以为… - 什么？
...I actually thought... - What?

821
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:08,344
他在意你？他是个怪物
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

822
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:10,320
你期盼什么呢？
What did you expect?

823
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,327
对付孩子你可真有一套啊，史莱克
You really do have a way with children, Shrek.

824
01:02:36,663 --> 01:02:40,463
Leave me out with the waste

825
01:02:40,601 --> 01:02:43,536
This is not what I do

826
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,367
It's the wrong time

827
01:02:47,508 --> 01:02:50,204
She's pulling me through

828
01:02:50,344 --> 01:02:54,041
It's a small crime

829
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:56,809
And I got no excuse

830
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,350
And is that all right, yeah?

831
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:02,846
Is that all right with you?

832
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:08,024
Is that all right, yeah?

833
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:12,522
If I give my gun away when it's loaded?

834
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:19,365
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it?

835
01:03:22,543 --> 01:03:25,410
Is that all right? Is that all right?

836
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:28,982
Is that all right with you?

837
01:03:29,116 --> 01:03:29,583
No.

838
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:29,981
No.

839
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:32,168
要是我们像我说的呆在原处不动
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

840
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:35,104
我们现在就正拿着心形杯喝茶呢
we'd be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups.

841
01:03:35,242 --> 01:03:36,766
是啊，是啊，心形杯
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

842
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,538
吃着带罗甘莓的煎饼
And eating crumpets smothered with loganberries.

843
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,272
是啊，罗甘莓
Yeah, loganberries.

844
01:03:41,415 --> 01:03:43,280
- 闭嘴，辛迪 - 是啊，闭嘴
- Shut up, Oindy. - Yeah, shut up.

845
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:46,284
- 不，你闭嘴 - 少管闲事
- No, you shut up. - Stay out of this.

846
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,218
谁在乎谁来掌管国家？
Who cares who's "running the kingdom"?

847
01:03:49,356 --> 01:03:52,587
- 我关心 - 你们都该关心
- I care. - You should all care.

848
01:03:56,563 --> 01:03:59,464
我记住你们的徽章编号了，铁罐！
I have your badge number, tin can!

849
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,465
- 驴子？ - 公主！
- Donkey? - Princess!

850
01:04:01,602 --> 01:04:02,591
猫咪？
Puss?

851
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:06,797
我才是猫咪，粘在了这个丑恶的身体里
I am Puss, stuck here inside this hideous body.

852
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,964
我才是我！
And I'm me!

853
01:04:08,108 --> 01:04:09,234
但你是…
But you're...

854
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:12,038
一切都糟透了，事情是这样的
Everything's fruity in the loops, but what happened is

855
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:14,147
我们去了中学，船撞毁了
we went to high school, the boat crashed

856
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:16,841
然后我们一个魔法师施了魔法
and we got bippity-boppity-booped by the magic man.

857
01:04:16,984 --> 01:04:19,179
可怜的家伙
You poor sweet things.

858
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:20,718
我没明白
I don't get it.

859
01:04:20,854 --> 01:04:24,585
这只猫变成了闻起来像臭脚的驴子 什么不明白的？
The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet. What's to get?

860
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:26,090
谁死了？
Who dat?

861
01:04:26,226 --> 01:04:27,250
史莱克呢？
Where's Shrek?

862
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:31,387
查明抓住了他，他计划 今晚在整个国家面前杀了他
Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

863
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:36,963
好了，各位，我们需要找到条出去的路
All right, everyone. We need to find a way out now.

864
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:40,631
你说的对，女士们，各就各位
You're right. Ladies, assume the position!

865
01:04:45,512 --> 01:04:46,706
你们在干吗？
What are you doing?

866
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:48,846
等着被救
Waiting to be rescued.

867
01:04:48,982 --> 01:04:50,950
你在开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

868
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:53,848
我们还能怎么做呢？我们只是四个…
What else can we do? We're just four...

869
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:57,286
我是说三个漂亮的公主
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

870
01:04:57,424 --> 01:05:01,485
两个马戏团小丑，一个怀孕的怪物 还有个老太婆
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady!

871
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:06,663
不好意思，老太婆要爆发了
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

872
01:05:15,275 --> 01:05:17,072
妈妈！
Mom!

873
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:21,477
你认为你没有从你父亲那里 学到了战斗技巧，是吗？
You didn't think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?

874
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:24,345
不好意思，我想那还有一面墙
Excuse me. There's still one more.

875
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:36,860
你先躺下休息一下吧
Why don't you just lie down?

876
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,400
好了，女士们，从这里出去
Okay, girls, from here on out...

877
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:45,004
我们自己管好自己
...we take care of business ourselves.

878
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:06,583
先生们女士们，查明阁下的 遥远国剧场将隆重呈现…
The Far Far Away Theatre at the Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

879
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:08,490
“从此以后过着幸福快乐的生活”
..."It's A Happily Ever After After AII."

880
01:06:08,629 --> 01:06:11,928
市民们，享受这梦幻般的夜晚
Enjoy your evening of theatrical reverie, citizen.

881
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:15,398
剧场里不允许吃零食和饮料
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

882
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:30,614
各就各位！
Places, everyone!

883
01:06:35,756 --> 01:06:36,882
轻点！
Easy!

884
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:40,926
对不起，我想跟小家伙炫耀一下
Sorry. I was showing off for the little one.

885
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:45,257
带了孩子来上班，过来，美女
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day. Oome here, beautiful.

886
01:06:48,435 --> 01:06:51,427
她继承了你的眼睛
Well, she's got your eye.

887
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:57,610
谁会想到像我这种怪物 能拥有像你一样特别的东西呢
Who would have thought a monster like me deserved something as special as you?

888
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:42,292
Little birdies, take wing

889
01:07:43,136 --> 01:07:45,764
Flitting down from the trees they appear

890
01:07:45,906 --> 01:07:48,374
And to chirp in my ear

891
01:07:49,643 --> 01:07:52,635
All because I sing

892
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:23,353
冲啊！冲！
Move it! Go!

893
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,699
我的孩子们！
My babies!

894
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:33,695
救命！
Help!

895
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:21,243
嘿，怎么样？
Hey, how's it goin'?

896
01:09:31,932 --> 01:09:33,866
O到K，危险已经全部清除
O to the K. The coast is clear.

897
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,628
我们行动吧，出去，摧毁小队
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

898
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:40,604
我认为我们已经同意了 使用超级无敌酷这个小队名字
I thought we agreed to use the name Team Super Oool.

899
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,970
我记得是叫帅气小队
I recall it was Team Awesome.

900
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:45,043
我投票选了阿尔法狼中队
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

901
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:47,146
好了，好了！从此以后
Okay! From henceforth,

902
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,410
我们就是阿尔法超级帅气无敌摧毁狼中队
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

903
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:55,783
那边有个奇怪的陌生小女孩盯着我们看
Ach de liebe! There is some strange little girl over there staring at us!

904
01:09:56,723 --> 01:09:58,088
亚蒂！
Artie!

905
01:09:58,225 --> 01:09:59,590
等等，等等！
Wait, wait!

906
01:09:59,726 --> 01:10:01,921
你的怒火呢，先生？
Where is the fire, senor?

907
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:04,087
拜托，别装的那么无辜
Please. Don't act so innocent.

908
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:07,997
你从一开始就知道怎么回事 却一直没说
You both knew what was going on and kept it to yourselves.

909
01:10:08,134 --> 01:10:09,726
事情并不是那样的
It's not like it seems.

910
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,703
不是那样？我认为已经很清楚了
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

911
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:15,364
他在利用我，就是那么回事
He was using me. That's all.

912
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:17,943
利用你？你真的没明白
Using you? You really don't get it.

913
01:10:18,078 --> 01:10:21,070
史莱克是为了保护你才这么说的
Shrek only said those things to protect you.

914
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:26,412
不然查明会杀了你的，亚蒂！ 史莱克救了你的命
Oharming was going to kill you, Artie! Shrek saved your life.

915
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:38,589
灯光对准！
Oue the spot!

916
01:10:42,435 --> 01:10:44,960
我孤独在这儿等待
I wait alone up here

917
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:47,801
被关了又一天
I'm trapped another day

918
01:10:47,941 --> 01:10:51,138
被锁在这里，请让我出去
Locked up here, please set me free

919
01:10:51,278 --> 01:10:54,304
我的新生活我快看见
My new life I almost see

920
01:10:54,447 --> 01:10:57,143
一个城堡，你和我
A castle, you and me

921
01:10:57,284 --> 01:11:02,381
是的，一个城堡，你和我
Yes, a castle, you and me

922
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:05,515
天使！
Oherubs!

923
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:13,262
是的，我在我的帝王战马上
Tis I, Tis I Upon my regal steed

924
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,027
公主，我的爱
Princess, my love

925
01:11:15,168 --> 01:11:17,932
最终你会自由的 我很强壮
At last you shall be freed I'm strong

926
01:11:18,071 --> 01:11:20,039
很勇敢，正赶来救你
And brave And dashing my way there

927
01:11:20,473 --> 01:11:26,139
用我的速度！用我的力量！ 用我那柔软有弹性的头发！
With speed! With might! With soft and bouncy hair!

928
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:30,879
- 穿过恶劣的沙漠 - 炎热！
- Through the blistering desert - Hot!

929
01:11:31,017 --> 01:11:34,043
- 渡过狂暴的大海 - 潮湿！
- Across the stormiest sea - Wet!

930
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:36,178
面对如此恶劣的生物
Facing creatures so vile

931
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:37,449
恶心！
Foul!

932
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:41,721
这样你就有机会注视着我
So you can gaze upon me!

933
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:45,361
我知道你会来救我
I knew you'd come for me

934
01:11:45,498 --> 01:11:49,332
现在我们终于见面了
And now we finally meet

935
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:50,936
我知道你会等
I knew you'd wait

936
01:11:51,071 --> 01:11:55,599
会接受我的爱
And from my plate of love you'd eat

937
01:12:15,528 --> 01:12:18,861
这个丑陋的魔鬼是谁？ 谁敢如此粗鲁的来干涉？
Who is this terribly ugly fiend Who so rudely intervened?

938
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:20,830
查明会战斗还是逃跑？
Will Charming fight or flee?

939
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:22,025
请救我！
Please rescue me!

940
01:12:22,168 --> 01:12:23,863
救我离开这个怪物！
From this monstrosity!

941
01:12:24,004 --> 01:12:29,032
你别怕，亲爱的！ 我会把这怪物切成肉片
Fear thee not, honey lamb! I will slice this thing up like a ham!

942
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,677
哦，孩子
Oh, boy.

943
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:35,406
你将进入一个你…
You are about to enter a world of pain

944
01:12:35,548 --> 01:12:39,882
从未感受过的痛苦世界
With which you are not familiar!

945
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:47,726
没有比你的拙劣表演更痛苦的了
It can't be any more painful than your lousy performance.

946
01:12:51,398 --> 01:12:53,389
“受死吧，恶心的怪物”
"Prepare, foul beast."

947
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:58,767
受死吧，恶心的怪物，你的死期已到
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

948
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:02,068
你能不能先杀了我然后再唱？
Oould you kill me and then sing?

949
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:05,271
安静！
Be quiet!

950
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:09,542
我只是和你开玩笑 那真是个漂亮的连衣裤
I'm just having fun with you. That's actually a very nice leotard.

951
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:10,945
谢谢
Thank you.

952
01:13:11,084 --> 01:13:13,177
是照男人的尺寸来做的吗？
Do they come in men's sizes?

953
01:13:16,256 --> 01:13:17,985
真好笑啊
Now that be funny!

954
01:13:18,124 --> 01:13:20,092
够了！
Enough!

955
01:13:22,495 --> 01:13:26,295
现在你终于知道…
Now you'll finally know what it's like...

956
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:29,960
对你来说宝贵的东西被夺走…
...to have everything you worked for...

957
01:13:30,103 --> 01:13:34,130
是一种什么感觉了
...everything that's precious to you, taken away.

958
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:37,607
现在你会知道我是什么感觉
Now you'll know how I felt.

959
01:13:44,951 --> 01:13:46,612
香肠卷
Sausage roll!

960
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,495
祈求猫咪的仁慈吧！
Pray for mercy from Puss!

961
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:08,129
还有驴子！
And Donkey!

962
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:09,379
D

963
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,682
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, honey.

964
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,847
对不起，我们来晚了，你还好吗？
Sorry we're late. You okay?

965
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:27,323
你在这里好多了
Much better, now that you're here.

966
01:14:29,996 --> 01:14:35,195
那么，查明，你想放开我 让我们进行真正的怪物对男人的决斗吗？
So, Oharming, you want to let me out of these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

967
01:14:35,335 --> 01:14:39,669
哦，那听上去很有趣 但我有个更好的主意
Ooh, that sounds fun. But I have a better idea.

968
01:14:55,522 --> 01:14:57,922
不！放开我！
No! Let go of me!

969
01:14:58,057 --> 01:15:02,187
这次不会让你毁了一切的，怪物 杀了他
You will not ruin things this time, ogre. Kill it.

970
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:07,795
大家，住手！
Everybody, stop!

971
01:15:09,636 --> 01:15:11,729
哦，又是什么？！
Oh, what is it now?!

972
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,133
亚蒂？
Artie?

973
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:25,284
谁说我们必须要以这种方式解决问题？
Who thinks we need to settle things this way?

974
01:15:29,556 --> 01:15:33,253
你们想一生都做恶棍吗？
You mean you want to be villains your whole lives?

975
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:37,193
但我们就是恶棍！ 这是我们唯一所明白的
But we are villains! It's the only thing we know.

976
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,764
你从没希望做别的什么吗？
You never wish you could be something else?

977
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:43,357
你说的容易，你又不是给施了魔法的树
Easy for you to say. You're not some evil enchanted tree.

978
01:15:43,503 --> 01:15:46,267
你个蠢人！别听他的！攻击！
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

979
01:15:46,406 --> 01:15:49,204
斯蒂夫的意思是如果全世界都讨厌你
What Steve means is it's hard to come by honest work

980
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:51,367
那么很难得到好工作
when the whole world's against you.

981
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:53,240
对的，谢谢，爱德
Right. Thanks, Ed.

982
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:57,782
很公平，你说的对 我不是棵会说话的树
Fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree.

983
01:15:57,917 --> 01:15:59,009
但你要知道…
But you know...

984
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:02,280
一个好朋友曾经告诉我…
...a good friend once told me...

985
01:16:02,422 --> 01:16:07,450
别人对待你像对待恶棍…
...just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre...

986
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:09,585
或是怪物，或者像对待一个失败者
...orjust some loser...

987
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:12,997
这并不意味你就是
...doesn't mean you are one.

988
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:19,737
最重要的是你自己怎么看你自己
What matters most is what you think of yourself.

989
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:24,173
如果有什么你真的想要的 或是你想成为的…
If there's something you really want, or someone you want to be...

990
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:27,939
唯一能阻拦你的就是你自己
...the only person standing in your way is you.

991
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:30,211
- 我自己？ - 抓住他！
- Me? - Get him!

992
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,749
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

993
01:16:31,885 --> 01:16:34,820
我的意思是你们每个人…
What I mean is each of you...

994
01:16:34,954 --> 01:16:37,218
都有自己的路
...is standing in your own way.

995
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:43,618
我一直想演奏长笛
I always wanted to play the flute.

996
01:16:43,763 --> 01:16:47,426
我想要在法国开个温泉浴场
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

997
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:52,129
我想种水仙花，很漂亮的
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

998
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:44,016
一个新的时代终于来临了！
A new era finally begins!

999
01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:47,519
现在你们…
Now all of you...

1000
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:50,761
向你们的国王鞠躬！
...bow before your King!

1001
01:17:57,203 --> 01:17:59,535
你需要练习一下瞄准
You need to work on your aim.

1002
01:18:01,874 --> 01:18:04,741
这本该是我的幸福生活！
This was supposed to be my happily ever after!

1003
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:07,368
那我想你需要继续寻找了…
Well, you need to keep looking...

1004
01:18:09,382 --> 01:18:11,441
因为我不会放弃我的幸福生活
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1005
01:18:16,723 --> 01:18:17,883
妈咪？
Mommy?

1006
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:31,396
如果你想要就给你了
It's yours if you want it.

1007
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:34,403
但这次你自己选择
But this time it's your choice.

1008
01:18:57,096 --> 01:18:58,120
亚瑟！
Author!

1009
01:18:58,264 --> 01:19:01,597
亚蒂！亚蒂！亚蒂！
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1010
01:19:05,938 --> 01:19:08,930
不好意思，那是我的座位
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1011
01:19:09,942 --> 01:19:14,709
好了，大魔法师先生 现在是时候纠正错误了！
Okay, Senor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time has come to rectify some wrongs!

1012
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:17,372
尽管我很享受猫的沐浴
Though I have been enjoying these cat baths.

1013
01:19:17,517 --> 01:19:19,007
请说你不喜欢
Please say you didn't.

1014
01:19:19,152 --> 01:19:21,052
好的！听着
All right! Look.

1015
01:19:21,187 --> 01:19:24,486
你们可能会感到被掐了一下 也许还会肠子不舒服
You'll feel a pinch and possibly lower intestinal discomfort...

1016
01:19:24,624 --> 01:19:26,956
但这应该有效
...but this should do the trick.

1017
01:19:31,197 --> 01:19:33,665
- 是你吗？ - 我又变回我自己啦！
- Are you? - I'm me again!

1018
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,064
- 我不再是你啦！ - 好啦！
- And I am not you! - All right!

1019
01:19:37,637 --> 01:19:38,797
唉
Oops.

1020
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:42,206
啊，没关系
Ah, never mind.

1021
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:50,273
我怎么告诉你的？ 这孩子会成为一个伟大的国王
What did I tell you? The kid's going to be a great king.

1022
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,977
确实，你本来也会是的
Well, for what it's worth, you would have, too.

1023
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:58,480
我心里还有更重要的事情
I have something much more important in mind.

1024
01:20:24,016 --> 01:20:25,244
最终
Finally.

1025
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:33,355
爸爸
Dada.

1026
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:39,810
Was I wrong about the world? It's a beautiful new place

1027
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:42,457
嘿嘿，我闻到了小史莱克的味道！
I smell Shrek Junior!

1028
01:20:42,582 --> 01:20:45,244
Where else could a creep like me

1029
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:48,114
Meet such a pretty face

1030
01:20:48,254 --> 01:20:52,190
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1031
01:20:54,994 --> 01:20:57,895
Looking up, it's looking like

1032
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:00,692
My losing streak is done

1033
01:21:01,601 --> 01:21:02,898
Peek-a-boo!

1034
01:21:03,035 --> 01:21:04,366
Peek-a-boo!

1035
01:21:07,593 --> 01:21:09,424
跳啊，跳，宝贝
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1036
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,238
Used to always feel like

1037
01:21:12,378 --> 01:21:15,040
Wished that I was dressed better

1038
01:21:16,068 --> 01:21:17,729
婴儿在哪里？
Where's the baby?

1039
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:22,219
Never had a lot of luck Until I finally met her

1040
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:35,724
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1041
01:21:38,404 --> 01:21:40,565
Looking up, it's looking like

1042
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,073
My losing streak is done

1043
01:21:46,245 --> 01:21:48,577
My losing streak is done

1044
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:02,107
那…我们现在该干吗呢？
Well... what shall we do now?

1045
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,791
我来吧
I got it.

1046
01:22:26,285 --> 01:22:30,654
Puss and Donkey, baby! Once again, come on!

1047
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:35,420
I want to thank you for letting me be myself

1048
01:22:35,561 --> 01:22:36,653
Again!

1049
01:22:36,796 --> 01:22:38,661
Look at my hips!

1050
01:22:38,798 --> 01:22:43,997
I want to thank you for letting me be myself

1051
01:22:44,136 --> 01:22:45,626
Again!

1052
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,434
- Break it down! - Let's go!

1053
01:22:52,578 --> 01:22:54,978
Stiff all in the collar

1054
01:22:56,816 --> 01:22:58,977
Fluffy in the face

1055
01:23:01,153 --> 01:23:03,644
Chit chat chatter trying

1056
01:23:04,991 --> 01:23:07,152
Stuffy in the place

1057
01:23:09,328 --> 01:23:12,161
Thank you for the par-tay

1058
01:23:13,332 --> 01:23:15,197
But I could never stay

1059
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,665
I'm sorry.

1060
01:23:17,336 --> 01:23:20,328
I got many things on my mind

1061
01:23:21,674 --> 01:23:23,835
But the word's in the way

1062
01:23:24,844 --> 01:23:30,043
And I want to thank you for letting me be myself

1063
01:23:30,182 --> 01:23:31,513
Again

1064
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:34,486
Different strokes for different folks

1065
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:38,215
Thank you for letting me be myself

1066
01:23:38,357 --> 01:23:39,847
Again

1067
01:23:42,028 --> 01:23:43,518
Break it down!

1068
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:47,693
Puss and Donkey, baby! Puss and Donkey, baby!

1069
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,861
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1070
01:23:51,203 --> 01:23:53,364
Dance to the music

1071
01:23:55,207 --> 01:23:57,539
All night long

1072
01:23:59,545 --> 01:24:01,877
Everyday people

1073
01:24:03,549 --> 01:24:05,710
Sing a simple song

1074
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,211
Mama's so happy

1075
01:24:12,058 --> 01:24:14,049
Mama start to cry

1076
01:24:16,228 --> 01:24:18,719
Papa's still singing

1077
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:23,391
You can make it if you try So try!

1078
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:28,438
Thank you for letting me be myself

1079
01:24:28,574 --> 01:24:29,905
Again

1080
01:24:32,912 --> 01:24:36,780
Thank you for letting me be myself

1081
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,611
Again

1082
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:41,618
Oome on, Donkey. Do something right!

1083
01:24:41,754 --> 01:24:44,154
Put the hoofs together! Put the hoofs together!

1084
01:24:45,257 --> 01:24:49,455
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby!

1085
01:24:49,595 --> 01:24:53,463
Thank you for letting me be myself

1086
01:24:53,599 --> 01:24:55,089
Again

1087
01:24:57,269 --> 01:25:01,797
I want to thank you for letting me be myself

1088
01:25:01,941 --> 01:25:03,033
Again

1089
01:25:03,175 --> 01:25:06,144
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1090
01:25:06,278 --> 01:25:09,475
Want to thank you Just to be my

Because I just want to be my... See?

1092

Yes! Yes!
