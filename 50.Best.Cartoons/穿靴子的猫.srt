你要想死就去杰克和吉尔那里偷吧
Only a cat with a death wish would steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

63
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,780
我想的只是还一笔旧债
The only wish I have is to repay an old debt.

赠送的早餐要欧式的

还有别想在小松饼上给我减料

You know, Jill, I been thinking.

快说吧
Get it out.

74

我等魔豆这票干完了
I... Once we're done with this magic bean business

75
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,540
拿到了值钱的金蛋
and got ourselves all them beautiful golden eggs...

76
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,040

Go on.

77
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,960
我们不要再继续抢劫和杀人了
That we cut down on some of the hijacking and murdering.

78
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,710
我知道这样很好玩 但是...
I mean, it's fun and all, but...

79
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,090
我想要个孩子
...I want a baby.

80
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,230
- 什么孩子 杰克?  - 我们的孩子 吉尔
- A baby what, Jack?  - A baby us, Jill.

81
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,270
我们会把他抚养得很狂野 就像松鼠似的
We'll raise it wild, like a squirrel or something.

82
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,030
我的豆豆啊 它们是真的
Holy frijoles! They do exist.

83
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,950
自打你从山上跌下来摔坏了下巴
Ever since you fell down that hill and broke your crown,

84
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,620
你就开始说胡话了

嘿 在搞什么?
Hey! What gives?

你你你 呆在哪儿别动!

没什么

我不懂鹰语
No hablo ingles.

95
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,530
你要为此付出代价!
You are going to pay for this!

96
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,310
不!
No!

97
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,950
卓柏卡布拉!
Chupacabra!

98
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,950
卓柏卡布拉! 卓柏卡布拉!

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,530
- 卓柏卡布拉!  - 你脑子被驴踢了!
- Chupacabra!  - You are a crazy woman!

100
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,590
这些魔豆是我的猎物
Those magic beans were my score!

101
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,840
你害我失去了得到金蛋的良机 伙计
You just cost me a chance at getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.

102
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,100

103
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,870

既然是比舞决斗
If it is to be a dance fight,

够胆的话 畏惧我吧

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,130
你用吉他打我的头?!
You hit me in the head with a guitar?!

112
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,220
你是母猫?
You are a woman?

113
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,180
真不专业
Amateur.

114
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,560
哇!
Wow!

115
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,940
小姐 等等!
Senorita, wait!

116
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,990
能赏脸让我请你喝杯奶吗? 我很有爱 并不暴力
Let me buy you some leche! I am a lover, not a fighter.

117
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,240
有人吗?
Hello?

118
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,290
在和我躲猫猫吗?
You are hiding from me?

119
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,040
我也很喜欢玩游戏哦
I like to play the games, too.

120
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,250
我感觉我们气味相投啊
I sense in you a kindred spirit, a...

121
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,260
这气味很熟悉
I smell something familiar.

122
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,180
闻起来很危险
Something... dangerous.

123
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,810
闻起来像早餐
Something...breakfasty.

124
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,230
很久不见啊 兄弟
It's been a long time, brother.

125
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,940
该死的蛋!
Maldito huevo.

126
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,240
矮蛋・亚历山大
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

127
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,410
你怎敢出现在我面前
How dare you show your face to me.

128
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,080
我知道你很生气 你应该生气
I know you're angry. You have every right.

129
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,760
但我真的很高兴见到你 猫
But it is good to see you, Puss.

130
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,340
穿的新靴子吗?
Are those new boots?

131
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,090
不! 还是你出卖我时穿的那双
No! They are the same boots I wore when you betrayed me.

132
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,680
背叛你?
Betrayed you?

133
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,310
你留下心碎的我在那座桥上 还被卫兵围捕
You left me cracked in pieces on a bridge, surrounded by soldiers!

134
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,730
他们还为此写了首歌
They wrote a song about it!

135
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,060
那我们是为什么会到那座桥上的?!
And how did we get on that bridge in the first place?!

136
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,110
因为我们是兄弟 而兄弟就应该互相照顾对方
Because we were brothers, and brothers are supposed to look after each other...

137
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,440
矮蛋!
Humpty!

138
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
不要把正事忘了
Remember why we're here.

139
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,370
我早该料到
I should have known.

140
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,450
魔豆当时已经在我掌控中
I had the magic beans in my grasp,

141
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,290
而你派这只小魅魔来干涉我
and you sent this very attractive devil woman to interfere.

142
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,290
你就是我一生的诅咒
You are a curse on my life!

143
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,050
等等 听我说完 好吗?
Wait. Hear me out. OK?

144
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,760
对 没错 我让咪咪带你来这里
Yes, yes, I sent Kitty to bring you here.

145
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,090
但她不是一般的窃贼
But she is no ordinary thief.

146
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,550
她是咪・柔爪
She's Kitty Softpaws.

147
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,890
有全西班牙最柔软的爪子
The softest touch in Spain.

148
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,020
男的穿这样高的根不舒服吧 不是吗?
That's a lot of heel for a guy, don't you think?

149
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,980
听好 有着咪的手段 你的剑术和我的头脑
Look, with Kitty's skill, your sword and my brain,

150
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,730
我们有了千载难逢的机会啊
we've got a fighting chance here.

151
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,820
猫 拜托 你们都知道没人能从
Puss, come on, you of all people know that nobody's ever ripped off

152
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,530
巨人的城堡里偷走东西还能活着回来的
the giant's castle and lived to tell the tale.

153
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,950
你想全身而退 就得有计划
You want to survive? You need a plan.

154
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,500
而我一生都在计划这件事 你知道的
And I've studied this job my whole life. You know that.

155
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,790
我们真诚相待
Let's be honest.

156
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,460
没有我你也不知道在哪里种魔豆 猫
Without me, you don't even know where to plant the beans, Puss.

157
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,880
但杰克和吉尔知道 他们已经启程了
But Jack and Jill do. They're on their way.

158
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,310
通缉犯爬上豆茎 下来就成了传奇
We go up the beanstalk outlaws, and we come down legends.

159
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,310
你意见如何?
So what do you say?

160
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,310
伙计?
Partners?

161
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,980
不 我不会再上当
No. Never again.

162
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,490
对不起 好没? 你这仇要记恨多久啊?
I'm sorry, OK? How long are you gonna hold a grudge?

163
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,830
都七年了! 差不多三十五个猫年了
It's been seven years! That's like 35 cat years.

164
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,500
你需要我! 而且我需要你
You need me! And I need you.

165
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,630
猫! 你知道在圣里卡多的监狱里 他们怎么对蛋的吗?
Puss! You got any idea what they do to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

166
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,010
我来告诉你 朋友
I'll tell you this, my friend.

167
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,010
可不像煎蛋那么简单
It ain't over easy.

168
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,690
再见 矮蛋!
Adios... Humpty Dumpty.

169
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,860
哦 糟糕了 糟糕了
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

170
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,370
别担心 我来对付他 我也是只猫猫哦
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. I know how to speak meow.

171
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,240
你用扭曲的谎言编造出悲惨的故事
...sad story with your twisted lies

172
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,290
还有你那油腻腻的蛋壳 闻起来像发霉的火腿!
in your greasy shell that smells like old ham!

173
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,670
我该当场把你敲碎!
I should crack you open for...

174
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,550
看看我找到啥了
Look what I found.

175
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,560
有人忘记拿钱包哦
Someone forgot his money.

176
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,730
哦 你真是很危险
Oh, you are dangerous.

177
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,650
矮蛋说你喜欢冒险
Humpty says you like danger.

178
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,490
想想看 我们会遇到的危险
Just think of all the trouble we can get into.

179
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,750
我们俩 一起
The two of us together.

180
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,920
我们能拿到不少的金蛋
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

181
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,430
而且...你欠我的
And... you owe me.

182
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,930
我欠你啥?
I owe you?

183
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,100
你用吉他打了我
You hit me in the head with a guitar.

184
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,270
吉他很后悔
I regret the guitar.

185
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,940
好吧 我原谅你
OK, I forgive you.

186
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,440
那你加入吗?
So... you're in?

187
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,780
只有一个很小的微不足道的小问题
There is one teeny, tiny, itty-bitty problem.

188
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,610
是什么呢?
And what is that?

189
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,780
你的老板是矮蛋!
You work for the egg!

190
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,120
拜托啊 猫 你和矮蛋之间到底发生了什么天大的事?
Oh, come on, Puss. What happened between you and Humpty that was so bad?

191
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,420
恐怕我们俩之间伤痕太深了
I am afraid with me and Humpty... the scars are too deep.

192
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,930
那是多年前的事情了
It all started a long time ago.

193
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,890
不! 你大可不必把整件事情都说完
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me your whole life story, please.

194
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,890
请坐下 我详说
You may want to sit.

195
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,150
那是一段悲痛的日子
It is at times quite... painful.

196
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,150
好吧 开始了
OK, here we go.

197
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,650
那是闹旱灾的一年
It was a year in which the rain had not fallen.

198
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,160
大风呼啸 猫篮羸小
The wind was big and the basket was small.

199
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,580
随风颠簸 饥寒难消
For days, I bounced along...

200
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,500
没有妈妈 没有酒吧
...a hungry little kitten with no milk, no mama,

201
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,500
没有24小时奶喝的家
and no litter box.

202
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:42,170
直到我来到一个收留孤儿的地方
Until I came to rest at a home for lost children.

203
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,680
她的名字是伊梅尔达
Her name was Imelda.

204
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,310
如同母亲一般用心对待我 如同亲生儿子一般
And, like a mother, she took me into her heart and raised me as her own.

205
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,770
都安静
Silencio.

206
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,730
安静
Silencio.

207
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,110
她像天使般的温柔善良
She was an angel of kindness.

208
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,200
安静!
Silencio!

209
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,450
大多数时候吧
Most of the time.

210
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,200
我要给大家介绍一个新来的同学
I'd like to introduce a new boy joining us.

211
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,040
没事的 孩子 和大家见见面吧
It's OK, pequeno. You show with the face.

212
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,300
去吧
Go on.

213
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,140
就是那时我认识了...
And that was the moment I met...

214
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,270
矮蛋・亚历山大
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

215
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,850
长毛的 你坐在了蓝小子的座位上
Hey, Whiskers! You're sitting in Little Boy Blue's chair.

216
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,480
哦 拜托 这有必要吗?
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

217
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,650
怎么不找个和你一样块头的欺负?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

218
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,610
谁问你了 早餐?
Who asked you, Breakfast?

219
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,280
还记得伊美尔达怎么说的吗 蓝小子?
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue

220
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,530
如果你怒发冲天 就用力吹你的号角 不是吗?
If you're going to blow your top, you blow your horn instead, right?

221
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,950
我们来玩转蛋蛋吧
Let's spin him.

222
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,370
请别转我 不要转我!
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

223
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,950
不要再转了! 不要! 我会散黄的!
Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

224
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,790
虽然他拿了我的豆子 但他为我挺身而出
Even though he took my beans, the egg stood up for me,

225
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,750
那时我就决定了
and I decided then...

226
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,340
我要永远保护他
...that I would always have his back.

227
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,760
哇哦!
Wow!

228
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,270
你真是太厉害了 谢谢
That was very impressive. Thanks!

229
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,850
蛋蛋男!
Hey, egg boy!

230
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,860
但这只奇怪的蛋总是让我好奇
There was something about this strange little egg that intrigued me.

231
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,250
是你啊 我收集豆子都好几个月了
Oh... it's you. I've been collecting for months now.

232
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,880
你总不知道运气什么时候来 明白吗?
You never know when you're gonna get lucky. You know what I mean?

233
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,300
魔豆 就是我要找的
Magic beans... is what they are.

234
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,930
喂?
Hello?

235
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,890
你要向其他的孩子说我相信魔法吗?
You gonna tell all the other kids that I believe in magic now?

236
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,850
你正打算这样吗?
Is that what you're gonna do?

237
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,480
不吗? 你叫什么名字?
No? What's your name?

238
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,650
你不怎么说话 对吧?
You don't say much, do you?

239
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,240
我觉得就叫你闪闪
I think I'll call you Sparky.

240
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,570
毛毛?
Whiskers?

241
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,990
索尔塔!
Zoltar!

242
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,410
那叫"猫"怎么样?
How about Puss?

243
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,620
他脑子里都是各种的幻想和冒险
Humpty's mind was full of imagination and invention.

244
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,420
那边十五尺高的那是什么?
What is that, 50 feet down there?

245
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,130
这就来吧 帮我...
Here we go. Give me a...

246
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,000
猫!
Puss!

247
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,720
猫 快看我 我在飞!
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

248
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,350
他总是说着超乎我想象的传说和冒险
He spoke of legends and adventures beyond my wildest dreams.

249
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,890
当我找到那些魔法豆后
When I find those magic beans, they'll grow a vine

250
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,150
让它们长到云里
straight up into the clouds,

251
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,650
在那里有着可怕残忍的巨人 守护他最宝贵的宝藏
where a terrible and a fearsome giant hoards his greatest treasure...

252
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,320
黄金之鹅
...the Golden Goose.

253
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,780
黄金鹅 只要一颗
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

254
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,580
只要一颗她产下的金蛋 就够我一生享用了
Just one of her golden eggs... could set me for life.

255
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,250
这是我的使命 猫
It's my destiny, Puss.

256
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,420
我不知道怎么解释 但我总觉得我属于那里的世界
I can't really explain it, but I just feel like I belong up there.

257
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,590
哦 小子 这有些难为情
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

258
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
这只是我个人的梦想
This is kind of a solo dream here.

259
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,770
我的确不需要什么累赘 知道吗? 拖后腿的人
I don't need any dead weight, you know, holding me down.

260
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,890
你这是干什么?
What are you doing?

261
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,570
我的天 太棒了 你眼睛的把戏 实在太棒了
Oh, man, that's good. The eye thing that you're doing, that is really splendid.

262
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,610
好了 让我再想一想 好吗?
OK, let me just think for a second. All right... OK.

263
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,540
这太疯狂了 但我在想...想要一个搭档
This is crazy, but I am considering a partnership.

264
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,040
但我还要知道一件事
I just need to know one thing.

265
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,420
你能保证吗?
Can you commit?

266
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,790
好 我能保证
Si... I can commit.

267
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,380
你能说话啊 能帮我起来吗?
Oh, you can talk! Could you help me up?

268
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,970
没问题
OK...

269
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,140
魔豆帮帮规第一条
First rule of Bean Club...

270
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,480
不能谈起魔豆帮
...you do not talk about Bean Club.

271
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,730
魔豆帮帮规第二条
Second rule of Bean Club...

272
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,940
还是不能谈起魔豆帮
...is you don't talk about Bean Club.

273
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,190
- 准备好了?  - 好了
- You ready?  - Ready.

274
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,690
从今天开始到永远 我们会
From this day forth, it shall be known...

275
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,030
永不落单 团结一致
Never alone, always together...

276
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,530
矮蛋和猫
Humpty and Puss...

277
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,330
永是兄弟
Brothers forever.

278
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,790
从那时起
And from that moment on,

279
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,120
我们一起展开了伟大的冒险:寻找魔豆
we were united on a great adventure to find the magic beans.

280
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,380
扶我
Help me up.

281
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,040
贴蛋
Egg me.

282
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,300
矮蛋就是主脑
Humpty was the brains...

283
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,920
- 我的天啊!  - 我根本没看到他
- Good gracious!  - I never saw him!

284
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,640
- 真的好疼啊!  - 而我就是执行者
- That really hurt!  - ...and I was the skill.

285
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,140
我要碎了!
I'm cracked!

286
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,060
我们得到了红豆 绿豆 咖啡豆和利马豆...但没有魔豆
We got red beans, green beans, coffee beans, lima beans... but no magic beans.

287
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,150
要果冻豆吗?
Would you care for a jelly bean?

288
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,480
要 谢谢
Thank you.

289
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,490
寻找魔豆就是我们的一切
Finding them meant everything to us.

290
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,660
哦 我差点忘了最重要的哦
Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing.

291
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,910
那就是我和你 猫
That's me and you, Puss.

292
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,910
我和你
Me and you.

293
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,580
但我们从没找到
But we never did find them.

294
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,000
一年一年过去了 寻找魔豆的任务
And, as years passed, the quest for magic beans

295
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,420
越来越像孩子的梦想了
seemed more and more like the dreams of a child.

296
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,510
青年时 矮蛋和我总是惹事...
As teenagers, Humpty and I looked for trouble...

297
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,850
而结果就是
and often found it.

298
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,180
这个月第三次了 伊梅尔达 下一次我直接送监狱了
Third time this month, Imelda. Next time is jail time.

299
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,560
他们还是孩子啊
They're just kids.

300
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,350
他们是小偷!
They are thieves.

301
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,190
你们能有更大的作为
You are better than this.

302
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,530
我一直从心里相信这点
I believe in you with all my heart.

303
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,450
请不要让我失望
Please do not let me down.

304
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,790
我讨厌这地方 我等不及要离开这里了
I hate this place. I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

305
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,590
扔石头吧 能让你好受些
Throw a rock. It'll make you feel better.

306
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,630
天啊 该走了
Oh, boy. We should go.

307
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,720
出于本能 我行动了
On instinct, I reacted.

308
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,690
他救了卫队长的妈妈
He saved the Comandante's mother!

309
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,200
他救了卫队长的妈妈
He saved the Comandante's mother!

310
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,440
他救了卫 队长的妈妈


311
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,660
你救了我妈妈
You saved my mother.

312
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,420
猫先生...他是位英雄!
Senor Puss... he is a hero!

313
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,090
今天我们看到了勇气和胆量
Today we see that courage and bravery come in all sizes!

314
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,800
那时我也不知道 我的人生在那时起就改变了
Little did I know that one moment would change my whole life.

315
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,560
这是给你的 我的孩子
These are for you, my boy.

316
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,600
穿上它们 代表着荣誉和正义
Wear them as a symbol of honor... and justice.

317
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,520
我会让你骄傲的 妈妈
I will make you proud, Mama.

318
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,740
你已经让我骄傲了 穿靴子的猫
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

319
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,280
一只猫穿靴子有多奇怪啊
How strange it was to give a cat boots...

320
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,620
但我看起来真帅
...but, whoa... I looked good!

321
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,620
当我的人生路越来越明亮时
And as the light of my path grew brighter...

322
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,130
而他的人生路却越来越阴暗
...Humpty's road grew ever darker.

323
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,300
谢谢你 卫队长
Gracias, Comandante.

324
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,890
小心选择你的伙伴
Be careful of the company you keep.

325
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,060
我知道 我知道我不该独自行动
I know! I know, I never should've tried something without you.

326
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,730
你不能再去偷棒棒糖了 矮蛋 我是说真的
You're not stealing lollipops any more, Humpty. This is getting serious.

327
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,270
你说的对 我们应该做更精明的事
You're right! We have to be smarter about this.

328
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,650
听我说 我们要想得更远大
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

329
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,570
我已经侦查过银匠铺了 很完美
I've been casing the silversmith and it's perfect.

330
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,200
你和我只需要不到一分钟就完事
You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops.

331
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,990
快把本子收起来! 这是我们家
Will you put that away! This is our home.

332
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,790
这些人没做过任何对不起我们的事
These people have done nothing to us.

333
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,420
我们家? 好了 我明白了
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

334
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,000
你有了双好靴子 你就比我强了?
You get some fancy boots and now you're too good for me?

335
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,550
不是那么回事
That is not true.

336
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,800
我们不在这儿出生 我们是孤儿
We weren't born here. We're orphans!

337
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,760
我们只能相依为命 明白吗?
All we got is each other, you understand?

338
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,550
我们能更有作为
We are better than this.

339
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,470
但我们是搭档啊
But we're partners.

340
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,680
我们是兄弟
We are brothers.

341
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,150
但我不会再偷东西了
But I am not stealing anymore.

342
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,440
但矮蛋却没那么容易放弃
But Humpty would not give up so easily.

343
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,280
我有麻烦了 猫
I'm in trouble, Puss!

344
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,650
是蓝小子的一个混混 我欠他一笔钱
It's Boy Blue and his gang. I owe them some money.

345
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,030
他们要来找我了 快帮我翻过这道墙
They're coming for me. Just get me over this wall.

346
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,660
我们快走! 帮我翻墙 快点!
I gotta go. Help me up the wall. Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

347
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,500
圣里卡多银行


348
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,970
好了 东西拿齐了 成功了 快走 走!
OK, I've got everything. We did it. Come on, let's go!

349
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,630
你怎么能这样对我?!
How could you do this to me?!

350
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,260
我帮了你大忙啊 我们终于可以离开这里了
I did you a favor! We can finally get out of here!

351
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,140
 这可是大家的钱啊 是他们所有的积蓄
This is the money of the people! This is all they have!

352
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,650
你!让这双靴子蒙羞!
You disgrace those boots!

353
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,690
卫队长!求求你 让我解释
Comandante, please, I can explain!

354
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,070
抓住他们!
Arrest them!

355
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,370
快! 到桥那儿!
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

356
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,700
- 你骗我!  - 我必须骗你 你让我别无选择
- You tricked me!  - I had to! You left me no choice!

357
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,750
妈妈
Mama...

358
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,760
我的孩子
Pequeno.

359
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,670
看路!
Watch out!

360
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,440
哦 不
Oh, no.

361
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,610
猫 我起不来
Puss. I can't get up.

362
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,990
帮帮我 我起不来
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

363
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,490
站住!
Freeze!

364
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,080
猫 救救我!
Puss, save me!

365
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,200
自己救自己吧
Save yourself.

366
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,580
我们需要你
We got you.

367
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,180
在那一天 我失去了我在乎的一切
I lost everything I cared about that day.

368
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,020
我的兄弟
My brother.

369
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,690
 我的荣誉
My honor.

370
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,190
 我的家
My home.

371
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,440
我能想到的是 妈妈眼里深深的失望
All I thought about was the disappointment in my mama's eyes.

372
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,360
从那时起我就在逃亡
And I have been running ever since.

373
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,870
那颗蛋背叛了我
The egg betrayed me.

374
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,710
他的谎言 让我失去一切
His lies cost me everything.

375
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,710
- 嘿!  - 我没睡!
- Hey!  - I'm awake!

376
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,010
你以为我不想弥补过去吗?
You think I don't want to fix the past?

377
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,100
我下不来
I can't get down.

378
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,030
听好 没有一天
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

379
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,320
 我不想我失去的东西
when I don't think about what I lost.

380
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,030
我失去了最好的朋友
I lost my best friend.

381
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,450
我唯一的朋友
My only friend.

382
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,580
而我明白了 我曾变得贪婪 穷凶极恶 让人失望
And I get it now. I got greedy and desperate and I let you down.

383
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,790
让自己失望
I let myself down.

384
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,460
我唯一想要的是 猫 再给我一次机会
All I'm asking for, Puss, is a second chance.

385
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,840
再给我一次机会 我就能补偿圣里卡多
Give me that second chance and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

386
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,760
求求你 猫
Please, Puss.

387
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,720
让我向你证明 我们的友情对我有多重要
Let me show you what our friendship meant to me.

388
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,270
- 我加入  - 太好了
- I will do it.  - that's great.

389
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,650
我加入 是为了妈妈和圣里卡多 而不是你
I will do this for my mother and for San Ricardo... not for you.

390
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,320
我们不是搭档 也不是朋友
We are not partners and we are not friends.

391
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:59,990
好 我向你保证 不会再让你失望了
OK. I promise this time, I will not let you down.

392
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,330
好!
Yes!

393
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,830
我想我们的魔豆帮重组了
I think we got our Bean Club back.

394
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,560
蛋蛋的计划能成功
Humpty's plan better work.

395
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,730
听好 你只需要关心你的任务 别砸锅了
Listen, you just need to worry about your part. Don't screw it up.

396
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,240
- 怎么?  - 又要戴面具?
- What?  - Again with the mask?

397
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,990
我才不用尘灰靴先生给我造型意见
I don't need style advice from Mr. Dusty Boots.

398
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,330
加油 猫 快!
Come on, Puss. Now!

399
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,210
我们的年级也不小了 亲爱的
Our biological clocks are tickin', darlin'.

400
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,050
- 我们该为未来着想了  - 你怎么搞的?
- You gotta look at the big picture.  - What's your problem?

401
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,470
听好 我一直都有努力保养
Listen. I put a lot of work into my body.

402
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,600
我看起来很好 而我也不会让这些努力付诸东流
I look good, and I am not just gonna throw that away.

403
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,750
- 怎么了?  - 瞧
- What?  - Look.

404
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,400
让我们假装你有一个孩子
Let's just pretend you have a baby.

405
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,400
太完美了
Excellent.

406
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,160
我才没有时间在家里洗尿片和袜子
I don't have time to be at home with no diapers and baby socks.

407
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,990
你大可不必 我可以作住家爸爸
You don't have to, Jill. I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

408
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,580
我们后面就有十只饥饿的小猪
We got ten hungry piggies, there in the back.

409
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,500
你可以先用它们练习 就停车然后喂饱它们
You can practice on them. Just pull over, feed them.

410
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,590
动作快一些
You've got to hurry up.

411
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,340
他是一个可爱的小家伙
He's a cute little bugger.

412
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,550
怎么不用你的爪子?
Why are you not using your claws?

413
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,630
能给我闭嘴吗? 我在弄了
Would you please just shut up! I'm on it!

414
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,300
快用你的爪子!  - 给我安静!
- Just use your claws!  - Be quiet.

415
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,470
你的爪子!  - 我没有爪子 好吗?!
- Your claws!  - I don't have any claws, all right?!

416
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,810
是小猪在叫吗?
Was that Hamhock?

417
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,320
好了好了 小猪乖 快睡觉哈
There, there. Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

418
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,660
照顾小猪
You babysit.

419
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,910
柔爪
- Soft paws.

420
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,620
好没?
Well?

421
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,920
你好 传说中的豆子
Hello, beans of legend.

422
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
我们走
Let's go.

423
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,520
看看谁来了 吉尔
Well, well, well. Look what we have here, Jill.

424
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,310
你敢动我们的宝宝
You messed with our baby.

425
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,650
你还偷了我的魔豆
And you took my beans.

426
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,480
炸弹香肠来了!
Sausage bomb!

427
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,160
你们会付出代价! 坏猫!
You're gonna pay for this! Soul-sucking cats!

428
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,540
给蛋发信号
Signal the egg!

429
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,580
好!
Yes!

430
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,590
- 好了  - 准备
- OK.  - Ready.

431
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,760
- 预备  - 跳!
- Set.  - Go!

432
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,360
哦 天呐!
Oh, my God!

433
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,300
好了 小猫 把豆子给我吧
All right, cat. Give me them beans.

434
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,420
猫真的总是用脚着地吗?
Is it true a cat always lands on its feet?

435
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,390
不! 那只是狗散播的谣言!
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

436
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,760
那就让我们看看
Well, let's find out.

437
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,560
看见了吗? 我说过不会让你失望吧
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

438
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,480
你以为就这样完了?
You think this is over?

439
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,490
差点打中我了!
Hey, that was close!

440
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,880
现在!
Now!

441
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,340
我们一定要撑到桥边! 坐好了!
We just got to make it to that bridge! Hang on!

442
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,260
- 矮蛋 那里没有桥!  - 相信我
- Humpty! There is no bridge!  - Trust me.

443
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,270
矮蛋!
Humpty!

444
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,610
我们死定啦!
We're going to die!

445
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,460
我恨猫
I hate cats.

446
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,250
我们没完!
This is war!

447
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,640
巨人的城堡
Giant's castle...

448
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,810
 我们来了
...here we come.

449
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,810
我得把魔豆交给矮蛋
I must hand it to the egg.

450
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,770
这是团队的成果 矮蛋依然有爪子
This was a team effort. Humpty still has his claws...

451
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,940
我是说连手 这才是我想说的 不是爪子 他也不是猫
I mean, flaws. That was what I meant, not claws. He's not a cat.

452
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,320
- 我没觉得这样有什么问题  - 我不想谈这个
- Not to say there's anything wrong...  - I don't want to talk about it.

453
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,990
明白
Got it.

454
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,870
好了 我们就要到了
OK, we should be close!

455
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,250
留意所有运动不寻常的云
Keep your eyes out for any strange cloud activity!

456
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,170
我被称之为咪・柔爪 是因为我能偷走你的东西
I am called Kitty Softpaws because I'll steal you blind

457
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,550
而你却完全没有察觉
and you'll never even know I was there.

458
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,890
咪?
Kitty?

459
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,180
你和他们说的不一样
You are not as good as they say.

460
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,180
比传说更好
You're better.

461
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,820
我会尊重你的隐私
I will respect your privacy.

462
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,490
好吧 和你说吧
OK. I'll tell you.

463
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,410
那时我只是流浪猫
I was just a stray...

464
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,580
我有很美的爪子
but I had beautiful claws.

465
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,630
有天 一对善良的夫妇收养了我
One day, a really nice couple took me in.

466
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,130
每天早上给我牛奶喝
Gave me milk every morning.

467
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,630
爱着我
Loved me.

468
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,470
或许是我玩地毯玩太过了 或者对仓鼠太不友善
Maybe I scratched their curtains or played too rough with the hamster.

469
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,970
我不知道他们为什么这样
I don't know why they did it.

470
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
他们拔了我的爪子
But they took my claws.

471
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,520
爱猫的人都是疯子
Cat people are crazy.

472
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,320
快停车!我想我们到了
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

473
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,630
你能相信吗 猫?
Can you believe this, Puss?

474
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,550
猫?这么多年之后
After all these years!

475
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,220
来 我想让你来种
Here. I want you to plant them.

476
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,230
这块云的确奇怪
That... is a strange cloud.

477
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,730
好 就是它了! 这都是真的 快来!
OK! This is it! It's happening, hurry!

478
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,240
这边来
This Way!

479
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,030
很好 走快点 走快点
Good, good. Come on, come on, come on.

480
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,660
二十三除以云的厚度
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

481
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,540
停! 就这里!
Hole! Right here.

482
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,420
现在 种下豆子
Now place the beans.

483
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,210
请小心地种下豆子
Place the beans carefully, please.

484
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,170
不要叠在一起 这些魔法很娇弱
Not on top of each other. The magic is very delicate.

485
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:58,510
好了 非常好 现在 我们后退
OK, good. Very good. Now just stand back.

486
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,220
这是怎么回事?
What's happening here?

487
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,310
是不是魔法在你口袋里走光了?
Maybe the magic rubbed off in your pocket?

488
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,640
- 不可能  - 好了 好了 不要恐慌
- That's impossible.  - OK, OK. Let's not panic.

489
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,900
知道吗 我从书上读过 植物也有感觉的
You know, I read somewhere that plants have feelings.

490
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,730
所以...过去对它说些好话
So, come on... say something nice to it.

491
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
好
OK.

492
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,570
让我想一想
Let me just think for a second.

493
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,490
嗨 小豆芽
Hi, little plant.

494
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,160
伙计们
Guys?

495
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,700
矮蛋!
Humpty!

496
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,870
- 我看不到他了 你看到没?  - 我也找不到他
- I do not see him. Do you see him?  - I don't see him anywhere.

497
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,330
你声音好怪
You sound weird.

498
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,330
因为空气稀薄
It's the thin air!

499
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:39,170
快下来 感觉太棒了
Come on in! It feels great!

500
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,470
这些云在挠我的鼻子
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

501
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,060
那是因为这些水气 天晓得呢
That's because they effervesce! Who knew?

502
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,360
来吧
Come on.

503
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,340
抓到了!
Gotcha!

504
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,670
喵...
Meow.

505
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,930
猫 觉得如何? 我该剃胡子吗?
Hey, Puss. What do you think? Do I shave?

506
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,430
来给你看样东西
Let me show you something.

507
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,020
这下面某个地方 有两个孩子
Somewhere down there, there are two little kids,

508
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,320
不知道是不是孤儿呢
I don't know, maybe orphans,

509
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,400
他们躺在草地上看云
and they're laying on a hill, staring at the clouds,

510
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,490
梦想着未来
dreaming about the future.

511
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,160
就是我和你 猫
That was me and you, Puss.

512
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,830
我和你
Me and you.

513
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,960
小子们
Boys!

514
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,840
们应该看看这个
You might want to take a look at this.

515
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,340
巨人的城堡
The giant's castle.

516
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,550
好了 该整装了
OK, time to suit up.

517
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,760
矮蛋!
Humpty!

518
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,430
我会完美地和金蛋混在一起
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs.

519
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,770
很棒吧 嗯?
Brilliant or what, huh?

520
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,530
矮蛋 你没穿内裤
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

521
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,450
怎么? 你感到难为情? 我没有哦
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

522
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,540
猫 还记得别人都笑话魔豆帮吗?
Puss, remember when everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

523
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,580
现在是谁笑得出来? 我们!
And who is laughing now? We are!

524
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,220
哇
Wow!

525
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,650
那就是我们的目标
That is our target.

526
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,860
我们说话不像人妖了
Hey, you don't sound like an elf anymore.

527
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,740
因为这里面的气压正常了
It's because the air pressure in here is normal.

528
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,950
我们走
Let's go.

529
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,620
计划是这样:你们去拿走金蛋 我去找巨人单挑
So here is the plan: You two get the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

530
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,540
没有巨人和你单挑 巨人死了好几年了
There's no giant to fight. The giant's been dead for years.

531
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,960
  - 什么?  - 你不怎么读书 对吧?
- What?!  - You didn't do the reading, did you?

532
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,460
《杰克与魔豆》第14章里 "巨人永远长眠了"
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter 14, "Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

533
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,210
脚跟疼
Ankle burn.

534
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,350
- 那是什么?  - 这就是他们说的"恐怖"
- What was that?  - They call it the Great Terror.

535
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,930
守护黄金之鹅的那只怪物
It's the monster that guards the Golden Goose.

536
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,680
传说中提到过 当你直视它 你就会变成石头
Legend has it that if you look at it, you'll turn to stone.

537
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,310
没有人能证实 是因为没人能活着逃脱它
But nobody really knows because nobody's walked away from it alive.

538
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,400
跟着我 别作声
Follow me and keep quiet.

539
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,740
嘘!矮蛋!
Shh! Humpty!

540
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,870
我忍不住啊 我全身都粘粘痒痒的
I can't help it. Everything's rubbing and pinching!

541
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,660
 我得用爽身粉
I need powder!

542
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,100
我们要怎么过去?
How are we gonna get across?

543
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,350
开香槟
Champagne.

544
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,310
干杯!
Cheers!

545
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,580
别害怕哦 我会保护你
Do not worry. I will protect you.

546
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:45,080
你要怎么做? 用吉他敲它的头?
What are you gonna do? Hit it in the head with a guitar?

547
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,420
拜托 别再提吉他的事
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

548
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,230
接住我!
Catch me!

549
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,610
快!
Hurry!

550
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,110
躲!
Hide!

551
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,990
别看它!
Don't look at it!

552
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,460
矮蛋 闭嘴!
Humpty! Be quiet!

553
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,380
我说我不能呼吸 你还堵住我的嘴！
I said I couldn't breathe and then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

554
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,550
你得振作起来 加油!
You gotta get it together. Come on!

555
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,880
好
OK.

556
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,820
看看啊 就像蛋蛋天堂
Look at this. It's egg paradise.

557
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,110
这儿太美了 我觉得我就属于这里
It's so beautiful, I feel like I belong here.

558
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,370
金蛋!
Golden eggs.

559
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,210
尽你所能享受吧
Grab as many as you can.

560
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,880
我还以为它们和鸡蛋一样大
I thought they were going to be like chicken size.

561
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,300
你能想象它怎么下金蛋的吗? 矮油
Can you imagine laying one of these? Ouch!

562
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,890
猫!
Puss!

563
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,430
我们要怎么把蛋弄出去?
How are we supposed to get these out of here?

564
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,890
我也不知道
I don't know.

565
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,230
我的天啊
Oh, my!

566
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,240
黄金之鹅
The Golden Goose.

567
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,570
看看她啊 她不美吗?
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

568
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,670
我亲爱的宝贝
My sweet darling.

569
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,340
我觉得她喜欢你
I think she likes you.

570
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,720
我们就带走她吧
Let's just take her.

571
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,600
等等 这可是传说中的鹅啊
Wait a minute. This is the goose of legend.

572
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,520
我们不知道带走她会有什么后果
We don't know what happens if we take her.

573
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,980
我知道不带走她会有什么后果 我们啥也没捞着
I know what happens if we don't take her, we got nothing.

574
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,400
大家伙 她能下金子啊 我们要带走她
Guys, guys. It's a gold peeper. We're taking it!

575
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,120
就快到了
Almost there!

576
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,160
抓稳!
Hang on!

577
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,210
坚持一下!
Hang on!

578
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,690
它来了!
It's coming!

579
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,320
跑!
Run!

580
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,340
咪!
Kitty!

581
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,220
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

582
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,280
抓稳!
Hang on!

583
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,040
给我过来!
Come here, you.

584
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,960
抓到你了!
Got you!

585
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,880
她是我的了
She's mine now!

586
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,060
你好
Hello!

587
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,820
不!飞啊 小鹅 飞啊!
Oh, no! Fly, little gosling, fly!

588
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,160
不! 不应该是这个样子的!
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

589
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,830
- 猫?  - 不是
- Puss?  - No.

590
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,130
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

591
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,480
谢谢 威猛先生
Thanks, Ginger.

592
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,110
我们应该砍了那豆芽
We should maybe cut that down.

593
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:13,330
看啊 你终于有了想要的家庭了 杰克
Look at that. You finally got that family you wanted, Jack.

594
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,370
听到了吗? 我想他刚才叫我"爸爸"了
Did you hear that? I think he just called me Daddy.

595
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,880
- 他看起来很像你 杰克  - 谢谢
- He looks just like you, Jack.  - Thank you.

596
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,680
矮蛋


597
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,140
那是什么?
Well, what is it?

598
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,740
我相信这是给我们的信号
I do believe that's our cue.

599
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,700
为了报答圣里卡多!
To paying back San Ricardo!

600
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,450
为了富有
To being rich!

601
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,750
棒极了
iOle?

602
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,510
你
You.

603
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:13,970
我?
Me?

604
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,680
嗯嗯 宝贝
Yeah, yeah, baby!

605
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,150
一 二 恰恰恰
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

606
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,310
三 四 恰恰恰
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!

607
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,270
一 二... 什么?!
One, two... What?!

608
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,820
我只有一个字对你说 咪・柔爪 喵...
There is one word for you, Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

609
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:34,910
我知道你很有女人缘 超级猛猫先生
I know you have quite a reputation with the ladies, Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

610
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,250
我同时也被称为 毛毛爱人
I've also been known as the... Furry Lover!

611
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,420
但那都是认识你之前的事了
But that was before I met you.

612
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:47,590
但你不认识我 猫 我不是你想象中的那样
You don't know me, Puss. I'm not who you think I am. I'm all about the score.

613
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,840
来吧 看着我的眼睛 告诉我你只在乎那些金子
Come on. Look me in the eyes and tell me all you care about is the gold.

614
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,350
- 猫...  - 咪...
- Puss...  - Kitty...

615
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,520
哦 天啊!
Oh, my God!

616
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,900
交换舞伴
New partners!

617
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,570
不要被他的公猫魅力迷惑 要专注
Do not fall for his animal magnetism. You stay focused.

618
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,240
什么?!
What?!

619
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,620
我一直在想 柔爪小姐
So... I have been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

620
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:26,250
如果我们要分开走的话 那我们就能一起分开走了
that when we go our separate ways, we can go our separate ways...together.

621
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,510
猫 你必须要走了
Puss, you have to go, now.

622
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:34,340
你不必再抗拒我了 请相信我
You do not have to push me away any more. You can trust me

623
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:39,810
为圣里卡多的传奇喝彩吧 矮蛋和猫 我们成功了
Give it up for the legends of San Ricardo, Humpty and Puss! We did it!

624
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,310
- 我先去睡了 大家伙  - 咪 一起庆祝吧
- I'm calling it a night, guys.  - Kitty! Stay up with us.

625
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,320
不了 我感觉...要吐毛球了
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

626
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,320
好吧 吐得开心点
OK, yeah. Have fun with that!

627
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,030
我们该给她一点私人空间
We should give her some privacy.

628
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,080
我从没想到我们能走到这一步
I never thought we would get to here.

629
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,000
在经历过这些事之后 能把它们都抛诸脑后
After all we went through to pull this off, together.

630
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,670
和好兄弟重聚的感觉真好
It is good to have my brother back.

631
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,220
是啊 的确是
Yep. Sure is.

632
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,050
明天可有好戏上演
Well, we have a big day tomorrow.

633
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,060
多让人兴奋啊
Pretty exciting stuff.

634
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,890
我们该休息了
We should get some rest.

635
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,400
晚安 矮蛋
Good night, Humpty.

636
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,150
我还没死
I am still alive!

637
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,440
杰克和吉尔
Jack and Jill.

638
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,110
咪?
Kitty?

639
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,450
矮蛋?
Humpty?

640
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,950
我会找到你们的
I will find you.

641
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,960
快给我滚!
Get out of here!

642
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,270
圣里卡多


643
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,200
通缉:穿靴子的猫 赏钱500


644
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,430
走开!
Be gone!

645
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,480
你想要什么? 金子吗? 我有金子啊
What do you want? Gold? I have gold!

646
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,480
杰克 蛋蛋想收买我们呢
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

647
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:33,980
用我们的金子吗
With our own gold.

648
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,400
好了 我们只想吃早餐而已
Come on now, all we want is a little breakfast.

649
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,400
- 不要!求求你!  - 你喜欢你的蛋吗 矮蛋?
- No, no, please!  - How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

650
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,240
矮蛋 不!
Humpty, no!

651
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,080
好啊 猫
Hello, Puss.

652
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,080
惊喜哦!
Surprise!

653
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,130
这怎么回事?
What is going on?

654
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,220
这是个惊喜派对啊 而惊喜是给你的
It's a surprise party, and the surprise is on you.

655
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,970
看起来猫猫刚起床呢
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

656
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,680
你们是一伙的?!
You were in cahoots?!

657
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,140
是啊 他们都为我卖命
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

658
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:13,520
我在监狱里为了今天准备了很久
I spent a lot of time in prison preparing for this.

659
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,400
- 你算计我  - 对啊 我算计你了 必须的
- You set me up.  - Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

660
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,900
你以为这就是拿回金子 然后挽回你的名声?
You think this was all about getting the gold and clearing your name?

661
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:25,410
这次的冒险只有一个目的
This little adventure was about one thing.

662
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,910
复仇!
Revenge.

663
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,830
你根本不知道 猫 我一直在你身边
You never knew it, Puss... but I was always there.

664
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:59,030
你想要补偿过去的过失吗 猫? 我也想
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss? Well, so did I.

665
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,570
那你为什么这么做?
Why would you do this?

666
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,150
你把我抛弃在了桥上!
You left me on that bridge!

667
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,450
你在我最需要你的时候抛弃了我
You abandoned me when I needed you the most.

668
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,160
- 你忘了"永是兄弟"了?!  - 你欺骗了我!
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!  - I trusted you!

669
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,370
那你终于明白我的感受了
Well, now you're finally gonna know what it feels like,

670
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,330
就是 当你信赖一个人 他却在你背后插刀
you know, to trust someone and have them stab you in the back.

671
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,290
卫兵!
Guards!

672
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,250
穿靴子的猫 你因打劫圣里卡多银行的罪名而被捕
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

673
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,420
把这当成魔豆帮的最后一次聚头吧
Consider this the final meeting of Bean Club.

674
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,470
我应该把你煎了拌着洋葱吃!
I should scramble you with onions!

675
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,220
你不应该回来这里
You should never have come back.

676
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:31,350
我的孩子! 等等
iPequeno! Wait.

677
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,640
别和他们打 求你了
Do not fight them, please.

678
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,610
妈妈 听我说 我能解释
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

679
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:41,150
不 猫 别再逃跑了
No. Puss, no more running.

680
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,490
请不要再让我伤心了 面对你做过的一切吧
Please stop breaking my heart and face what you have done.

681
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,160
对不起 妈妈
I'm sorry, Mama.

682
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,660
我让你失望了
I let you down.

683
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,920
把爪子举起来
Paws where we can see them!

684
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,090
转过身 慢慢地
Turn around... slow.

685
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,760
再慢点!
Slower!

686
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,520
走进笼子里 走得安静漂亮些
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

687
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:26,280
注意了!注意了! 请大家尽量走近一些
Attention! Attention, everyone! If you could just come in a little closer.

688
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:32,040
女士们先生们 我为您呈现――传说中的黄金之鹅
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... the Golden Goose of legend!

689
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,580

Kitty. Not you, too?

690
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,930
大家都有金子!
Gold for everyone!

691
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:52,100
我们有新鲜热辣的金子啦 乡亲们!
We got some fresh, hot gold here, people!

692
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,600
都来拿啊! 要趁热啊!
Step right up! Get it hot!

693
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,360
帽子一顶
One hat.

694
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,700
腰带一条
One belt.

695
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,030
还有一双鞋
And two boots...

696
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,040
曾经 荣耀的象征
...once a symbol of honor.

697
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,330
还有一瓶蒙汗药?
One bottle of catnip?

698
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,130
给我的青光眼用的
It is for my glaucoma.

699
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,220
这就是你该呆的地方 法外之徒
This is where you belong, outlaw.

700
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:34,720
这就是你度过下半辈子的地方
And this is where you will stay... forever.

701
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,240
别因为我停下来哦
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

702
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:11,720
看来那颗蛋得到了他想要的东西
Well, it looks like the egg got what he wanted.

703
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,720
你是在说矮蛋吗?
You're talking about Humpty?

704
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:19,180
别提他的名字 以前那坏蛋和我一起在这个牢房里
Don't say his name! I used to share this cell with that smelly thing.

705
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,310
他离开那天是我人生最快乐的日子
Happiest day of my life was when he left.

706
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,190
直到我发现他偷走了我的魔豆
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

707
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,490
停停停 你曾拥有魔豆? 你是谁?
Wait, wait, wait! You had the beans? Who are you?

708
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,070
你叫什么名字?
Hey! What's your name?

709
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,070
安迪・豆茎
Andy Beanstalk!

710
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,080
友们都叫我杰克
My friends call me Jack.

711
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,580
我用家里的牛换了那些魔豆
I traded the family cow for them beans.

712
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,660
当然 那不是我家的牛
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

713
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:44,750
是人家家里的牛 所以我被判了八到十年
It was some other family's family cow. That's why I got eight to ten.

714
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,920
一定要认清楚自己的牛啊
Always know which cow is yours.

715
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,050
老疯子 醒醒!
Crazy man. Wake up!

716
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,220
你还知道什么?
What else do you know?

717
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,100
我们都完了 多亏了那坏蛋
We're all goners, thanks to that little stinky!

718
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:03,520
我说过不要带走那只鹅 但他一心只想要报仇
I told him not to take the goose, but all he wanted was his revenge!

719
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,020
别带走鹅 为什么?
Don't take the goose. Why?

720
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,410
那个"恐怖" 是黄金之鹅的妈妈
The Great Terror! That's the Golden Goose's mama.

721
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,860
哦 不
Oh, no.

722
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,700
当她回来找寻孩子的时候
And she will be out for blood

723
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,410
 就会带来血雨腥风
when she comes back for her baby.

724
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,210
守卫! 圣里卡多灾难临头啦! 你一定要听我说!
Guard! San Ricardo is in terrible danger! You must listen to me!

725
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,710
闭嘴!
Quiet, you!

726
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,070
闭嘴!
Shut up.

727
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,760
把门打开
Open the door.

728
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,020
放下武器
Drop the weapon.

729
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,140
很好
Very good.

730
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:27,480
站一边去
Step aside.

731
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,650
不
No.

732
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,610
恶魔之猫!
Diablo Gato!

733
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,780
有一套嘛
Nice try.

734
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,500
希望你能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

735
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,460
道歉接受!
Apology accepted!

736
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,550
我才没有时间理你
I don't really have time for you.

737
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,800
我要保护镇子不被"恐怖"毁了
I have to save the town from the Great Terror!

738
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,800
等等 猫
Wait, Puss!

739
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,890
 你不明白吗? 我来这里是因为...
Don't you see? I'm here because...

740
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,640
我来这里是因为你让我明白
I am here because you made me realize

741
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:07,890
我心里有比金子还重要的东西
that there is something I care about more than gold.

742
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,610
东西?
Something?

743
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:13,650
好啦 某猫
OK. Someone.

744
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:16,690
他大概两尺高 穿高跟鞋
He's about two feet tall, wears high heels.

745
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,320
他帅不?
Handsome?

746
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,450
他超级的帅
He's very handsome.

747
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,870
是只猛猫吗?
A real beefcake?

748
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,990
- 骏马?  - 是的
- A stallion?  - Yes.

749
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,040
- 猛虎?  - 大哥...
- Tiger?  - Oh, brother.

750
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,620
但是 这并不代表我们扯平了
But this does not make us even.

751
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,790
别动!
Freeze!

752
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,420
不 扯平了
Yes, it does.

753
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,250
不不不 没扯平
No, no, no, it doesn't.

754
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,590
我救过你
I saved you!

755
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,180
你欠我一次
You owed me one.

756
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,760
你没告诉我矮蛋的计划
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

757
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,520
所以你欠我两次了
So now you owe me two.

758
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:55,780
- 你真是难对付  - 对啊 但我值得嘛
- You're a lot of work.  - I know. But I am worth it!

759
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,820
你跑不掉的 穿靴子的猫!
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

760
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,990
烂靴子
Wrong boots.

761
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,080
咪!
Kitty!

762
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,910
现在扯平了!
Now we're even!

763
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:19,920
这里是圣里卡多天气预报
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

764
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,680
一只巨鹅毁掉这镇子的几率是...
Chances of a giant goose destroying the town...

765
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,930
百分之百
...one hundred percent.

766
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:32,650
永不落单 团结一致
Never alone, always together...

767
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,150
矮蛋和猫...
Humpty and Puss...

768
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,070
永是兄弟
Brothers forever.

769
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:43,950
来吧 宝贝 在妈妈来之前离开这里吧
Come on, sweetie. Let's, uh, get out of here before Mama shows up.

770
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,910
我该煎了你做鸡蛋沙拉三明治!
I should make you into an egg salad sandwich!

771
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,540
这太恶心了!
That is disgusting!

772
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,210
给我金鹅 矮蛋
Give me the goose, Humpty.

773
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,290
这恐怕做不到
No can do, I'm afraid.

774
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,460
看 她妈妈就要来了 而当她来了之后...
See, the mama's on her way, and when she gets here,

775
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,960
圣里卡多和你在乎的一切都要拜拜了
it's bye-bye San Ricardo and everything you ever cared about!

776
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:03,970
对我复仇是一回事 那伊梅尔达呢? 孤儿院呢?
Revenge on me is one thing, but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

777
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,680
那是我们的家啊
This is our home.

778
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,220
你是说你家
You mean your home.

779
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,980
我根本不属于这里
I never belonged here.

780
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,480
我们本来计划好逃走的
We had a plan to get out of here,

781
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,820
但突然间英雄出现了 然后选择了这里而抛弃了我
but then you became a hero and you picked this place over me.

782
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,990
你带走了我的一切
You left me with nothing.

783
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:28,660
矮蛋 很抱歉我伤害了你
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

784
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:35,080
但不要牵连这里的人 你不是这样的人!
But do not take it out on these people. You are better than this!

785
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,630
- 不 我是的  - 哦 拜托 !
- No, I'm not.  - Oh, come on!

786
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,510
我认识真正的矮蛋
I know the real Humpty.

787
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:44,800
那不平凡的眼光 那位发明家 那位梦想家
The way you saw the world! The inventor! The dreamer!

788
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,260
那个人怎么了?
What happened to that guy?

789
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,100
我...我想已经太晚了
I... I think it's too late.

790
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,770
做正确的事情永远不晚
It is never too late to do the right thing.

791
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,020
我们在一起 能拯救圣里卡多
Together we can save San Ricardo!

792
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,410
我这就原谅你 矮蛋 只要你帮我一把
I can forgive you, Humpty... if you help me now.

793
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,700
真的?
Really?

794
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,250
在我对你做过这么多事情之后?
After everything I put you through?

795
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,210
这就证明给我看 你有颗闪亮的心
Prove to me there is still a good egg in you.

796

我会努力的
I'll try.

眼镜好了
Goggles, check.

798

把小鹅带到桥那里 我会把妈妈带过去

抱歉 蛋头 我们想要的不止金蛋
Sorry, egghead, we want more than just eggs.

813
