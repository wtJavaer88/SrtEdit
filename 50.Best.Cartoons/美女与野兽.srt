1
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:20,875
从前
Once upon a time 

2
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,915
在一个遥远地方
in a faraway land

3
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:26,851
一个年轻的王子住在美丽的城堡里
a young prince lived in a shining castle.

4
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,048
虽然他拥有了一切他想要的东西
Although he had everything his heart desired

5
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,092
但这个王子却被宠坏了
the prince was spoiled, 

6
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,026
非常自私 暴躁，
selfish and unkind.

7
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,060
在冬天的一个夜晚
But then, one winter's night

8
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,794
城堡前来了一个乞讨的老太婆
an old beggar woman came to the castle

9
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,769
想要用她一朵玫瑰花
and offered him a single rose

10
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:47,205
去跟这个王子换得一个能身的地方
in return for shelter from the bitter cold.

11
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:52,302
王子不屑于衣衫褴褛妇人的玫瑰
Repulsed by her haggard appearance the prince sneered at the gift

12
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,677
并且残忍地把她赶走
and turned the old woman away

13
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:59,276
这个老太婆警告王子不要只看外表
but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances for beauty

14
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,412
内在才是最美丽的根本
is found within

15
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,389
王子不理会，凶狠地赶她离开
and when he dismissed her again

16
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,324
突然这个丑陋的老太婆
the old woman's ugliness melted away

17
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:10,329
变成了一个非常美丽的女人
to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

18
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,297
王子赶忙向她道歉
The prince tried to apologize,

19
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,525
但是已经太迟了
but it was too late

20
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,230
因为她发现王子没有一点爱心
for she had seen that there was no love in his heart

21
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,293
为了惩罚他
and as punishment,

22
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,170
她把王子变成了野兽
she transformed him into a hideous beast

23
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,938
并且对整个城堡
and placed a powerful spell on the castle

24
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,411
以及里面的人发下了咒语
and all who lived there.

25
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,413
巨大而恐怖的野兽羞于他的外表
Ashamed of his monstrous form

26
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,452
而终日把自己锁在城堡里
the Beast concealed himself inside his castle

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,919
只有一个魔镜
with a magic mirror 

28
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,855
可以看见外界的情形
as his only window to the outside world.

29
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,416
那女人留下的玫瑰
The rose she had offered

30
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,122
变成有魔咒的花
was truly an enchanted rose

31
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,688
将在王子21岁时绽放
which would bloom until his 21st year.

32
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,395
如果在最后一片花瓣掉落之前
If he could learn to love another

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,806
王子能够学会了爱人 而且也有人爱他
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

34
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,969
那所有的咒语就会解除
then the spell would be broken.

35
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,376
否则…
If not, 

36
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:04,349
他终身都会是一头野兽了
he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,517
时间一天天的过去了
As the years passed,

38
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:13,150
他陷入了失望与绝望之中
he fell into despair and lost all hope

39
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,718
因为有谁会去爱上一只野兽呢
for who could ever learn to love a beast?

40
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:48,760
小城镇，是个安静的村
Little town,it's a quiet village

41
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,664
每一天都和以前一样
Ev'ry day like the one before

42
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,262
小城中都是小人物
Little town full of little people

43
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:03,675
醒来就说
waking up to say

44
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,472
你好…（法语）
Bon jour!

45
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,103
你好…
Bon jour!

46
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,442
你看那面包师父叫卖着
There goes the baker With his tray like always

47
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:14,886
一成不变的面包卷
The same old bread and rolls to sell

48
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,684
每个早晨都是一样
Every morning just the same

49
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,249
自从我们到这偏僻的小镇
Since the morning that we came To this poor provincial town...

50
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,294
早安啊，贝儿
Good morning, Belle.

51
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,226
早安，先生
Good morning, Monsieur.

52
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,126
到那儿去啊？
Where are you off to?

53
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,992
去书店
The bookshop.

54
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,396
我刚看完了一本很棒的故事书
I just finished the most wonderful story

55
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,024
是关于杰克豆子  而我现在正要…
about a beanstalk and an ogre, and...

56
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:32,334
很好，玛P拿面包，快去
That's nice. Marie! The baguettes. Hurry up!

57
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,840
快看那走过来的奇怪女孩
Look, there she goes The girl is strange, no question

58
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,307
她茫然迷惑的眼神
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

59
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,244
从不跟人打交道
Never part of any crowd

60
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,010
脑袋充满着幻想
'Cause her head's up on some cloud

61
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,315
可笑女孩贝儿
No denying she's a funny girl, that Belle

62
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,320
你好
Bonjour

63
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,287

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,855
你夫人怎么样
How is your wife?

68
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,758
我要六个蛋
I need six eggs

69
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,262
那太贵了
That's too expensive

70
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,597
人们的生活不该是这样
There must be more than this provincial life...

71
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,400
贝儿
Ah, Belle.

72
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,163
早上好
Good morning.

73
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,728
我把书拿来还给你
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

74
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,000
你都看完了？
Finished already?

75
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,302
我爱不释手
Oh, I couldn't put it down.

76
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,400
你有新的书吗？
Have you got anything new?

77
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,537
哪儿有那么快
Not since yesterday.

78
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,012
没关系，我就借…这本
That's all right. I'll borrow... this one.

79
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,550
这本？你已经看过两遍了
That one? But you've read it twice.

80
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,811
我最喜欢这本
Well, it's my favorite...

81
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,218
有远方的城堡，刺激的打斗
far-off places, daring sword fights

82
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,290
还有魔咒跟白马王子
magic spells, a prince in disguise.

83
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,019
既然你那么喜欢就送给你
If you like it all that much, it's yours.

84
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,053
可是，先生…
- But, sir...

85
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,289
-我坚持 -那…谢谢你
- I insist. Well, thank you.

86
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,990
谢谢你
Thank you very much.

87
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,859
看，这与众不同的女孩
Look, there she goes That girl is so peculiar

88
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,200
她心中是否快乐
I wonder if she's feeling well

89
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,136
一头栽进书堆中
With a dreamy, far-off look

90
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,697
整天做白日梦
And her nose stuck in a book

91
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,806
一个令人迷惑的美丽女孩贝儿
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,076
这是多么美妙
Oh, isn't this amazing?

93
00:05:53,153 --> 00:06:02,323
这是我最喜欢的部分 因为你看…
It's my favorite part because you'll see

94
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:08,493
因为她在这里 遇见了迷人的王子
Here's where she meets Prince Charming

95
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,697
她都没有认出他
But she won't discover that it's him

96
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,230
直到在第三章之前
Till Chapter Three

97
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,471
难怪每人都叫她美女贝儿
Now, it's no wonder that her name means beauty

98
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,915
她的外表无人可比
Her looks have got no parallel

99
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,747
不过虽然拥有美貌
But behind that fair facade

100
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,617
但她个性古怪又孤僻
I'm afraid she's rather odd 

101
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,518
与众不同
Very different from the rest of us

102
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:36,357
那与众不同古怪女孩贝儿
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle

103
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,202
加斯顿，你真是百发百中
Wow, you didn't miss a shot, Gaston.

104
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,999
你是世界上最棒的猎人
You're the greatest hunter in the whole world.

105
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,834
我知道
I know.

106
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,067
没有一只野兽可从你手上逃走
No beast alive stands a chance against you

107
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,140
女人也一样
and no girl, for that matter.

108
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,203
这是实话 而且我的目标就是她
It's true, Lefou, and I've got my sights set on that one.

109
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,339
那个发明家的女儿？
The inventor's daughter?

110
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,313
就是她
She's the one... 

111
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,180
我要娶的幸运女孩
the lucky girl I'm going to marry.

112
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,220
但是她… 全城最美的女孩
But, she... The most beautiful girl in town.

113
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:01,980
我知道，可是…
I know, but... 

114
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,156
她是最美的
That makes her the best

115
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:04,625
难道我不够资格要最美的吗？
and don't I deserve the best?

116
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,456
难道我不够资格要最美的吗？
and don't I deserve the best?

117
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,460
当然够资格，可是…
Well, of course. I mean, you do, but...

118
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,965
当我第一眼看到美女贝儿
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her

119
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:12,363
当我第一眼看到美女贝儿
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her

120
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,731
她美丽外表吸引我
I said, "She's gorgeous," and I fell

121
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,803
在这小城只有她
Here in town there's only she

122
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,701
是我理想的对象
who is beautiful as me

123
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,731
我会让她成为我的新娘
So, I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

124
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,474
快看，是他，向我们走来
Look, there he goes, isn't he dreamy?

125
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,914
英俊，潇洒，令人着迷
Monsieur Gaston, oh, he's so cute

126
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,549
心跳，加快，我不能呼吸
Be still, my heart, I'm hardly breathing

127
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,590
他高大强壮，掳获我的心
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute

128
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,558
-你好 -早安
- Bonjour -Pardon - Good day -Mais oui

129
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,389
-这也叫做鱼？ -葡萄真新鲜
- You call this bacon? - What lovely grapes

130
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,587
-起司一磅 -十码
- Ten yards -Some cheese- 'Scuse me -One pound

131
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,789
-借过 -我帮你切
I'll get the knife 

132
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,762
请让我过
Please let me through

133
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,993
-面包硬了 -鱼不新鲜
- This bread -Those fish - It's stale -They smell

134
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,227
这是个误会
Madame's mistaken

135
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,066
人们的生活不该就这样
There must be more Than this provincial life

136
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:57,233
我要让贝儿成为我新娘
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife

137
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,574
你看那与众不同美女贝儿
Look, there she goes A girl who's strange but special

138
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,910
她是最奇怪的小姐
A most peculiar mademoiselle

139
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,881
那真是太可惜了
It's a pity and a sin

140
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,418
那和她不像
She doesn't quite fit in

141
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,578
因为她是位有趣的女孩
'Cause she really is a funny girl

142
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:15,821
她美丽且有趣的…
A beauty but a funny girl. She really is a funny girl

143
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,960
-贝儿 -你好…
That Belle... Bonjour, 

144
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,431
你好…
bonjour.

145
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,668
贝儿
Hello, Belle.

146
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,729
你好，加斯顿
Bonjour, Gaston.

147
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,808
请把书还给我好吗？加斯顿
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

148
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,376
你怎么能看这种书？
How can you read this?

149
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:33,308
又没有图片
There's no pictures.

150
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,812
有些人看书是全靠想像的
Well, some people use their imagination.

151
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,543
贝儿，你不该成天钻在书堆里
Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books

152
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,278
而是应该注意一些重要的事情
and paid attention to more important things...

153
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,647
比如说…像我
like me.

154
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,787
全城的人都在议论你
The whole town's talking about it.

155
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,587
女人不应该看太多的书
It's not right for a woman to read.

156
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,594
要不然她就会有意见
Soon she starts getting ideas,

157
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:51,390
有思想了
and thinking...

158
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,795
加斯顿，没想到你的思想这么保守
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

159
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,833
谢谢，贝儿
Why, thank you, Belle.

160
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,461
不要再看书了，我们边走边谈
What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern

161
00:08:58,536 --> 00:08:59,560
走，去看看我的战利品
and take a look at my trophies?

162
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,162
改天再说好了
Maybe some other time.

163
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:01,933
她怎么了？
What's wrong with her?

164
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,269
她疯啦？
She's crazy.

165
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,831
他真帅
He's gorgeous.

166
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,274
抱歉，加斯顿，我没空
Please, Gaston, I can't.

167
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,505
我要回去帮我父亲的忙
I have to get home to help my father.

168
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,443
再见
Good-bye.

169
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:11,479
那个老家伙
That crazy old loon...

170
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,642
我看他神经有问题哦
he needs all the help he can get.

171
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,784
不准那样说我父亲
Don't talk about my father that way.

172
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:16,254
对，不准你那样说她父亲
Yeah, don't talk about her father that way.

173
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,313
对，不准你那样说她父亲
Yeah, don't talk about her father that way.

174
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:20,014
我父亲他好得很
My father is not crazy.

175
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,318
他是个天才
He's a genius.

176
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:35,935
爸爸…
Ooh! Papa?

177
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:38,305
怎么会这样呢，真差劲
How on earth did that happen? Doggone it!

178
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,071
没事吧？爸爸…
Are you all right, Papa?

179
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,014
我决定要放弃这个废物了
I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.

180
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,245
你每次都是这么说
You always say that.

181
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,547
我这次是真的决定了
I mean it this time.

182
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,419
我再也不碰这个东西了
I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work!

183
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,479
要碰
Yes, you will

184
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,958
而且你还会在发明展上得到第一
and you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow.

185
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,928
成为一个最伟大的发明家哦
Humph! And become a world-famous inventor.

186
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,091
你真的相信吗？
You really believe that?

187
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,767
我当然相信
I always have.

188
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,970
那还等什么？
Well, what are we waiting for?

189
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:08,232
我现在就修理
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

190
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,705
女儿，对了
Hand me that, uh...

191
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,536
帮我把工具拿来
dog-legged clincher, there.

192
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,510
城里好不好玩啊？
So, did you have a good time in town today?

193
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,103
我又多了一本书了
I got a new book.

194
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,908
爸爸，你觉得我很怪吗？
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

195
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:22,110
我的女儿很怪？
My daughter? Odd?

196
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,150
你怎么会有这种想法？
Where would you get an idea like that?

197
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:25,687
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

198
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,656
我总觉得这里不适合我
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

199
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:30,659
没有一个人可以跟我说得上话
There's no one I can really talk to.

200
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,690
那加斯顿呢？
What about that Gaston?

201
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,230
加斯顿长得很英俊哪
He's a handsome fellow.

202
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,559
他长得是不错
He's handsome, all right,

203
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,827
可是他又粗俗，又自大
and rude, and conceited, and...

204
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,994
爸爸，他不适合我
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

205
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:43,266
别急，这个新发明
Well, don't you worry 'cause this invention's

206
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,900
会带给我们新的生活
going to be the start of a new life for us.

207
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:49,002
大概可以了，试一下吧
I think that's done it. Now, let's give it a try.

208
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,722
成功了
It works!

209
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,261
真的吗？
It does?

210
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,828
-真的 -成功了
It does! You did it!

211
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:10,932
你成功了
You really did it!

212
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:12,296
把费力准备好
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

213
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,302
我要去展览会了
I'm off to the fair!

214
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:18,370
再见，爸爸，祝你好运
Good-bye, Papa. Good luck.

215
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:19,409
再见，贝儿
Good-bye, Belle,

216
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,842
在家小心点喔
and take care while I'm gone.

217
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:40,898
我们应该到了才对呀？
We should be there by now.

218
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:41,728
我们应该到了才对呀？
We should be there by now.

219
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:44,130
是不是转错弯了？
Maybe we've missed the turn.

220
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:46,566
我想我们应该走…这边
I guess I should have taken...

221
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:47,501
等一等…
Wait a minute.

222
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,901
应该走这边
Let's go this way.

223
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:05,282
走啊
Come on, Philippe,

224
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:09,314
这是捷径，我们马上就到了
it's a shortcut. We'll be there in no time.

225
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,772
是不大对啊
This can't be right.

226
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:34,112
我看我们还是往回头走吧
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We'd better turn around.

227
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,610
天啊
Whoa... Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe. Oh!

228
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,127
小心，走
Oh, look out!

229
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:44,616
小心，走
Oh, look out!

230
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:50,957
老天
Whoa, boy!

231
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,369
退后…
Back up, back up, back up!

232
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:59,129
乖孩子…
Good boy, good boy. That's it. Back up!

233
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,401
稳住…
Steady, steady.

234
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:03,444
站稳了，站稳了
Now, steady.

235
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,945
费力…
Philippe, no!

236
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,143
费力…
Philippe.

237
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:42,475
救命啊，有人在吗？
Oh... Help! Is someone there?!

238
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,208
救命
Oh! Help!

239
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:53,061
走开，走开啊
Oh...

240
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,359
他一定是在森林里迷了路
Poor fellow, must have lost his way in the woods.

241
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,263
别吵，他也许会离开的
Keep quiet; maybe he'll go away.

242
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,491
有人在吗？
Is someone there?

243
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:37,397
不许出声，卢米亚 不准发出任何声音
Not a word, Lumiere; not one word.

244
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,667
我不是有意要闯进来的
I don't mean to intrude, 

245
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:42,267
我的马跑了
but I've lost my horse

246
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:45,040
我想借住一个晚上
and I need a place to stay for the night.

247
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:47,479
葛士华，有点良心好不好
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart. Shh!

248
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,078
没问题，我们非常欢迎
Of course, Monsieur, you are welcome here.

249
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:54,314
谁在说话？
Who said that?

250
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,682
是我
Over here.

251
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,952
在哪里啊？
Where?

252
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:58,886
你好
Allo.

253
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,097
不可思议…
Incredible.

254
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,099
慢点，慢点
Well, now you've done it,

255
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,932
卢米亚，你看你做的好事
Lumiere. Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

256
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,596
这是怎么做成的
How is this accomplished?

257
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,570
住手，你放我下来
Put me down at once! Stop that!

258
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:15,041
我叫你放我下来
Stop that, I say. Ow!

259
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,641
先生，如果你不介意的话
Huh... Close that at once.

260
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,083
请你把门关上好吗？
Do you mind?!

261
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:26,416
真是对不起
I-I beg your pardon.

262
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:30,255
实在是因为我…从来没有看过钟会… 
It's, it's just that I've never seen a...

263
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,293
先生，你全身都湿透了
Oh, you are soaked to the bone, Monsieur.

264
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,467
来吧，到里面生个火取取暖吧
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

265
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:43,629
谢谢
Thank you.

266
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,139
不行，不行…
No, no, no.

267
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,073
如果让主人发现他在这里
You know what the master will do if he finds him here.

268
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:51,146
我命令你们俩个站住
I demand that you stop right there.

269
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,149
不可以坐在主人的椅子
Oh, no, no! Not the master's chair.

270
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,083
不可以坐在主人的椅子
Oh, no, no! Not the master's chair.

271
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,648
我没看见
I'm not seeing this!

272
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,188
我什么都没看见
I am not seeing this!

273
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,120
你好吗？
Well, hello there, boy.

274
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:11,458
真舒服  够了，这太过份了
What service. All right, this has gone far enough.

275
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,661
我是这里的总管
I'm in charge here.

276
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,135
还是先喝杯热茶吧，先生
How would you like a nice spot of tea, sir?

277
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:17,638
你马上就会感觉暖和的
Lt'll warm you up in no time.

278
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:20,937
不要茶，不要茶
No. No tea. No tea!

279
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:26,306
妈妈，他的胡子好痒哦
His mustache tickles, Mama. Oh!

280
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:28,907
你好
Hello. Uh-oh. Oh... Ah...

281
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,125
这里有个陌生人
There's a stranger here.

282
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:47,827
主人请听我解释
Master, allow me to explain.

283
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,598
他在森林里迷路了
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

284
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,435
又湿又冷…
He was cold and wet...

285
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:57,336
主人，请你听我说
Master, I'd like to take this moment to say

286
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,808
我是完全反对呀
I was against this from the start.

287
00:16:58,881 --> 00:16:59,609
都是他们
It was all his fault.

288
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:01,172
我曾经劝过他们
I tried to stop them, but would they listen to me? No.

289
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:10,216
你是谁？为什么到这里来？
Who are you? What are you doing here?

290
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:12,726
我迷了路，而且我…
I-I-I was lost in the woods, and, and...

291
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:14,523
这里不欢迎你
You're not welcome here!

292
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,427
对…对不起呀
I-I-I'm sorry.

293
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,065
你看什么？
What are you staring at?!

294
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,099
没什么
N-Nothing.

295
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:22,830
你是来看野兽的？
So, you've come to stare at the Beast, have you?!

296
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:24,701
对不起，我没有恶意
Please, I meant no harm!

297
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:26,365
我需要一个过夜的地方
I just needed a place to stay.

298
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:27,999
好，我给你一个地方过夜
I'll give you a place to stay.

299
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:31,676
求求你，不要…
Oh, no! Please! Oh, no!

300
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:40,449
我看贝儿今天一定会乐歪了  是不是，加斯顿？
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get the 
surprise of her life huh, Gaston?

301
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:43,354
对，我会让他永生难忘
Yep. This is her lucky day.

302
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,521
欢迎各位来参加我的婚礼
I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.

303
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:52,828
首先，我要进去向那女孩求婚
But first I'd better go in there and propose to the girl.

304
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,496
来富
And you, Lefou... 

305
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:58,263
当我和贝儿从大门出来的时候
now, when Belle and I come out that door...

306
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,466
我知道，我知道
Oh, I know, I know!

307
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:00,974
乐队开始演奏
I-I strike up the band.

308
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:05,975
还没有
Not yet!

309
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,174
对不起…
Sorry.

310
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,930
加斯顿，真是意外啊
Gaston. What a pleasant surprise.

311
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,088
没错
Isn't it, though?

312
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,497
的确会让你感到意外
I'm just full of surprises.

313
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,194
贝儿，你知道全城的女孩
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town

314
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,863
都希望能拥有你现在的地位
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

315
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,462
而我今天…
This is the day... Hmm. Yeah.

316
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:35,310
今天就能让你美梦成真
This is the day your dreams come true.

317
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,971
今天就能让你美梦成真
This is the day your dreams come true.

318
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,878
你怎么知道我的梦想是什么呢？
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?

319
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:42,711
当然了，来，想想看这个画面
Plenty. Here, picture this:

320
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,381
一个纯朴的乡村小屋
A rustic hunting lodge

321
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:48,581
我刚打的猎物正在火上烤着
my latest kill roasting on the fire

322
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,214
我的小妻子
and my little wife,

323
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,758
在帮我按摩着双腿
massaging my feet

324
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,559
孩子们和小狗玩着
while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs.

325
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:56,221
我们要养六个还是七个？
We'll have six or seven.

326
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:56,991
小狗？
Dogs?

327
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:58,588
不是，贝儿
No, Belle!

328
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,156
像我一样的儿子
Strapping boys, like me.

329
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:01,200
你真会想啊
Imagine that.

330
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:02,796
你知道那小妻子是谁吗？
And do you know who that little wife will be?

331
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:04,098
我猜猜看…
Let me think.

332
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:04,900
是你，贝儿
You, Belle.

333
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:05,995
加斯顿
Gaston, I'm...

334
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,736
你…你是开玩笑的吧？
I'm... speechless. 

335
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,274
我不知该说什么好？
I really don't know what to say.

336
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:12,607
说你愿意嫁给我
Say you'll marry me.

337
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:14,306
对不起，加斯顿
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

338
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:16,474
但是…
but... 

339
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,715
我实在是配不上你
I just don't deserve you. Whoa!

340
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,395
怎么样？结果如何啊？
So, how'd it go?

341
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:39,205
我一定要娶贝儿做我的妻子
I'll have Belle for my wife.

342
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:42,333
绝对要娶她
Make no mistake about that!

343
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,176
神气
Touchy.

344
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,684
他走了吗？
Is he gone?

345
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:56,884
你能相信吗？
Can you imagine?

346
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,653
他要我嫁给他
He asked me to marry him.

347
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,658
我？
Me, 

348
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,958
做那个粗俗又自大的人的太太？
the wife of that boorish, brainless...

349
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:06,894
加斯顿夫人，我怎能接受
Madame Gaston, Can't you just see it?

350
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:10,630
加斯顿夫人，是他新娘
Madame Gaston, His little wife

351
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:11,937
天啊，不要
No, sir,

352
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:12,836
别让它发生
not me, 

353
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,431
我要的生活不该是这样
I guarantee it

354
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:18,377
我希望走出枯躁无味的生活
I want much more than this provincial life

355
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:33,120
去探索那神秘宇宙
I want adventure in the great, wide somewhere

356
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:37,894
去找寻更多未知
I want it more than I can tell

357
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,897
在我茫然生命中
And for once it might be grand

358
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:45,372
需要有人了解我
To have someone understand

359
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:51,971
我想要的超过他们的预期
I want so much more than they've got planned.

360
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,150
费力？你怎么会在这里？
Philippe! What are you doing here?

361
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,584
费力？你怎么会在这里？
Philippe! What are you doing here?

362
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,446
爸爸呢？他在哪里？
Where's? Where's Papa? Where is he, 

363
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:01,511
费力，怎么回事啊
Philippe? What happened?

364
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:03,018
我们一定要找到他
Oh, we have to find him.

365
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:04,581
你快带我去找他
You have to take me to him.

366
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,966
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

367
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,969
费力，站好
Philippe, please! Steady!

368
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,978
站好
Steady.

369
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,279
爸爸
Papa.

370
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:35,486
你就不能老实点对不对？
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

371
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,990
非得把他留下来是不是？
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?

372
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,492
还请他喝什么茶
Serve him tea.

373
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:41,188
坐什么主人的位子
Sit in the master's chair.

374
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:42,422
还有个垫脚凳呢？
Pet the pooch.

375
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,327
我是在尽地主之谊啊
I was trying to be hospitable.

376
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,067
请问，有人在吗？
Hello? Is anyone here?

377
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:50,893
哈？
Hello? 

378
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,633
爸爸
Papa?

379
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:57,367
爸爸，你在这儿吗？
Papa? Are you here?

380
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,937
妈妈，城堡里有个女孩耶
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

381
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,279
阿齐，我不是告诉过你
Now, Chip, I'll not have you 

382
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,215
-不要胡思乱想的吗？-真的，妈妈
making up such wild stories. Really, Mama.

383
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,583
我看见了
I saw her.

384
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:08,622
不要再多说了，快洗澡去
Not another word. But... Into the tub.

385
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:09,587
女孩
Woop...

386
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:11,887
我看见城堡有个女孩哪
Well! I saw a girl in the castle!

387
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:14,527
你看，没错吧？
See? I told you.

388
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:15,357
你不负责任
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,

389
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,627
不听劝告，还死爱表现
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

390
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,667
爸爸？
Papa?

391
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:22,366
你看到了吗？
Did you see that?

392
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,301
是个女孩
It's a girl!

393
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,897
我知道是个女孩

394
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:28,938
就是她
I know it's a girl. Don't you see?

395
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,478
她就是我们等了很久
She's the one...the girl we have been waiting for.

396
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,137
来帮我们解开咒语的女孩
She has come to break the spell!

397
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:34,374
等一下，等等我啊
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

398
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:39,210
爸爸
Papa?

399
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:42,048
爸爸
Papa?

400
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:47,219
请问？有人在吗？
Hello? Is someone here?

401
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,192
等一等
Wait!

402
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,026
我是来找我爸爸的
I'm looking for my father. I...

403
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:54,662
奇怪
That's funny.

404
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,837
我刚刚明明听到有声音的
I'm sure there was someone.

405
00:22:58,406 --> 00:22:59,737
有人在吗？
L-ls anyone here?

406
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:01,067
贝儿
Belle?

407
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:02,838
爸爸
Papa!

408
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:06,579
你是怎么找到我的？
H-How did you find me?

409
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:08,273
你的手跟冰一样
Oh, your hands are like ice.

410
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:09,372
我一定要让你出来
I have to get you out of there.

411
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,475
贝儿，我要你赶快离开这里
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

412
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,712
谁把你关在这的？
Who's done this to you?

413
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,254
没时间解释了，你快走
No time to explain. You must go! Now!

414
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:16,813
我不会离你而去
I won't leave you!

415
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:17,755
你在做什么？
What are you doing here?

416
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:18,826
快跑，贝儿
Run, Belle!

417
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:20,360
谁？是谁？
Who's there? Who are you?

418
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,159
我是城堡的主人
The master of this castle.

419
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:25,031
我是来找我爸爸
I've come for my father.

420
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,191
我求求你放他出来
Please let him out.

421
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,461
他生病了
Can't you see he's sick?

422
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:29,627
他不该闯进这里
Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!

423
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:30,897
他会死的
But he could die.

424
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:32,597
我求求你，我愿意做任何事情
Please, I-I'll do anything.

425
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:35,107
你什么也不能做
There's nothing you can do.

426
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,336
他是我的囚犯
He's my prisoner.

427
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:39,312
一定会有什么办法可以…
Oh, there must be some way I can...

428
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,074
等一等
Wait!

429
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,316
让我来代替他
Take me instead.

430
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:48,783
你？
You?!

431
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:53,551
你愿意代替他？
You would... take his place?

432
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,891
贝儿，不可以的
Belle, no!

433
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:57,487
假如我愿意
You don't know what you're doing!

434
00:23:57,598 --> 00:23:58,826
你就会放他走？
If I did, would you let him go?

435
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,797
会
Yes.

436
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:03,462
但是你得答应永远留在这里
But you must promise to stay here forever.

437
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:07,300
请站到亮的地方来
Come into the light.

438
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:20,384
不行，贝儿
No, Belle!

439
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,183
我不答应你这么做
I won't let you do this!

440
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,588
我答应你
You have my word.

441
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:27,650
好
Done!

442
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:32,963
不，贝儿，你听着
No, Belle, listen to me.

443
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:35,025
我老了，活不了多久了
I'm old. I've lived my life.

444
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:35,830
等一下
Wait.

445
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:37,230
-贝儿 -等等…
Belle! Wait!

446
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,573
求求你放了我的女儿
No, please spare my daughter. Please!

447
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,906
她跟你已经没有关系了
She's no longer your concern.

448
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,878
-把他送回去 -放我出来
Take him to the village. Let me out!

449
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:49,178
放我出来…
Please let me out! Let me out!

450
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,013
求求你…
Please! Oh, please!

451
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,418
主人
Master?

452
00:24:58,493 --> 00:24:59,187
什么事
What?

453
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:03,225
既然那个女孩
要跟我们住上一段时间
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time

454
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:06,528
我在想，你也许应该…
I was thinking that you might want to offer her

455
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:08,364
给她一间较舒服的房间
a more comfortable room.

456
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:11,302
当我没说
Then again, maybe not.

457
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,236
你居然不让我说再见
You didn't even let me say good-bye.

458
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,574
我永远都看不到他了
I'll never see him again.

459
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,137
你却不让我说再见
I didn't get to say good-bye.

460
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:23,808
我带你去你的房间
I'll show you to your room.

461
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:25,977
我的房间？
My room?

462
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:26,712
我以为…
But I thought...

463
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:29,580
-你要住在塔里吗？ -不要
You want to stay in the tower? No.

464
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,782
那就跟我来…
Then follow me.

465
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:54,138
跟她说说话嘛
Say something to her. Huh? Oh.

466
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:59,253
我…我希望你会喜欢这里
I, uh, hope you like it here.

467
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:02,750
在这个城堡里
The castle is your home now,

468
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:04,382
你可以到任何一个地方
so you can go anywhere you like

469
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,790
除了西厢房
except the west wing.

470
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:06,723
为什么？
What's in the west?

471
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,193
那是禁区
It's forbidden!

472
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,869
假如你需要什么
Now, if you need anything

473
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:18,935
我的仆人会拿给你
my servants will attend you.

474
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,405
邀她一块儿晚餐
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

475
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:24,110
待会儿你要跟我一起吃晚餐
You will join me for dinner.

476
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:25,645
但这不是要求
That's not a request!

477
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:45,694
她以为她是谁呀？
Who does she think she is?

478
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,166
根本没把我放在眼里
That girl has tangled with the wrong man.

479
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:49,964
居然敢跟我说“不”
No one says no to Gaston.

480
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:51,334
你说的对
Darn right.

481
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,304
推辞，拒绝
Dismissed, rejected...

482
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:55,569
当着那么多人的面 丢尽我的脸
publicly humiliated.

483
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:57,577
叫我以后怎么做人嘛
Why, it's more than I can bear.

484
00:26:57,678 --> 00:26:58,645
还要啤酒吗？
More beer?

485
00:26:58,746 --> 00:26:59,644
干什么？
What for?

486
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:01,113
没有用的？
Nothing helps.

487
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,376
丢死人了
I'm disgraced.

488
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,542
谁，你？
Who, you?

489
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:04,379
不可能的啊
Never!

490
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:04,652
加斯顿，你一定要振作起来
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.

491
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:08,816
加斯顿，你一定要振作起来
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.

492
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:12,086
为何你会如此颓丧，加斯顿
Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston

493
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,650
看起来如此绝望
Looking so down in the dumps

494
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:18,264
虽然你有不少缺点，加斯顿
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston

495
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:21,392
大家希望能像你
Even when taking your lumps

496
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,570
在小城中每个人都羡慕你
There's no man in town as admired as you

497
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:28,267
因为所有的人都爱你
You're everyone's favorite guy

498
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:31,277
人人都尊重你也敬畏你
Everyone's awed and inspired by you

499
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:38,716
你是我心目中的希望
And it's not very hard to see why

500
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:44,949
没人像你一样机灵，加斯顿
No... one's... Slick as Gaston

501
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,548
没人像你一样敏锐，加斯顿
No one's quick as Gaston

502
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:49,787
没人有你那强壮的肌肉 加斯顿
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston

503
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:53,697
你翩翩风度多么地迷人
For there's no man in town half as manly

504
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,268
你更是我们的榜样
Perfect, a pure paragon

505
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:59,736
你可以去向任何人打听
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley

506
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,867
他们一定会跟随在你的身旁
And they'll tell you whose team
They prefer to be on, Ooh!

507
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:09,473
没人像你，加斯顿
No... one's... been like Gaston

508
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,073
你是偶像，加斯顿
A kingpin like Gaston

509
00:28:11,184 --> 00:28:14,312
没人能比你更英俊潇洒，加斯顿
No one's got a full cleft

510
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:16,218
在这世界上没人
In his chin like Gaston

511
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:18,290
能比我强
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

512
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:21,451
人人崇拜的加斯顿
My, what a guy, that Gaston

513
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:24,826
为他欢呼、为他喝采
Give five "hurrahs!" Give 12 "hip-hips!"

514
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:29,561
加斯顿是最好的没人比得上他
Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips

515
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:34,603
没人像你，加斯顿
No... one... Fights like Gaston

516
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:36,334
骁勇善战，加斯顿
Douses lights like Gaston

517
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:39,639
没人胜过你，别想打败加斯顿
In a wrestling match, nobody bites like Gaston

518
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:42,943
因为你拥有了强壮的身体
For there's no one as burly and brawny

519
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:46,417
还有健美的结实肌肉
As you see, I've got biceps to spare

520
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,285
而且绝没有松弛的赘肉
Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny That's right

521
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,984
我结实的胸口还长满胸毛
And every last inch of me's covered with hair

522
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,754
勇敢坚强，加斯顿
No one hits like Gaston

523
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:56,454
聪明机智，加斯顿
Matches wits like Gaston

524
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:57,927
就连嚼烟草
In a spitting match,

525
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,794
也没人胜过加斯顿
nobody spits like Gaston

526
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:03,893
嚼烟草的功夫是无人能比
I'm especially good at expectorating

527
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,637
完美的加斯顿
Ptooey! Ten points for Gaston!

528
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,271
当我年少
When I was a lad

529
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:09,898
每天都最少吃四打蛋
I ate four dozen eggs

530
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:13,434
以帮助我的长大
Every morning to help me get large

531
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:16,606
而如今我长大要多吃一打
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs

532
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:22,621
使我看起来像座高山
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

533
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:27,284
没人像你，加斯顿
No... one... Shoots like Gaston

534
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:27,627
百发百中，加斯顿
Makes those beauts like Gaston

535
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:28,958
百发百中，加斯顿
Makes those beauts like Gaston

536
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:32,528
穿着神气皮靴与众不同 加斯顿
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston

537
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:36,625
我用美丽的鹿角来做成装饰
I use antlers in all of my decorating

538
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:41,935
我的偶像，加斯顿
My, what a guy, Gaston!

539
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:51,210
救命，请帮帮我
Help! Help! Someone help me!

540
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:54,377
-莫维斯？ -我需要各位的帮助啊
Maurice? Please, please! I need your help.

541
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:56,887
他把她关在牢里了
He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon.

542
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:57,615
谁呀？
Who?

543
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,123
贝儿，快去救她
Belle. We must go.

544
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:01,022
晚了就来不及了
N-Not a minute to lose.

545
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:03,424
说慢一点，莫维斯
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

546
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:05,429
谁把贝儿关在牢里了
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?

547
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,159
野兽，一只可怕的怪物
A beast! A horrible,  monstrous

548
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:09,428
野兽
beast.

549
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,268
-很大的野兽？ -巨大的
Is it a big beast? Huge!

550
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,774
一张又大又丑的嘴
With a long ugly snout?

551
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:19,310
又丑又恐怖
Hideously ugly.

552
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:20,845
还有又利又尖的爪子？
And sharp, cruel fangs?

553
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:22,039
是的，是的
Yes, yes.

554
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:22,841
你会帮我吗？
Will you help me?

555
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:24,473
好吧，老头
All right, old man.

556
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,881
我们大家都会帮你的
We'll help you out.

557
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:26,940
真的？
You will?

558
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:27,686
谢谢…
Oh, thank you.

559
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,654
谢谢…
Thank you. Thank you! Oh! Oh!

560
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,186
神经的莫维斯
Crazy old Maurice.

561
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:37,250
这老小子就是喜欢出这种洋相
He's always good for a laugh.

562
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:44,926
神经的老莫维斯…
Crazy old Maurice, hmm? Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

563
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:48,868
来富，我突然有个想法
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking

564
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,931
-一定非常可怕 -没错
A dangerous pastime... I know

565
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,170
但那可怜老头是贝儿父亲
But that wacky old coot is Belle's father

566
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,373
而他看起来像个白痴
And his sanity's only so-so

567
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:01,748
现在我脑子不停在转动
Now the wheels in my head have been turning

568
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,947
一个计划浮现我脑海
Since I looked at that loony old man

569
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:06,724
因我曾说过要把贝儿娶回家
See, I promised myself

570
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:08,419
因我曾说过要把贝儿娶回家
I'd be married to Belle

571
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:12,929
这诺言马上就会实现
And right now, I'm evolving a plan

572
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,930
假如我能把她…
If I...

573
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:16,624
行吗？ 然后我们就可以…
Yes?   Then we...

574
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,327
这她肯吗？
No! Would she?

575
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,096
猜猜看我明白了…
Guess! Now I get it!

576
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:22,001
我们走
Let's go!

577
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:26,532
没人像你，加斯顿
No... one... Plots like Gaston

578
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,077
诡计最多，加斯顿
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

579
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:31,611
会用那卑劣手段只有你加斯顿
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston

580
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:37,176
很快就能为他举办婚礼喜宴
So his marriage we soon will be celebrating

581
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:43,352
我的偶像，加斯顿
My, what a guy! Gaston!

582
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,261
难道就没有人肯帮我吗？
Will no one help me?

583
00:31:58,876 --> 00:31:59,535
谁呀？
Who is it?

584
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,202
茶煲太太
Mrs. Potts, dear.

585
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,071
先喝杯热茶
I thought you might like a spot of tea.

586
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,549
你是？你是…
But you're... you're a... Ooh!

587
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:09,681
小心
Careful.

588
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:11,186
怎么可能？
This is impossible.

589
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,985
我知道，希望没吓到你
I know it is. But here we are.

590
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:16,651
妈妈，我说过她很漂亮的，对吧？
I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I?

591
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,321
好了，别说了
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.

592
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:21,488
小心点，别洒了
Slowly now. Don't spill.

593
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:23,325
谢谢你
Thank you.

594
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,031
你要不要看我玩特技
Want to see me do a trick?

595
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:28,434
阿齐
Chip!

596
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:30,537
对不起
Oops. Sorry.

597
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:33,132
我觉得你是一位非常勇敢的女孩子
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.

598
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,733
我们都是这么想的
We all think so.

599
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:36,404
但是我失去了我爸爸
But I've lost my father,

600
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,344
我的梦想，所有的一切
my dreams... everything.

601
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,576
开心一点
Cheer up, child.

602
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:43,085
事情总会好转的
It'll turn out all right in the end.

603
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:44,518
放心吧
You'll see. Oh, listen to me.

604
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:48,421
晚餐的时候你可以跟他好好地聊聊
Jabbering on while there's a supper
to get on the table.

605
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:49,457
阿齐
Chip!

606
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,720
拜拜
Bye.

607
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,857
好了
Well, now, 

608
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:54,555
我们晚餐的时候该穿什么呢？
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

609
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:57,299
让我看看柜子里有些什么衣服
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers.

610
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:00,160
真不好意思
Ooh! How embarrassing.

611
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:03,837
有了
Ah, here we are.

612
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,898
穿这件会让你看起来令人着迷
You'll look ravishing in this one.

613
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,203
谢谢你的好意
That's very kind of you, 

614
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:09,404
可是我不会跟他一块儿吃晚餐的
but... I'm not going to dinner.

615
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:12,071
那怎么行
Oh, but you must.

616
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:17,449
小姐，晚餐好了
Dinner is served.

617
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:21,220
怎么这么久？
What's taking so long?

618
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:23,121
我跟她说过要她下来的
I told her to come down.

619
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:24,750
她为什么还不来？
Why isn't she here yet?

620
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,795
有点耐性嘛，主人
Oh, try to be patient, sir.

621
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:30,264
可怜她在一天之内失去了父亲跟自由
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom, all in one day.

622
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:31,731
主人，你有没有想过
Master, have you thought

623
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,632
这个善良美丽的女孩也许会解开咒语？
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

624
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:36,398
我当然想过
Of course I have.

625
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:37,473
我又不是傻瓜
I'm not a fool.

626
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:38,404
好极了
Good!

627
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,966
你爱她，她也爱你
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

628
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,943
然后，咒语就解开了
and poof! The spell is broken.

629
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,947
我们就可以变回人类了
We'll be human again by midnight.

630
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:48,882
这事不容易，需要时间啊
Ooh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

631
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:51,147
但是玫瑰花已经开始凋谢了
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

632
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:55,982
没有用的，她那么美
Oh, it's no use. She's so beautiful,

633
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:57,184
我呢？
and I'm... Well, look at me!

634
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,495
所以你要想办法让她了解你
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.

635
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:03,820
我不知怎么做
I don't know how.

636
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:07,327
先把你凶恶的外表改一改
Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable.

637
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:09,462
站直了，像个绅士一样
Straighten up. Try to act like a gentleman.

638
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:11,005
当她进来的时候
Ah, yes. When she comes in

639
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:13,803
给她一个礼貌愉快的笑容
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

640
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,171
快，笑给我看看
Come, come, show me the smile.

641
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:17,805
这样会吓着她的
But don't frighten the poor girl.

642
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,371
以你的才智给她一个好印象
Impress her with your rapier wit.

643
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:21,380
而且要温柔
But be gentle.

644
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:22,814
多多赞美她
Shower her with compliments.

645
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:23,816
可是要有诚意
But be sincere.

646
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:27,652
最重要的还得要控制自己的脾气
And above all... You must control your temper!

647
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:29,487
她来了
Here she is!

648
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,051
晚安
Good evening.

649
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:36,189
她在哪里？
Well, where is she?

650
00:34:36,497 --> 00:34:38,397
谁？
Who? Oh.

651
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:39,125
那个女孩？
The girl, yes.

652
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,464
是，有个女孩
The... girl.

653
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:42,331
事实上
Well, actually,

654
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:45,130
她现在…正处于…
she's in the process of...

655
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,332
这种情况…
Circumstances being 

656
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:49,501
她…她不来了
what they are... She's not coming.

657
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:51,670
什么？
What?!

658
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:55,510
主人，主人
But, Your Grace!

659
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,379
请你不要太急躁
Your Eminence!

660
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:01,981
我说过要你下来吃晚饭
I thought I told you to come down to dinner!

661
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:03,283
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

662
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:05,555
你快点出来
You come out, or I'll...

663
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,491
不然我打烂这扇门
I'll... I'll break down the door!

664
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:09,358
主人，也许我说得不对
Master... I could be wrong,

665
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,890
但这种方法是不能打动一个女孩的芳心的
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

666
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:17,459
如果你能像个绅士，也许会好一点
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

667
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:20,301
她实在是太不可理喻了
But she is being so difficult.

668
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:23,434
温柔…
Gently, gently.

669
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:26,211
你下来吃饭吗？
Will you come down to dinner?

670
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,804
不要
No.  Hmm?  Ah, ah, ah!

671
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,583
礼貌、绅士
Suave, genteel.

672
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:34,686
不知道我有没有这份荣幸…
It would give me great pleasure

673
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:36,814
跟你一块儿共进晚餐？
if you would join me for dinner.

674
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:37,982
说“请”
We say please.

675
00:35:38,993 --> 00:35:40,392
-请… -不要，谢谢
Please.  No, thank you!

676
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:41,961
你不可能永远在里面
You can't stay in there forever!

677
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:42,722
我可以
Yes, I can.

678
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:47,325
好，你就在里面挨饿
Fine. Then go ahead and starve!

679
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:49,801
她如果不肯跟我吃晚饭
If she doesn't eat with me,

680
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:52,267
她就永远没有饭吃
then she doesn't eat at all.

681
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:56,568
天啊
Oh, dear.

682
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:58,445
他的脾气怎么还是不改？
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

683
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:01,414
卢米亚，你在这守着
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

684
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:02,710
如果有任何情况
and inform me at once

685
00:36:02,816 --> 00:36:04,681
就马上来通知我听见没有？
if there is the slightest change.

686
00:36:04,785 --> 00:36:06,616
这件事就交给我了
You can count on me, mon capitan.

687
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:10,317
我看我们还是先下楼
Well, we might as well go downstairs

688
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,086
下去收拾收拾吧
and start cleaning up.

689
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,551
我好声好气地请她都被拒绝了
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

690
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:17,688
她到底想要我怎么样？
Well, what does she want me to do...

691
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:18,561
求她？
beg?

692
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,726
我要看那个女孩
Show me the girl.

693
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:27,029
一旦你了解他就会明白他不是个坏人
Well, the master's really not so bad
once you get to know him.

694
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:29,132
你为什么不给他一个机会呢？
Why don't you give him a chance?

695
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:30,938
我不想了解他
I don't want to get to know him.

696
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:31,713
我才不要跟他有任何牵连
I don't want to have anything to do with him!

697
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,305
我才不要跟他有任何牵连
I don't want to have anything to do with him!

698
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:37,712
我只是自欺欺人
I'm just fooling myself.

699
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:40,310
她不会把我当正常人看的
She'll never see me as anything...

700
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:42,216
我永远是野兽
but a monster.

701
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:48,855
没希望的
It's hopeless.

702
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:08,879
-不要 -要
Oh, no!  Oh, yes!

703
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:09,711
不要
Oh, no!

704
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:11,581
要…
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

705
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:14,450
人家以前被你烫过
I've been burned by you before.

706
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,316
我的天啊，她跑出来了
Zut, alors! She has emerged!

707
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:28,902
好了，快跟哥哥姐姐一块进橱子里去吧
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

708
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:30,563
人家不想睡嘛
But I'm not sleepy.

709
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:31,896
该睡了
Yes, you are.

710
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:33,405
不，我不要
No, I'm not.

711
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,142
我忙了一整天
I work and I slave all day long

712
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,199
是为了什么？
and for what?

713
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:40,341
白白浪费我那么好的烹调技术
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste.

714
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:41,846
你不要再抱怨了
Oh, stop your grousing.

715
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:43,644
今天每个人都很累了
It's been a long night for all of us.

716
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:46,914
依我看她也太过份了
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn.

717
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:48,511
我们主人都已经说请了
After all, he did say please.

718
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:51,250
他一定要试着控制脾气
But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper

719
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:52,053
否则他永远…
he'll never break...

720
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,424
真…真高兴见到你
Splendid to see you out and about, Mademoiselle.

721
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:56,895
我是葛士华
I am Cogsworth,

722
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:58,625
是这里的总管
head of the household.

723
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:01,295
他是卢米亚
This is Lumiere.

724
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,563
认识你是我的荣幸
Enchante, cherie.

725
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:06,902
如果有什么需要我为你服务的话
If there's... Stop that! ...anything we... Please!

726
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,738
尽量吩咐
Can do to make your stay more comfortable.

727
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:11,539
我有点饿了
I am a little hungry.

728
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:13,510
听见了没有？
You are? Hear that? 

729
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,239
她饿了
She's hungry.

730
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:15,246
快生火
Stoke the fire.

731
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,478
拿出银器，叫醒瓷碟
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

732
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:19,984
不要忘记主人的交待
Remember what the master said.

733
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:20,951
我才不管呢
Oh, pishposh.

734
00:38:21,021 --> 00:38:23,319
反正我是不会让孩子挨饿的
I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry.

735
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:24,721
好吧
All right, fine.

736
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,084
一杯水一个面包就行了
Glass of water, crust of bread, and then...

737
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,996
葛士华，我真服了你
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

738
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,156
她不是犯人
She is not a prisoner.

739
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,492
她是我们的贵客
She's our guest.

740
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,630
我们一定要让她觉得亲切
We must make her feel welcome here.

741
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,396
小姐，这边请
Right this way, Mademoiselle.

742
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:37,231
好吧，小声一点
Well, keep it down.

743
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:38,563
要是被主人听见了
If the master finds out about this

744
00:38:38,672 --> 00:38:39,764
我们就惨了
it will be our necks.

745
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:42,000
当然，当然
Of course, of course.

746
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:44,943
可是一顿丰盛的晚餐怎么能没有音乐
But what is dinner without a little music?

747
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:46,843
音乐？
Music?

748
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:50,515
亲爱的小姐
Ma chere mademoiselle.

749
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:54,144
很荣幸有这个机会为你服务
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure

750
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:55,984
诚心欢迎你
that we welcome you tonight.

751
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,358
现在请先上座
And now we invite you to relax.

752
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:58,689
现在请先上座
And now we invite you to relax.

753
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,124
放松心情
Let us pull up a chair

754
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:02,787
享受本餐厅特别为你准备的…
as the dining room proudly presents...

755
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,891
晚餐

00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:11,300
请享用，小贵客
Be... our... guest, Be our guest

757
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:13,704
我们可爱的贵客
Put our service to the test

758
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:16,002
请把餐巾先围好
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie

759
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,408
让我们来为你服务
And we provide the rest

760
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:22,916
热汤先上，服务至上
Soup du jour, Hot hors d'oeuvres 
Why, we only live to serve

761
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:25,382
再请尝些小西点它味道既甜又美
Try the gray stuff, It's delicious

762
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:27,681
不要怀疑，问问餐具
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

763
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,950
它们能唱，它们能跳
They can sing, they can dance

764
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,252
你现在是在法国
After all, Miss, this is France

765
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:36,293
想要饱餐一顿就到这里来
And a dinner here is never second best

766
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:38,797
首先请打开菜单
Go on, unfold your menu

767
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,958
选出你所想要
Take a glance and then

请享用，小贵客
You'll be our guest, Oui, our guest,

771
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,666
派和布丁是甜点
Pie and pudding en flambe

772
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,745
所有美食呈现给你
We'll prepare and serve with flair

773
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:53,938
唯有贵客才拥有
A culinary cabaret

774
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,311
你孤单，你惊慌
You're alone and you're scared

775
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:58,317
我们会给你温暖
But the banquet's all prepared

776
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:01,286
当你看到银器飞舞
No one's gloomy or complaining

777
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,720
你将忘掉所有烦恼
While the flatware's entertaining

778
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:04,654
说笑话，耍特技
We tell jokes, I do tricks

779
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:06,988
大家一起陪伴你
With my fellow candlesticks

780
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,962
你可放心，大胆地享用
And it's all in perfect taste, that you can bet

781
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:13,123
来吧，举杯吧
Come on and lift your glass

782
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:15,201
做我们的贵客
You've won your own free pass

783
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:17,497
请享用，别烦恼
To be our guest... If you're stressed

784
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:19,595
尽情享受这晚餐
It's fine dining we suggest...

785
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:21,901
请享用，小贵客
Be our guest, be our guest

786
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:23,840
请享用
Be our guest!

787
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:27,978
欢笑离去
Life is so unnerving

788
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:30,448
忽然人们不需要你
For a servant who's not serving

789
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,816
没有灵魂的他不再完整
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon

790
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,377
走开啦
Get off!

791
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:40,392
过去的那些美好时光
Ah, those good old days when we were useful

792
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:44,864
忽然间消失得无影踪
Suddenly, those good old days are gone

793
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:47,230
十年盼望等待
Ten years we've been rusting

794
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,599
得到的只有那尘埃
Needing so much more than dusting

795
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:54,763
希望有机会能让我们重生
Needing exercise, A chance to use our skills

796
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,609
寂寞地生活在城堡
Most days we just lay around the castle

797
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,238
无所事事
Flabby, fat and lazy

798
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:03,180
是你燃起我们活力
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

799
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:05,217
小贵客…小贵客…
It's a guest, it's a guest!

800
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:06,877
你出现带来生气和欢笑
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

801
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:08,784
酒已斟满，感谢上天
Wine's been poured, and thank the Lord

802
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:10,914
我早把桌巾烫平
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

803
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:12,958
吃甜点，配热茶
With dessert, she'll want tea

804
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,891
亲爱的，这样最美
And, my dear, that's fine with me

805
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:17,088
当小茶杯开心地扭动
While the cups do their soft-shoeing

806
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:18,631
不停飞舞心情开朗
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

807
00:41:18,732 --> 00:41:22,498
水快开，把我身上污点洗干净
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sake, is that a spot?

808
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:25,868
我们要给她好印象
Clean it up, we want the company impressed

809
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:28,066
你想要加多少？
We've got a lot to do

810
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:29,904
是一勺或二勺
Is it one lump or two?

811
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,272
热诚欢迎请享用
For you, our guest

812
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:33,108
-小贵客 -小贵客
She's our guest, She's our guest

813
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:35,078
小贵客这一切都只为你
She's our guest, She's our guest

814
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:37,776
拜托，请小声一点
People, fun's over, over here, line up...

815
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:41,753
在这十年没有任何人到这里来
It's ten years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed

816
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:43,720
这佳肴和美食
With your meal, with your ease

817
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:45,587
是全都为你准备
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

818
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:48,992
当那烛光闪耀发亮
While the candlelight's still glowing

819
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:52,630
我们歌声绝不会停
Let us help you, we'll keep going

820
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:58,971
为你歌，为你唱
Course... by... course, One by one

821
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,336
直到你说我饱了
Till you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"

822
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:06,070
我们会用歌声送你入梦乡
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest

823
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:08,204
今晚有我们陪伴
Tonight you'll prop, your feet up

824
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,873
但你要先吃饱
But for now, let's eat up

825
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:13,544
请享用，请享用
Be our guest, be our guest

826
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:21,686
请享用…
Be our guest, Please be our guest!

827
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,692
好棒，唱得实在是太好了
Bravo! That was wonderful.

828
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,897
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you, 

829
00:42:31,972 --> 00:42:35,066
小姐，表演得很好对不对？
Mademoiselle. Good show, wasn't it?

830
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:35,972
好了，各位
Yes, everyone.

831
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,401
天啊，看看几点了？
My goodness, look at the time.

832
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:41,242
小姐，你该上床去睡觉了
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

833
00:42:41,348 --> 00:42:43,873
我怎么睡得着呢？
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

834
00:42:43,951 --> 00:42:45,851
这是我在魔法城堡的第一晚啊
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

835
00:42:45,953 --> 00:42:48,046
魔法？
Enchanted!

836
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:51,454
谁说这城堡被施了魔法？
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?

837
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:53,015
是你，对不对？
It was you, wasn't it?

838
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:54,889
是我自己瞎猜的
I figured it out for myself.

839
00:42:57,064 --> 00:42:59,965
如果可以的话，我想到处去看看
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.

840
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,125
你想参观一下吗？
Oh, would you like a tour?

841
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:02,634
等一下，等一下
Wait a second, wait a second.

842
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:05,103
这不是一个很好的建议
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

843
00:43:05,205 --> 00:43:10,472
主人要是知道让她乱走的话你跟我就惨啦
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places, if you know what I mean.

844
00:43:10,577 --> 00:43:12,010
也许你能带我参观
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

845
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:14,137
我相信你对这座城堡
I'm sure you know everything

846
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:15,203
一定非常了解
there is to know about the castle.

847
00:43:16,717 --> 00:43:20,153
事实上…没错
Oh, well, actually, I, uh... Yes, I do.

848
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:24,649
它是由洛可可精心设计的
As you can see, the pseudo-facade was stripped away

849
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,988
虽然表面已经有些剥落
to reveal a minimalist rococo design.

850
00:43:27,094 --> 00:43:30,029
至于天花板呢
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.

851
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:33,658
是新古典主义巴洛克风格的创作
This is yet another example of 
the late neoclassic baroque period.

852
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:35,462
就好像我常说的
And, as I always say

853
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:37,901
巴洛克风格最美
if it's not baroque, don't fix it.

854
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,034
我说到哪里了？
Uh, where was I?

855
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:45,140
至于…没事
As you were.

856
00:43:45,212 --> 00:43:47,908
不知道你有没有仔细注意
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses 

857
00:43:48,015 --> 00:43:50,677
上面的那些柱子
above the...Uh, Mademoiselle?

858
00:43:56,456 --> 00:43:57,980
-那上面有什么？ -哪里？
What's up there? Where? There?

859
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:00,025
没什么，没什么好看的
Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing
of interest at all 

860
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:03,722
西厢房又脏又乱，对不对
in the west wing. Dusty, dull, very boring.

861
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,321
那就是西厢房
Ah, so that's the west wing.

862
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,167
好聪明
Nice going.

863
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:11,169
不知道他在那里藏了些什么？
I wonder what he's hiding up there?

864
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:12,033
藏？
Hiding?

865
00:44:12,105 --> 00:44:13,732
主人没有藏任何东西
The master is hiding nothing.

866
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,273
那为什么不准去呢？
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

867
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:19,675
也许你喜欢看看些别的
Perhaps, uh, Mademoiselle would like to

868
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,408
我们有很漂亮的壁毯，就挂在那边
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

869
00:44:22,516 --> 00:44:23,540
等等再说
maybe later.

870
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:26,882
你要不要去看看花园，或…或图书馆？
Th-The gardens or-or the-the-the-the library, perhaps.

871
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:28,113
你们有图书馆？
You have a library?

872
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:30,186
是的…当然有
Yes, oh, indeed.

873
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:30,916
都是书
With books.

874
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,453
-好多的书 -像山一样高
Scads of books! Mountains of books!

875
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:34,516
就跟田一样地广
Forests of books!

876
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:35,583
-整齐的 -排好的
- Cascades! - Longboats!

877
00:44:35,662 --> 00:44:36,686
数不尽的书
Swamps of books!

878
00:44:36,763 --> 00:44:39,391
你一辈子都看不完的书
More books than you'll
ever be able to read in a lifetime.

879
00:44:39,466 --> 00:44:41,457
各式各样的书
Books on every subject ever studied,

880
00:44:41,535 --> 00:44:43,036
世界各国的名著
by every author

881
00:44:43,036 --> 00:44:44,128
世界各国的名著
by every author

882
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:25,851
谁准你到这来的？
Why did you come here?

883
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:27,888
对…对不起
I'm... I'm sorry.

884
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:30,549
我警告过你不准来这的
I warned you never to come here.

885
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:31,819
我没有恶意
I didn't mean any harm.

886
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:34,554
你知道你会弄坏什么吗？
Do you realize what you could have done?!

887
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:36,689
求求你，别这样
Please, stop.

888
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:38,356
滚
Get out!

889
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:39,455
不…
No!

890
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:44,262
滚
Get... out!

891
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:56,973
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

892
00:46:57,052 --> 00:46:58,178
不管我答应过什么
Promise or no promise

893
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:00,186
我都要离开这里
I can't stay here another minute.

894
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:01,949
不，小姐，别走
Oh, no, wait, please.

895
00:47:02,057 --> 00:47:03,081
你别走啊
Please wait.

896
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:33,636
来，把手给我
Here now. Oh, don't do that.

897
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:38,635
我帮你擦擦
Just hold still.

898
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:41,007
好痛
That hurts!

899
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,275
如果你不乱动就不会那么痛了
If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!

900
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:45,647
都是你跑走才害得我受伤的
Well, if you hadn't have run away
this wouldn't have happened!

901
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:48,345
要不是你吓我我才不会跑走呢？
If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away!

902
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:51,983
你不应该到西厢房去
Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing!

903
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:54,159
你才应该学学控制自己的脾气
Well, you should learn to control your temper!

904
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,764
忍着些
Now hold still.

905
00:49:59,865 --> 00:50:01,423
这会有一点点刺痛
This might sting a little.

906
00:50:04,237 --> 00:50:05,329
对了
By the way, 

907
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:08,301
谢谢你刚才救了我
thank you. For saving my life.

908
00:50:13,246 --> 00:50:14,235
不客气
You're welcome.

909
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:25,785
通常在晚上我是不会离开疯人院的
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night

910
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:28,951
可是你说这趟很值得来
but he said you'd make it worth my while.

911
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,497
请说吧
I'm listening.

912
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:34,361
是这样的
It's like this.

913
00:50:34,433 --> 00:50:37,129
我已经决定要娶贝儿
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle

914
00:50:37,236 --> 00:50:40,205
但她还需要一点…催促
but she needs a little... persuasion.

915
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,735
她直接拒绝他了
Turned him down flat.

916
00:50:43,342 --> 00:50:45,810
每个人都知道她爸爸是疯子
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

917
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:47,378
他今晚他还一直乱吼
He was in here tonight

918
00:50:47,446 --> 00:50:49,209
说在城堡中有只野兽
raving about a beast in a castle.

919
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:50,942
莫维斯不会伤人
Maurice is harmless.

920
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,176
重点是
The point is,

921
00:50:52,285 --> 00:50:54,412
贝儿愿意做任何事
Belle would do anything

922
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:56,114
只要不把她爸爸关进疯人院里
to keep him from being locked up.

923
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:02,261
对，甚至嫁给他
Yeah. Even marry him.

924
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:05,128
你们要我把她父亲带到疯人院
So you want me to throw her father into the asylum

925
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:05,465
威胁贝儿嫁给你
unless she agrees to marry you.

926
00:51:05,465 --> 00:51:07,592
威胁贝儿嫁给你
unless she agrees to marry you.

927
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:10,731
太卑鄙了…
Oh, that is despicable.

928
00:51:12,138 --> 00:51:13,400
但我喜欢
I love it!

929
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:17,202
假如没有人帮忙
If no one will help me

930
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:18,970
我就自己去
then I'll go back alone.

931
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:20,773
没什么大不了的
Yes, is that everything?

932
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:22,143
不在乎任何代价
I don't care what it takes.

933
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:24,716
一定要找到那个城堡
I'll find that castle, and somehow

934
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:26,444
把贝儿救出来
I'll get her out of there.

935
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:34,351
贝儿？莫维斯？
Belle? Maurice?

936
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,825
没人
Oh, well.

937
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:38,090
我看这招对她是没用的
I guess it's not going to work after all.

938
00:51:38,197 --> 00:51:40,757
他们总得要回来的
They have to come back sometime.

939
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,460
而且等他们回来的时候
And when they do,

940
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:44,662
我们已经准备好了
we'll be ready for them.

941
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:45,634
来富
Lefou...

942
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:48,733
从现在起不准你离开这里
don't move from that spot

943
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:50,900
直到贝儿跟她爸爸回来为止
until Belle and her father come home.

944
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:53,206
可是，可是我…
But, but, I...

945
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,806
疯子
Aw, nuts.

946
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:21,766
我从来没有对任何人有过这种感觉
I've never felt this way about anyone.

947
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:27,309
我想为她做点事，做什么好呢？
I want to do something for her. But what?

948
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:30,211
通常的情形是送花
Well, there's the usual things.

949
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:31,271
或是巧克力
Flowers, chocolates.

950
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,715
要不然就是不切实际的承诺
Promises you don't intend to keep.

951
00:52:32,785 --> 00:52:34,275
不对，不对
Ah, no, no.

952
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:36,913
应该要特别一点的
It has to be something very special.

953
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,522
而且她有兴趣的
Something that sparks her interest.

954
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:40,524
我知道了
Wait a minute!

955
00:52:43,095 --> 00:52:44,790
贝儿
Belle,

956
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:47,331
我想带你看样东西
there's something I want to show you.

957
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:51,432
但首先你要先闭上眼睛
But first, you have to close your eyes.

958
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:55,065
是一个惊喜
It's a surprise.

959
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:07,115
好了没有？
Can I open them?

960
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:08,914
慢点，还没有
No, no. Not yet.

961
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:11,313
等一下
Wait here.

962
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:18,057
现在可以睁开了吗？
Now can I open them?

963
00:53:18,464 --> 00:53:19,362
可以了
All right.

964
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:20,958
睁开吧
Now.

965
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,808
我是不是在做梦啊？
I can't believe it!

966
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,310
我从来没看过这么多书
I've never seen so many books in all my life!

967
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:35,880
你…你喜欢吗？
You-You like it?

968
00:53:35,948 --> 00:53:37,677
当然喜欢
It's wonderful!

969
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,274
那就都是你的了
Then it's yours.

970
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:41,676
谢谢你，太棒了
Oh, thank you so much.

971
00:53:41,787 --> 00:53:43,914
看哪
Oh, would you look at that!

972
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:45,047
我就知道一定有用
I knew it would work.

973
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:46,624
什么？什么有用？
What? What worked?

974
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,720
真令人高兴
It's very encouraging.

975
00:53:49,828 --> 00:53:50,852
好兴奋啊？
Isn't this exciting?

976
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,521
我什么也没看见啊
I didn't see anything.

977
00:53:52,598 --> 00:53:53,394
走吧，阿齐
Come along, Chip.

978
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:55,194
厨房还有很多事要做
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.

979
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:55,634
什么事情？告诉我啦
But what are they talking about? What's going on?

980
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:57,864
什么事情？告诉我啦
But what are they talking about? What's going on?

981
00:53:57,936 --> 00:53:59,130
妈妈
Come on, Mom.

982
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,647
一种甜蜜
There's something sweet

983
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,549
且慈悲感觉
And almost kind

984
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,679
但他那么凶，那么鲁莽
But he was mean

985
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,189
那么粗俗
and he was coarse and unrefined

986
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,255
现在他和蔼可亲
And now he's dear, 

987
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:57,226
且小心翼翼
and so unsure

988
00:54:57,328 --> 00:55:00,923
不知为何之前我都没有察觉
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

989
00:55:14,546 --> 00:55:18,277
我感觉到她在看我
She glanced this way I thought I saw

990
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:22,183
当我靠近她已不会再逃避我
And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw

991
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:25,916
难道是梦使我欢欣
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore

992
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:29,926
但她从未用那种眼神看我
But then she's never looked at me that way before

993
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:38,628
有一些心动
New and a bit alarming

994
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:47,107
有谁会相信这样的事情
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?

995
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:54,144
他的确不是潇洒王子
True that he's no Prince Charming

996
00:55:54,252 --> 00:55:57,187
我相信他身后
But there's something in him

997
00:55:57,288 --> 00:56:01,054
一定有许多我没看到的事
That I simply didn't see...

998
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:03,892
谁能预料，谁能想像
Well, who'd have thought?

999
00:56:03,995 --> 00:56:06,259
难道是梦，但已发生
Well, bless my soul, Well, who'd have known?

1000
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:07,298
一个美女
Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed

1001
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:09,094
她会看上一个野兽
They'd come together on their own?

1002
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:11,863
这真稀奇，只有等待
It's so peculiar, We'll wait and see

1003
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,801
再过几天
A few days more

1004
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:16,932
也许就会有奇迹出现
There may be something there
that wasn't there before...

1005
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:23,303
也许就会有奇迹出现
You know, perhaps there is Something there
that wasn't there before

1006
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,507
什么？
What?

1007
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:28,916
也许就会有奇迹出现
There may be something there
that wasn't there before.

1008
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,852
什么啦，妈妈？
What's there, Mama?

1009
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,884
等你再大一点就知道了
I'll tell you when you're older.

1010
00:56:36,795 --> 00:56:38,387
你们都知道这诅咒
Right, then! You all know why we're here.

1011
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:41,954
我们有12个小时又36分15秒…
We have exactly 12 hours, 36 minutes and 15 seconds

1012
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,090
去创造最神奇的…
to create the most magical

1013
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:45,227
自发的，浪漫的爱情
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere

1014
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:48,863
美女爱上野兽
known to man or beast. "Or beast..."

1015
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:53,805
好吧
Right.

1016
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:58,975
你们都知道 最后一片花瓣凋谢时
Need I remind you
that if the last petal falls from this rose

1017
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,075
就永远不能解除魔法了
the spell will never be... broken!

1018
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:05,985
你们都知道自己的任务
Very well. You all know your assignments.

1019
00:57:06,057 --> 00:57:07,547
这一半往西
Half of you to the west wing.

1020
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,217
这一半往东
Half of you to the east wing.

1021
00:57:09,294 --> 00:57:11,023
其余的跟我来
The rest of you, come with me.

1022
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,067
轻松点，高士华
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth,

1023
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:19,898
自然就会有答案了
and let nature take its course.

1024
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:22,302
他们显然都被对方吸引
It's obvious there's a spark between them.

1025
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:27,140
我们可以稍微煽风点火
Yes, but there's no harm in fanning the flames.

1026
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:31,213
如果我们可再变回人类 他们得在今晚爱上对方
Besides, they must fall in love
tonight if we ever expect to be human again.

1027
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,142
再变回人类
Ah, human again.

1028
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:34,206
再变回人类
Human again.

1029
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,344
对，想想那会怎么样
Yes, think what that means.

1030
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:45,054
我将再度烹饪，再度恢复美貌
I'll be cooking again, Be good looking again

1031
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,529
当我再变回人类，双臂各拥美女
With a mademoiselle on each arm

1032
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:52,732
只有再变回人类，才能从容优雅
When I'm human again, Only human again

1033
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:56,534
焕发迷人的光彩
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm

1034
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,269
我又可以打扮时髦，殷勤追求爱人
I'll be courting again, Chic and sporting again

1035
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:04,074
丈夫们将提心吊胆
Which should cause several husbands alarm

1036
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,910
我将从橱子上眺望
I'll hop down off this shelf

1037
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,677
马上就变回人类
And tout de suite be myself

1038
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:11,016
我等不及要再变回人类
I can't wait to be human again

1039
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,589
当我们再变回人类，只要再变回人类
When we're human again, Only human again

1040
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,221
当我们不再是放在架上的摆饰
When we're knickknacks and whatnots no more

1041
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:23,664
当我们再变回人类，好好地再变回人类
When we're human again, good and human again

1042
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:27,261
-亲爱的 -一切都将变好
Oh, cherie, won't it all be top drawer?

1043
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,236
我将擦上红红的口红
I'll wear lipstick and rouge

1044
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,772
身材也不再如此肥大
And I won't be so huge

1045
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:34,333
是啊，我将能轻松穿过门扉
Why, I'll easily fit through that door

1046
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:38,380
我将变成精灵，我将披上礼服
I'll exude savoir faire, I'll wear gowns, 

1047
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:42,384
我会长出头发，我祈祷着再变回人
I'll have hair, It's my prayer to be human again

1048
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,023
当我们再变回人类，只要再变回人
When we're human again, Only human again

1049
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:53,494
再回到人类世界
When the world once more starts making sense

1050
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:56,794
我将放松发情，那可真怪了
I'll unwind, for a change, Really? That'd be strange

1051
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,233
你以为我喜欢上紧发条啊
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?

1052
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,598
我将待在海边的小屋，轻啜一口茶
In a shack by the sea, I'll sit back, sipping tea

1053
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,935
我要退休了
Let my early retirement commence

1054
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:11,740
我将远离蜡烛，我说到做到
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax!

1055
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:15,615
我将再变回人
When I'm human again

1056
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:19,351
把地上的灰尘扫去
So sweep the dust from the floor

1057
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:22,425
让光线照进房里
Let's let some light in the room

1058
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:29,591
我感觉得到也明白随时会有人来解除魔咒
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell any day now

1059
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,897
门边的铜器闪亮
Shine up the brass on the door

1060
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:35,870
畚箕扫帚都戒备
Alert the dust pail and broom

1061
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:43,242
如果一切顺利，很快就能解除魔咒
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand any day now

1062
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,680
打开百叶窗，让空气流通
Open the shutters, and let in some air

1063
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:50,651
这些摆在这儿，那些放那里
Put these here, and put those over there

1064
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:54,088
忘怀这数年，伤悲与泪水
Sweep up the years of sadness and tears

1065
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:55,715
全部都忘记
And throw them away

1066
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:07,765
当我们再变回人类，只要再变回人类
We'll be human again, Only human again

1067
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,035
当那女孩终于解放我们
When the girl finally sets us all free

1068
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:12,802
脸颊又显出欢愉
Cheeks a-blooming again

1069
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,442
我们恢复人生
We're assuming again

1070
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:18,114
我们将重拾欢乐生活
We'll resume our long lost joie de vivre

1071
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,480
我们祈祷
We'll be playing again, Holidaying again

1072
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,918
它能早降临
And we're praying it's ASAP

1073
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,251
稍微催促，一点压力
We will push, we will shove

1074
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,483
他们可能坠入爱河
They will both fall in love

1075
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:32,187
我们也将再变回人
And we'll finally be human again...

1076
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,163
这是最悲伤的故事
For never was a story of more woe

1077
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:40,032
罗蜜欧与茱丽叶
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

1078
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,229
可以再读一次吗？
Could you read it again?

1079
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,434
换你读好了
Well, here, why don't you read it to me?

1080
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:47,908
好吧…
Uh, all right. Uh...

1081
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,112
我不识字
Uh... I can't.

1082
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,040
你没学过？
You mean, you never learned?

1083
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:58,315
学过一点点
I learned... a little.

1084
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,152
太久没读了
It's just been so long.

1085
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:05,524
来，我帮你，从这里开始
Well, here, I'll help you. Let's start here. Here.

1086
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,159
-凉个？ -两个
Okay, "Twoe..."  "Two."

1087
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,064
两个，我学过
"Two... I knew that.

1088
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,070
两个家庭…
Two households..."

1089
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:19,666
我们将再度跳舞
We'll be dancing again

1090
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,267
再度旋转
We'll be twirling again

1091
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:24,814
我们将轻松跳舞
We'll be whirling around with such ease

1092
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:27,850
当我们再变回人类，只要再变回人类
When we're human again, Only human again

1093
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,580
我们可以随着，古老的华尔滋一二三
We'll go waltzing those old one, two, threes

1094
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,816
我们可以再度移动，再度滑行
We'll be floating again, We'll be gliding again

1095
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:38,452
昂首阔步而行
Stepping, striding as fine as you please

1096
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:41,827
像个真正的人一样
Like a real human does, 

1097
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:45,368
就跟以前一样
I'll be all that I was

1098
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:49,633
在灿烂的早晨，当我们终于重生时
On that glorious morn when we're finally reborn

1099
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:55,371
我们全都将再变回人
And we're all Human again!

1100
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,458
应该是今天晚上了
Tonight is the night.

1101
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,322
我想我做不到
I'm not sure I can do this.

1102
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:18,992
你没时间害怕了
You don't have time to be timid.

1103
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,297
大胆些，我亲爱的主人
You must be bold, daring.

1104
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:25,135
大胆些，亲爱的
Bold, daring.

1105
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,507
音乐及罗曼蒂克的烛光
There will be music... romantic candlelight...

1106
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,642
由我提供
provided by myself.

1107
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,182
当时机一到
And when the moment is right

1108
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:35,945
你就坦白地对她表示你的爱意
you confess your love.

1109
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,387
我…
Yes, I con...

1110
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,855
不，我不行…
I-I... No, I can't.

1111
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,424
你喜欢她，是不是？
You care for the girl, don't you?

1112
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,652
非常喜欢
More than anything.

1113
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,127
那你一定要告诉她
Well, then, you must tell her.

1114
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:52,263
你看起来好…好…
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...

1115
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:53,631
好蠢
Stupid.

1116
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,669
这不是我想说的那个字
Not quite the word I was looking for.

1117
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,173
也许上面再剪短一些
Perhaps a little more off the top?

1118
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,778
小姐在等了
Your lady awaits.

1119
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:33,872
古老的故事
Tale as old as time

1120
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,372
如梦似真
True as it can be

1121
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:43,312
如此深情
Barely even friends

1122
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,911
天上尽有
Then somebody bends

1123
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,150
世间少见
Unexpectedly

1124
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:54,427
些微的改变
Just a little change

1125
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,659
唯妙的改变
Small, to say the least

1126
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:00,999
忐忑不安
Both a little scared

1127
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,972
暧昧不明
Neither one prepared

1128
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,532
美女与野兽
Beauty and the Beast

1129
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:11,838
独一无二
Ever just the same

1130
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,447
无法想像
Ever a surprise

1131
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,383
未曾有过
Ever as before

1132
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,687
但却明明白白
Ever just as sure

1133
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:28,195
如初升的朝阳
As the sun will rise

1134
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,267
古老的故事
Tale as old as time

1135
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,705
如梦似幻
Tune as old as song

1136
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:42,343
各种滋味
Bittersweet and strange

1137
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:44,778
各自体会
Finding you can change

1138
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,509
出人意表
Learning you were wrong

1139
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,614
如初升的朝阳
Certain as the sun

1140
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,482
闪耀东方
Rising in the east

1141
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,960
古老的故事
Tale as old as time

1142
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,725
美丽的歌谣
Song as old as rhyme

1143
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:05,829
美女与野兽
Beauty and the Beast

1144
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:12,369
古老的故事
Tale as old as time

1145
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:16,468
美丽的歌谣
Song as old as rhyme

1146
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:22,610
美女与野兽
Beauty and the Beast.

1147
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,411
阿齐，你该睡觉了
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.

1148
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,514
回你的碗橱子里去吧
It's past your bedtime.

1149
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,416
晚安
Good night, love.

1150
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:56,916
贝儿
Belle?

1151
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:02,589
你在这里会觉得快乐吗？
Are you... happy here with me?

1152
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,317
当然
Yes.

1153
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,464
怎么了？
What is it?

1154
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,168
我好希望能再见到我爸爸
If only I could see my father again

1155
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,932
只要一眼，我好想念他
just for a moment. I miss him so much.

1156
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,604
我有办法
There is a way.

1157
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:32,444
这面镜子可以让你看到任何你想看到的事情
This mirror will show you anything...
anything you wish to see.

1158
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,819
我希望能看到我父亲
I'd like to see my father,

1159
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:35,880
好吗？
please.

1160
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:43,527
爸爸
Papa?

1161
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,261
不，他生病了
Oh, no. He's sick.

1162
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,359
他也许会死
He may be dying

1163
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:49,735
他那么孤单无助
and he's all alone.

1164
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,676
那…那你该回去照顾他
Then, you must go to him.

1165
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,005
你说…什么？
What did you say?

1166
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,941
你可以走了
I release you.

1167
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:04,519
你不再是我的犯人了
You are no longer my prisoner.

1168
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,215
你是说，我自由了
You mean... I'm free?

1169
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:09,353
是的
Yes.

1170
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:12,050
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

1171
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:13,322
爸爸，振作点
Hold on, Papa.

1172
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,761
我马上就回来了
I'm on my way.

1173
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,094
带着它吧
Take it with you

1174
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,830
这样你可以回忆一下这里
so you'll always have a way to look back

1175
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,436
希望你记得我
and remember me.

1176
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,902
谢谢你能谅解他对我的重要
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.

1177
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,446
主人
Well, Your Highness,

1178
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:43,788
这每一件事情都进行得很顺利
I must say everything is going just swimmingly.

1179
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,589
我知道你是绝对没有问题的
I knew you had it in you.

1180
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,322
我让她走了
I let her go.

1181
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,665
是的，是的，那太好了
Yes, yes. Splen...

1182
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:53,998
你…什么？
You what? 

1183
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,661
你怎么能这样做呢？
How could you do that?

1184
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,133
我不得不
I had to.

1185
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,232
但…但…为什么呢？
Yes, but... Why?

1186
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,876
因为我爱她
Because... I love her.

1187
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,572
他做了什么？
He did what?

1188
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,048
没错，他答应让她走了
Yes. I'm afraid it's true.

1189
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,744
她要走吗？
She's going away?

1190
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:11,844
就只差那么一点点了
But he was so close.

1191
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:13,786
不管怎么说
After all this time,

1192
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,415
他终于学会了怎么去爱人
he's finally learned to love.

1193
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:17,550
那咒语是不是
That's it, then.

1194
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,185
就应该解开了？
That should break the spell.

1195
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,762
还是没用的
But it's not enough.

1196
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,264
贝儿也得爱他才行啊
She has to love him in return.

1197
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,591
这一切都太迟了
Now it's too late.

1198
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:38,113
爸爸，爸爸
Papa! Papa!

1199
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:53,686
他们回来了
Ooh. They're back.

1200
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,455
贝儿
Belle?

1201
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,070
没事了，爸爸，我回来了
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

1202
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:06,200
我以为再也看不见你了
I thought I'd never see you again.

1203
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,072
我好想你啊
I missed you so much.

1204
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,008
那野兽
But the Beast?

1205
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:10,636
你怎么逃出来的？
Did you... how did you escape?

1206
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,647
我不是逃走的，爸爸
I didn't escape, Papa.

1207
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:13,713
他让我走的
He let me go.

1208
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,147
那只可怕的野兽？
That horrible beast?

1209
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,310
他现在不一样了，爸爸
But he's different now, Papa.

1210
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,854
他改变了好多哦
He's changed somehow.

1211
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,721
一个偷渡客啊
Oh. A stowaway.

1212
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,497
小家伙
Why, hello there, little fella.

1213
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,967
真没想到还能再看见你
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1214
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:36,631
贝儿，你为什么要走？
Belle, why'd you go away?

1215
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,799
你不喜欢我们了吗？
Don't you like us anymore?

1216
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:41,275
阿齐，我当然喜欢
Oh, Chip, of course I do.

1217
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,436
可是因为…
It's just...

1218
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,311
请问有事吗？
May I help you?

1219
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,010
我们是来接你父亲的
I've come to collect your father.

1220
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:50,109
我父亲？
My father?

1221
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,016
小姐，你别担心
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

1222
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:54,352
我们会好好照顾他的
We'll take good care of him.

1223
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:56,949
我父亲不是疯子
My father's not crazy.

1224
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,857
他像疯子一样胡说八道
He was raving like a lunatic.

1225
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,623
我们都听到了，对不对？
We all heard him, didn't we?

1226
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,023
不，我不准你们…
No, I won't let you.

1227
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:07,331
-贝儿 -莫维斯？
Belle? Maurice,

1228
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:08,893
老头子，你再说一遍
tell us again, old man.

1229
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,739
那个野兽有多大啊？
Just how big was the beast?

1230
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:16,167
它…它…很大
He was... I mean, he was... he was... enormous.

1231
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:17,974
大概有八英尺
I-I'd say at least eight...

1232
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:19,878
不…超过十英尺吧
No, more like ten feet.

1233
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:24,586
他不疯，那谁才是疯子啊？
Well, you don't get much crazier than that.

1234
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,156
是真的，真的
It's true, I tell you.

1235
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,782
把他带走
Get him out of here.

1236
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,156
放开我
Let go of me.

1237
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,086
不
No!

1238
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,220
你们不能这么做
You can't do this.

1239
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,330
可怜的贝儿
Poor Belle.

1240
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,026
你爸爸怎么会是个疯子啊
It's a shame about your father.

1241
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:40,034
你知道他没有疯的对不对
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1242
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,796
我倒是可以想想办法
Hmm, I might be able to clear up this...

1243
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:45,067
帮你澄清这个误会
little misunderstanding.

1244
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:46,802
-只要… -只要什么？
If... If what?

1245
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,740
只要你肯嫁给我
If you marry me.

1246
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,177
-什么？ -一个字，贝儿
What?  One little word, Belle.

1247
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,475
只要你肯说那一个字
That's all it takes.

1248
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,174
-休想  -随你便了
Never.  Have it your way.

1249
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:58,213
-贝儿  -放开我
Belle.  Let go of me.

1250
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:00,881
我可以证明我父亲不是疯子
My father's not crazy and I can prove it.

1251
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:02,380
让我看野兽
Show me the Beast.

1252
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:08,819
他会伤人吗？
Is it dangerous?

1253
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,230
不会的，他从来没有伤过人
Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

1254
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,063
我知道他样子长得很可怕
Please, I know he looks vicious,

1255
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:16,195
但是他很仁慈又绅士
but he's really kind and gentle.

1256
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,329
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

1257
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,396
如果我没猜错
If I didn't know better

1258
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,534
你看起来跟那个怪物好像很有感情啊
I'd think you had feelings for this monster.

1259
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,339
他不是怪物，加斯顿
He's no monster, Gaston.

1260
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,208
你才是
You are.

1261
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,314
我看这个女孩跟她爸爸一样疯了
She's as crazy as the old man.

1262
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:31,783
野兽会在夜里偷走你们的孩子
The Beast will make off with your children.
He'll come after them in the night.

1263
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,255
-不会  -只有杀了他才安全
No!  We're not safe
till his head is mounted on my wall.

1264
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,120
我建议我们杀了他
I say we kill the Beast!

1265
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:39,986
野兽不能让他活
We're not safe until he's dead

1266
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,586
晚上他会来害人
He'll come stalking us at night

1267
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,130
要是让他吃掉孩子
Set to sacrifice our children

1268
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,995
不如马上除掉他
To his monstrous appetite

1269
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,762
他在小城出现
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1270
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,734
就会扰乱我们的生活
If we let him wander free

1271
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:52,639
是我们该行动的时候
So it's time to take some action, boys

1272
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:57,668
请大家跟我来
It's time to follow me

1273
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:02,441
过沼泽，穿森林  走过黑暗，走过阴影
Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows

1274
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:05,453
一个恶梦但却令我兴奋
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride

1275
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:07,182
祈求天指引我
Say a prayer, then we're there

1276
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,985
过了吊桥就是城堡
at the drawbridge of a castle

1277
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:12,425
有个怪物一定要把他除掉
And there's something truly terrible inside

1278
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,052
是野兽，他可恶
It's a beast, he's got fangs, 

1279
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,391
危害人类
razor-sharp ones

1280
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:18,593
他残暴，凶猛，没人性
Massive paws, killer claws, for the feast

1281
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,566
他怒吼，他疯狂
Hear him roar, see him foam

1282
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,228
但我们一定要杀掉他
But we're not coming home 

1283
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:26,331
让他死，杀野兽
Till he's dead, Good and dead, Kill the Beast!

1284
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,036
不，我不准你们伤害他
No, I won't let you do this.

1285
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:30,477
假如你不跟我们一起 就是反对我们
If you're not with us, you're against us.

1286
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,013
把那个老头带来
Bring the old man.

1287
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:33,514
放开我
Get your hands off me.

1288
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,047
我们也不会让你去通知那个野兽
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1289
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,445
放我们出去
Let us out!

1290
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,783
现在要出发去抓那个野兽
We'll rid the village of this beast.

1291
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,288
谁愿意跟我一起去？
Who's with me?

1292
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:44,920
燃火把，快上马
Raise your torch, mount your horse

1293
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,619
带好武器勇敢向前冲
Screw your courage to the sticking place

1294
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,824
我们让加斯顿来作领导
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

1295
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,297
过沼泽，穿森林
Through the mist, through the wood

1296
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,891
走过黑暗阴影
Where, within a haunted castle

1297
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:55,961
有个怪物在那城堡
Something's lurking that you don't see every day

1298
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,299
他是像山一样高大的野兽
It's a beast, one as tall as a mountain

1299
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,773
不休息直到他倒下去
We won't rest till he's good and deceased

1300
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,506
走啊，冲啊
Sally forth, tally ho

1301
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,172
握紧你的剑，拿起你的弓
Grab your sword, grab your bow

1302
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,772
赞美主，我们出发
Praise the Lord, and here we go.

1303
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,511
我们要让城堡倒下
We'll lay siege to the castle

1304
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,246
带回他的头
and bring back his head!

1305
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:13,645
我一定要去通知野兽
I have to warn the Beast.

1306
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,315
都是我惹的祸
This is all my fault.

1307
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,086
爸爸，我们该怎么办？
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?

1308
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,491
不是的…
Now, now.

1309
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,355
我们要赶紧想办法
We'll think of something.

1310
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:34,372
我们不了解可怕的野兽而心生恐惧
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us And this monster
is mysterious at least

1311
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:35,842
拿起枪，拿起刀
Bring your guns, bring your knives

1312
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:37,503
拯救妇女小孩
Save your children and your wives

1313
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,673
恢复我们小城的可爱
We'll save our village and our lives

1314
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,080
杀死野兽
We'll kill the Beast!

1315
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:46,015
我们根本就不该抱太大希望的
I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.

1316
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,784
也许她从来没有出现过比较好
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1317
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:51,185
可能吗？
Could it be?

1318
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:52,022
是她吗？
Is it she?

1319
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:54,522
有人侵入
Sacre bleu! Invaders.

1320
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,756
有敌人
Encroachers.

1321
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,196
他们有魔镜
And they have the mirror.

1322
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,164
快去通知主人
Warn the master.

1323
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:00,259
要准备应战了
If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them.

1324
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,631
有谁跟我来？
Who's with me?

1325
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,168
你们可以拿任何你们想要的东西
Take whatever booty you can find

1326
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,437
但记住，那个野兽是我的
but remember, the Beast is mine!

1327
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:10,910
我们不怕任何困难危险
Lights ablaze, banners high, We go marching into battle

1328
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,709
坚持到底跟他们作战
Unafraid, although the danger just increased

1329
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,408
高举旗，大声唱
Raise the flag, sing the song

1330
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:20,012
我们五十个人 强壮有力一定会成功
Here we come, we're 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1331
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,181
杀死野兽
Let's kill the Beast!

1332
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,024
主人陛下
Pardon me, Master?

1333
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,354
不要烦我
Leave me in peace.

1334
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,929
但是有人攻打城堡啊
But, sir, the castle is under attack.

1335
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,093
杀野兽…杀野兽…
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1336
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:32,965
这样是不行的
This isn't working.

1337
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,036
卢米亚
Oh, Lumiere,

1338
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,535
我们快想办法啊
we must do something.

1339
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,532
等一等，有了
Wait, I know.

1340
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:42,010
杀野兽，杀野兽
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1341
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,205
我们怎么办？主人
What shall we do, Master?

1342
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,943
让他们来吧，我无所谓了
It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.

1343
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,281
杀野兽，杀野兽
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1344
01:14:51,387 --> 01:14:52,513
杀野兽
Kill the Beast!

1345
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:06,227
攻击
Now!

1346
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,382
好了
Yes!

1347
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:33,862
出发
Here we go.

1348
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,790
那是什么？
What the devil?

1349
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:40,958
贝儿，小心
Belle, look out!

1350
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:50,571
你们一定要试一试
You guys got to try this thing.

1351
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,086
看上面，人渣
Up here you scurvy scum! 

1352
01:15:58,154 --> 01:15:59,587
攻击
Now!

1353
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,657
滚出去
And stay out!

1354
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:42,486
站起来
Get up.

1355
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,487
站起来
Get up!

1356
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,653
怎么了你？野兽？
What's the matter, Beast?

1357
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,900
是不是太温柔太仁慈了？
Too kind and gentle to fight back?

1358
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:00,935
不
No!

1359
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:05,341
贝儿
Belle...

1360
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:06,676
不要，加斯顿
No! Gaston, 

1361
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,771
不要
don't!

1362
01:18:13,556 --> 01:18:15,046
费力，我们走
Let's go, Philippe.

1363
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,713
带种的出来啊
Come on out and fight!

1364
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,153
你爱上她了吗？野兽？
Were you in love with her, Beast?

1365
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,816
你有没有仔细想过
Did you honestly think she'd want you

1366
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,292
凭你那付德性她会看上你吗？
when she had someone like me?

1367
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,041
去死吧，野兽
It's over, Beast.

1368
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,802
贝儿是我的
Belle is mine!

1369
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:14,840
不要松手，不要松手
Let me go. Let me go.

1370
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,544
不要伤害我，求求你
Please, don't hurt me.

1371
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:19,417
任何事情我都答应你
I'll do anything. Anything!

1372
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,166
你滚吧
Get out.

1373
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:36,693
野兽
Beast!

1374
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:38,871
贝儿
Belle?

1375
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,047
贝儿
Belle?

1376
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,514
你回来了？
You came back.

1377
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:39,966
你回来了
You... You came back.

1378
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:42,162
是的，我回来了
Of course I came back.

1379
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:44,330
我不能让他们…
I couldn't let them...

1380
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,302
这都是我的错
Oh, this is all my fault.

1381
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,273
如果我能早点赶回来
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1382
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:51,780
也许这样比较好
Maybe... it's better...

1383
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,007
这样子比较好
it's better this way.

1384
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:55,379
不要这样说
Don't talk like that.

1385
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:56,815
你不会有事的
You'll be all right.

1386
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,113
我们又在一起了
We're together now.

1387
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,213
什么都会好的，对吗？
Everything's going to be fine. You'll see.

1388
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,016
至…至少
And... at least...

1389
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:10,531
我还能看你最后一眼
I got to see you... one last time.

1390
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,470
不…不要…
No. No.

1391
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,707
求求你…
Please... Please...

1392
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:28,749
不要丢下我
Please, don't leave me.

1393
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,654
