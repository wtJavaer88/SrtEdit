00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,260
在草地上
On the meadow?

169
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,470
说不定
Perhaps.

170
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,640
安静.
Hush now.

171
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,060
我们就快要到了
We're almost there.

172
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,620
- 草地!  - 等等
- The meadow.  - Wait.

173
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,790
斑比 等等
Bambi, wait.

174
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,780
千万不可以在草地上乱跑
You must never rush out on the meadow.

175
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,000
这样会有危险的
There might be danger.

176
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,170
在草地上我们得不到保护
Out there, we're unprotected.

177
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,330
草地非常的宽广
The meadow is wide and open,

178
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,340
没有树 还有丛森来隐藏
and there are no trees or bushes to hide us.

179
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,760
所以我们要非常的小心
So we have to be very careful.

180
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,840
你在这里等我
Wait here.

181
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,200
我先走出去
I'll go out first.

182
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,950
假如草地很安全我就通知你
And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.

183
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,240
斑比 可以出来了
Come on, Bambi.

184
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,780
不要怕啊
It's all right

185
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,450
快出来啊
Come on.

186
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,920
早啊 斑比王子
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

187
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,260

Good morning, young prince.

188
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,300

189
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,950
木树
Clover.

190
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,930
很像很好吃喔
It's awfully good.

191
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,560
美味可口喔
It's delicious.

192
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,810
你也吃吃看吧?
Why don't you try some?

193
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,730
不对! 不对 斑比
No, not that green stuff.

194
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,530
不那个东西 是花果
Just eat the blossoms.

195
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,240
只吃花果 它是最美味的东西
That's the good stuff.

196
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,820
桑普!
Thumper!

197
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,950
什么事 妈妈?
Yes, Mama?

198
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,200
你爸爸是怎么告诉你的?
What did your father tell you?

199
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,370
有关于什么?
About what?

200
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,920
关于吃花果留下绿叶的故事啊
About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?

201
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,800
原来是那个啊
Oh, that one.

202
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,260
吃绿叶是特别的糟蹋
Eating greens is a special treat.

203
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,530
会长出长耳朵和大脚
It makes long ears and great big feet.

204
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,770
不过绿叶的味道真的很难吃
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

205
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,980
最后一句话是我自己编的
I made that last part up myself.

206
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,360
小心喔 小心
Watch out.

207
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,550
她是小芬妮
That's little Faline.

208
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,930
妈妈 它会不好意思喔
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

209
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,600
如果你跟他打声招呼就不会了
Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello.

210
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,320
你好 斑比
Hello, Bambi.

211
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,860
你好啊
I said hello.

212
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
斑比 赶快回答她啊
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

213
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,910
你应该不会害怕 对不对?
You're not afraid, are you?

214
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,790
赶快上前去啊
Well, then, go ahead.

215
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,890
快说啊 快说你好!
Go on, say hello.

216
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,770
你好
Hello.

217
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,090
他停下来看着我
He stopped and looked at me.

218
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,100
是啊 我知道
Yes, I know.

219
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,340
为什么它在草地上出现 大家都不动呢?
Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?

220
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,000
因为大家都很尊敬他
Everyone respects him.

221
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,910
森林里所有的鹿
For of all the deer in the forest,

222
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,400
没有一只活得比他还要长久的
not one has lived half so long.

223
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,940
他既勇敢 又很贤能
He's very brave and very wise.

224
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,980
所以他是大家公认的森林大王子
That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest.

225
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,230
小玲
Faline.

226
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,310
斑比

227
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,690
妈妈
Mother.

228
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,950
斑比
Bambi.

229
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,370
妈
Mother.

230
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,120

232
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,160
斑比 可以出来了

It's safe now.

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,340
已经不必躲藏了
We don't have to hide any longer.

236
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,390
妈到底发生什么事了?
What happened, Mother?

237
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,600
为什么我们要躲呢?
Why did we all run?

238
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,310
这是因为... 人类来到了森林
Man... was in the forest.

239
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,460
妈 快看
Mother, look.

240
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,120
外面那是什么?
What's all that white stuff?

241
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,090
啊 那是雪
Why, it's snow.

242
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,330
- 雪?  - 是的
- Snow?  - Yes.

243
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,180

你看 它已经凝固了
Look.The water's stiff.

起来嘛 像我这个样子
Come on, get up. Like this.

251
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,040
你会摇摇晃晃的 对不对呀? 斑比
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

252
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,660
你不能光看前脚 也要注意后脚嘛
Got to watch both ends at the same time.

253
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,490
我想你的脚不打结会比较好看
Guess you better unwind it.

254
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,590
起床了!
Wake up.

Hibernating?

对呀

261
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,740
那你为什么要冬眠呢?
What do you want to do that for?

262
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:05,290
就是我可以长时间的睡觉嘛
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

晚安了 两位
Well, good night.

264
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,120
冬天很漫长是不是 妈妈?

265
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
感觉上很漫长
It seems long.

266

可是它不会永远持续下去的
But it won't last forever.

I'm awful hungry, Mother.

# Get into the mood And be merry today #

305
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,910

327
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,940
来换取一对鹿角 对不对啊?
traded in your spots for a pair of antlers.

328
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,400
你不知道啊?
You know,

329
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:35,610
前天啊 我还自己在想呢
just the other day I was talking to myself about you.

330
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,660
我们不知道你变成什么样子了
And we were wondering what had become of you.

331
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,910
你好 斑比
Hello, Bambi.

332
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,700
还记得我吗?
Remember me?

333
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,290
是桑普.
Thumper.

334
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,580
答对了
Right.

335
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,850
各位
Hi, fellas.

336
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,840
花
Flower.

337
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,430
对喔
Yeah.

338
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,210
他们是怎么搞的?
Well, what's the matter with them?

339
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,360
怎么会有那种动作 好奇怪喔
Why are they acting that way?

340
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:20,660
你们不知道吗? 他们恋爱了
Why, don't you know? They're "twitterpated."

341
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,740
恋爱了?
Twitterpated?

342
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,660
没错 到了春天了大家都这样的
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time.

343
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,720
举个例
For example,

344
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,090
你一个人走着在想心事
you're walking along, minding your own business,

345
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,260
你既不看左呢 也不看右
you're looking neither to the left nor to the right,

346
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:49,350
突然间 你撞见一个漂亮的脸孔
when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face.

347
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,360
两腿开始发软
You begin to get weak in the knees.

348
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,530
然后 头昏眼花的
Your head's in a whirl.

349
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,910
接着呢 你就感觉魂飞出去一样 轻飘飘的
And then you feel light as a feather.

350
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,160
还没弄清楚呢!
And before you know it,

351
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,960
原来你是在空中漫步
you're walking on air.

352
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,500
然后呢 你知道吗?
And then you know what?

353
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,630
你会在空中 像这样的旋转
You're knocked for a loop.

354
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,860
整天的失去理智了
And you completely lose your head.

355
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,970
真可怕
Gosh, that's awful.

356
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,060
- 就是嘛  - 十分可怕
- Gee whiz.  -Terrible.

357
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,660
不光是这样
And that ain't all.

358
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,440
任何的动物都会碰上的
It can happen to anybody.

359
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,230
劝你们要小心一点喔
So you'd better be careful.

360
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,480
会让你们碰上的
It could happen to you, .

361
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,320
还有你
and you,

362
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,610
还有你
and...

363
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,830
你也会碰上的
Yes, it could even happen to you.

364
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,210
不会发生在我身上 我敢保证
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

365
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,080
我也不
Me neither.

366
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,290
我也不
Me neither

367
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,110
恋爱

# In the hope that you'll see #

380
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,160
# When you're looking at me #

# That I'm looking for love #

382
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,660
# I'm seeking that glow #

383
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,540
# Only found when you're young and it's May #

384
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,670
# Only found on that wonderful day #

385
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,800
# When all longing is through #

386
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,090
# I'm seeking that glow #

387
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,350
# Only found when a thrill is complete #

388
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,730
# Only found when two hearts gently beat #

389
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:48,320
# To the strains of a waltz That's both tender and new #

390
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:52,190
# I bring you a song #

391
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,950
# For I'm seeking romance #

392
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,910
# You're by my side There's a moon up above #

393
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,040
# It shines with a light That's so mellow and bright #

394
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,920
# It's easy to see That tonight we shall fall in love #

395
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,970
# I bring you a song #

396
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,810

# Love is a song #

# That never ends #

447
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,900
# One simple theme #

448
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:08,410
# Repeating #

449
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,990
# Like the voice #

450
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,620
# Of a heavenly choir #

451
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,420
# Love's sweet music #

452
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:42,860
