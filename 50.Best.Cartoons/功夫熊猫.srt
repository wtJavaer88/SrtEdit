功夫熊猫

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,130
传说有个传奇武士
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,360
他的功夫出神入化
...whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.

5
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,070
他走遍天涯 独孤求败
He traveled the land in search of worthy foes.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,620
你看你挺喜欢吃啊 也许该尝尝我的拳头
I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!

7
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,220
武士一言不发 因为正忙着吃
The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full.

8
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,460
然后一口吞下 开口道
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

9
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,830
"别废话 动手吧!"
Enough talk. Let's fight!

10
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,330
Shashabooey! Shashabooey!
我杀

11
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,140
他的招式如此致命
He was so deadly in fact

12
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,900
他的敌人瞠目结舌
that his enemies would go blind from overeXposure to pure awesomeness.

13
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,170
- 我的眼睛! - 他太彪悍了!
- My eyes! - He's too awesome!

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,010
- 太有才了! - 我们何以回报
- And attractive. - How can we repay you?

15
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,250
彪悍不求回报
There is no charge for awesomeness.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,950
迷人更无所需
Or attractiveness.

17
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,280
Kablooey! Kablooey!

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,090
他征战无数
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,030
无人堪与匹敌
They were no match for his bodacity!

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,210
从没有哪只熊猫能让人如此恐惧 又让人如此爱戴
Never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,780
即使是中国最英勇的勇士们
Even the most heroic heroes in China

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,080
"盛怒五杰"
the Furious Five

23
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,090
也尊敬地跪拜于这位大师
bowed in respect to this great master.

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,990
我们一起混吧
We should hang out.

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,180
批准
Agreed.

26
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,190
但出去玩的事情得先放一边
But hanging out would have to wait.

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,700
因为尚有万千暴徒待铲除
Because when you're facing the 10000 demons of Demon Mountain

28
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,570
正经事只有一件 就是...
there's only one thing that matters and that's...

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
阿波 起床!
Po! Get up!

30
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,240

猴哥 螳O 鹤儿 小蛇 虎妞
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

36
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,520
阿波 快点 都误了生意了
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

37
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,950
来啦...

38
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,490
对不起 老爸
Sorry   Dad.

39
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,400
对不起可变不出面条来
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

40
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,840
你在楼上搞什么名堂 稀里哗啦的
What were you doing up there? All that noise.

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,400
没什么 就是个乱七八糟的梦
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,700
什么梦?
About what?

43
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,370
梦到什么了?
What were you dreaming about?

44
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,970
梦到了...我梦见了...
What was I...?

45
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,810
我梦见了...
I was dreaming about...

46
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,840
...面条
...noodles.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,980
面条?你真梦见面条了?
Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?

48
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,620
没错 不然还能梦见啥?
Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?

49
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,160
小心 汤很烫
Careful! That soup is sharp.

50
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,700
哦 太让人高兴了
Oh   happy day!

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,670
我儿子终于做了个面条梦了
My son   finally having the noodle dream!

52
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,060
哦 你不知道 我等这一刻都等了多久
You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.

53
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,000
这是个好兆头 阿波
This is a sign   Po.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,870
什么好兆头
A sign of what?

55
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,570
我终于可以把我的秘之又秘
You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient

56
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,910
私酿密汤的配方传给你了
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

57
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,120
这样你就完成使命 继承这间饭馆了
Then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!

58
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,680
就像我子承父业 父承爷业一样
As I took it over from my father who took it over from his father...

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,420
这店可是爷爷和朋友打麻将赢来的
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,190
老爸 老爸 这不过是场梦
Dad   Dad   Dad   it was just a dream.

61
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,560
不 这是注定的梦
No   it was the dream.

62
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,200
我们是面条世家 流淌着面条的血脉
We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.

63
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,170
可是 老爸 你有没有...想过做点别的
But   Dad   didn't you ever want to do something else?

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,110
除了面条之外的
Something besides noodles?

65
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,110
其实 我还是个愤青的时候
Actually   when I was young and crazy

66
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,240
曾想过 离家出走 学做豆腐
I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
你为什么不做?
Why didn't you?

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,280
因为这是个愚蠢的梦
Because it was a stupid dream.

69
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,490
你能想象我做豆腐的样子吗?
Can you imagine me making tofu?

70
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,990
豆腐?
Tofu.

71
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,460
别提了!我们各有其命
No! We all have our place in this world.

72
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,090
我就是面条命 而你…
Mine is here   and yours is...

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,390
我知道了 也是面条命

74
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,600
错! 2号桌5号桌7号桌还有12号桌
No   it's at tables 2   5   7   and 12

75
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,730
微笑服务哦
Service with a smile.

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,340
干得漂亮 徒弟们 可别让我失望
Well done   students... if you were trying to disappoint me.

77
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,570
阿虎 力道要更强 皮猴 速度要更快
Tigress   you need more ferocity! Monkey   greater speed.

78
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,540
鹤儿 更高 小蛇 细腻 螳O...
Crane   height. Viper   subtlety. Mantis...

79
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,440
- 师傅 - 插什么嘴
- Master Shifu. - What?!

80
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,950
乌龟大师 他想见您
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

81
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,300
乌龟大师 您召见我 是出什么事了吗?
Master Oogway   you summoned me? Is something wrong?

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,070
为何非要出事 才能与老友相聚呢?
Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?

83
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,270
这么说 没出啥事?
So   nothing's wrong?

84
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,970
我倒也没这么说
Well   I didn't say that.

85
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,690
您是说...
You were saying?

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,860
我有个预感
I have had a vision.

87
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,670
太O会重现江湖
Tai Lung will return.

88
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,170
这不可能 他还在牢里呢
That is impossible! He is in prison.

89
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,010
一切皆有可能
Nothing is impossible.

90
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,870
小曾
Zeng!

91
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,280
马上飞到桃岗天牢去告诉他们
Fly to Ohorh-Gom prison and tell them

92
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,690
看守加倍 兵器加倍 什么都加倍
to double the guards   double their weapons   double everything!

93
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,660
确保太郎不会越狱
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

94
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,190
遵命! 师傅大师
Yes   Master Shifu!

95
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,190
越是想避免就越是逃不掉，反倒促成了它的来临
One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.

96
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,260
我们一定要采取行动 我不能让他来山谷胡作非为
We must do something! We can't let him march on the valley   take his revenge!

97
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,330
他会
He'll...

98
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,700
你心如此水 老朋友
Your mind is like this water my friend.

99
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,210
乱则不明
When it is agitated it becomes difficult to see.

100
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,380
但若心如止水
But if you allow it to settle...

101
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,440
...答案便尽现眼前
...the answer becomes clear.

102
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,550

是时候了
It is time.

104
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,790
可传给谁? 谁值得信任 能把这无限的力量交付与他
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?

105
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,600
让他成为"龙武士"
To become the Dragon Warrior?

106
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,140
我不知道
I don't know.

107
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,900
借过 抱歉
EXcuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

To the Jade Palace.

整个山谷的居民都会去 你就可以大卖特卖了
The whole valley will be there and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

120
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,810

Selling noodles?

121
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,920
可是 老爸 我在想我可不可以...

小蛇 鹤儿 皮猴 螳O
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

153
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,310
"盛怒五杰"
The Furious Five!

154
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,560
是 盛怒五杰!
Yeah   the Furious Five!

155
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,190
武士们准备

156
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,830
等等 不 噢 偷窥孔
Wait. No. Oh   peeky-hole.

157

- 准备比武 - 太好了
- Ready for battle! - Yeah.

158
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
数千火舌
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

159
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,730
哇噢 看看那个
Look at that.

160
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,800
嗨 别挡着我!
Hey! Get out of the way!

161
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,350
最后出场的是 虎妞大师
And finally Master Tigress!

162
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,190
相信我 居民们 你们还没看到过这么棒的呢
And believe me   citizens， you have not seen anything yet.

163
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,520

虎妞上场 空手入白刃

我感觉到"龙武士"就在我们中间
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

166
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,710
平和谷的居民们
Oitizens of the Valley of Peace

167
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,310
乌龟大师现在要选"龙战士"了
Master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!

168
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,450
什么? 不不 等等

169
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,220
有了
Yeah.

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,770
阿波
Po!

171
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,780
你在干什么?
What are you doing?!

172
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,410
你说我在干什么 别动
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

173
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,420
我要去看"龙武士"
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

174
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,850
可我不懂 你才做了面条梦啊
But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!

175
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,750
我骗你的  我没梦见面条，老爸
I lied. I don't dream about noodles   Dad.

176
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,100
我爱功夫
I love kung fu!

177
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,120
算了吧 儿子 还是做生意吧
Come on   son. Let's get back to work.

178
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,120
好吧
OK.

179
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,960
回来!
Come back!

180
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,990
怎么回事
What's going on?

181
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,420
我在哪
Where...?

182
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,490
你在指什么
What are you pointing...?

183
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,230
哦 对不起
OK. Sorry.

184
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,770
我只是想看看谁才是"龙武士"
I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.

185
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,770
真有意思啊
How interesting.

186
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,140
大师 您是指我吗?
Master   are you pointing at me?

187
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,240
- 他 - 谁?
- Him. - Who?

188
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,440
- 你 - 我?
- You. - Me?

189
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,010
上苍降"龙武士"予我们
The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!

190
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,690
- 什么? - 什么?!
- What? - What?!

191
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,450
- 什么?! - 什么?!
- What?! - What?!

192
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,930
停下! 等等! 谁叫你们去的!
Stop   wait! Who told you to...?

193
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,950
乌龟大师 等等
Master Oogway   wait.

194
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,280
那只肥熊猫不可能是盟主
That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.

195
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,050
你正要指虎妞的时候 那只破熊猫从天而降
You were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!

196
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,560
这只是个意外!
That was just an accident!

197
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,390
世上无意外
There are no accidents.

198
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,280
请您原谅 师傅 我们让您失望了
Forgive us   Master. We have failed you.

199
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,680
不 如果明天那熊猫还没打退堂鼓
No. If the panda has not quit by morning

200
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,080
那是我让你们失望了
then I will have failed you.

201
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,100
等等! 我是来送信的
Wait! Wait   wait   wait! I bring a message...

202
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,440
替师傅大师
...from Master Shifu.

203
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,270
什么?!
What?!

204
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,680
守卫加倍
"Double the guard?!"

205
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,550
额外警戒
"Extra precautions?!"

206
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,950
你的天牢不够严密
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

207
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,520
你怀疑我天牢的安全?!
You doubt my prison security?!

208
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,460
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

209
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,660
师傅说的 我只是个传话的
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

210
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,360
那么请你代我传个话给师傅
I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,130
从桃岗天牢越狱绝不可能!
Escape from Ohorh-Gom prison is impossible!

212
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,310
叹为观止吧?
Lmpressive   isn't it?

213
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,080
是 是 叹为观止
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,640
相当的叹为观止
It's very impressive.

215
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,380
进道出路 只有一条
One way in   one way out.

216
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,550
千名守卫 只守一个囚犯
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

217
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,150
是啊，只是那个囚犯是...
Yes，   except that prisoner...

218
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,920
太郎
...is Tai Lung.

219
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,730
送我们下去
Take us down.

220
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,610
你要干什么
What are you doing?

221
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,420
噢 天哪
Oh   my.

222
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,750
关着太郎
Behold Tai Lung.

223
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,490
我...我还是待在这儿吧
I'm just gonna wait right here.

224
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,870
没什么好担心的 非常安全
It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.

225
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,200
弓箭准备
Orossbows! At the ready!

226
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,070
弓箭
Orossbows?

227
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,700
嗨 牛人 你听说了吗?
Hey   tough guy   did you hear?

228
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,270
乌龟要把卷轴传给别人了 不是你
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll   and it's not gonna be you.

229
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,010
别把他惹恼了
Don't get him mad.

230
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,890
他又能怎么着 我已经把他捆结实了
What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.

231
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,090
我刚是不是踩到小猫咪的尾巴了
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,000
我好了 我看够了
I'm good. I've seen enough.

233
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,470
我会告诉师傅没啥担心的
I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.

234
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,760
当然不用担心
No   he doesn't.

235
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,070
我会告诉他的
I'll tell him that.

236
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,010
咱们能走了吗?
Can we please go now?

237
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,490
龙武士 龙武士
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,020
龙武士 龙武士
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

239
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,170
等一下
Wait a second!

240
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,840
我想这是个小误会 大家都以为我是...
I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm...

241
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,110
武士圣殿 不会吧
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

242
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
瞧瞧这地方
Look at this place.

243
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,130
飞行犀牛大师的盔甲 还有战斗留下的痕迹!
Master Flying Rhino's armor with authentic battle damage!

244
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,060
英雄之剑!
The Sword of Heroes!

245
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,400
听说锋利的看一眼都会被割伤...嗷
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking.

246
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,130
隐形的命运之杖!
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

247
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,970
我只见过这画的盗版
I've only seen paintings of that painting.

248
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,810
不会吧
No!

249
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,920
传说中的武士窃语之瓮
The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.

250
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,150
据说里面有整个天书军的灵魂
Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army.

251
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,650
你好
Hello.

252
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,060
你观光完毕了吗?
Have you finished sight-seeing?

253
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,220
对不起 我该先来看你
Sorry   I should have come to you first.

254
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,270
我的耐心有限
My patience is wearing thin.

255
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,170
不过 看起来你也没法去哪儿
Well   I mean   it's not like you were going anywhere.

256
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,610
- 你能转过身来吗? - 当然
- Would you turn around? - Sure.

257
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,700
嗨 这样怎么样
How's it going?

258
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,210
你是怎么让五千... 师傅大师
How do you get 5  000... Master Shifu!

259
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,580
有人把这个打碎了
Someone... broke that.

260
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,020
但我会补好的 你有没有...
But I'll fiX it. Do you have some...

261
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,180
...胶水?
...glue?

262
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,180
一块碎片
A splinter.

263
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,250
你就是那个传说中的"龙武士"?
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

264
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,460
- 我想是吧 - 错
- I guess so. - Wrong!

265
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,260
你不是也不可能是龙武士 除非
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until...

266
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,270
你学会了那龙轴里的秘密
...you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.

267
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,910
那我怎么上去呢
So   how does this work?

268
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,880
你有梯子或者蹦床或者
Do you have a ladder or a trampoline   or...?

269
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,240
你想的太简单了 我会把那无限力量的秘密
You think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret

270
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,220
- 就这么交给你? - 不 我...
- to limitless power? - No   I...

271
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,310
这个人必须先达到功夫的最高境界
One must first master the highest level of kung fu.

272
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,450
而像你这样的某人是不可能了
And that is impossible if that one is someone like you.

273
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,550
像我这样？
Someone like me?

274
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,290
是的 你瞧瞧 这肥屁股 松弛的臂
Yes   look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms!

275
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,830
啊 这些赘肉很敏感的呢
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

276
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,730
还有这荒唐的大肚皮
And this ridiculous belly.

277
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,070
还有 不讲个人卫生
And utter disregard for personal hygiene.

278
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,300
嘿 等等，积点口德
Now   wait a minute. That's uncalled for.

279
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,900
别站这么近 我闻到你口臭了
Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.

280
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,880
听着 乌龟大师说我是....
Listen   Oogway said I was...

281
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,610
啊 巫师指 别用巫师指
The WuXi Finger Hold. Not the WuXi Finger Hold!

282
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,410
哦 你知道这个指法
Oh   you know this hold?

283
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,150
第三王朝时 巫师大师发明的
Developed by Master WuXi in the Third Dynasty.

284
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,990
那你知道 当我弯下小指会发生什么吗
Then you know what happens when I flex my pinky.

285
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,520
- 不 不要 - 你知道最难办的是什么吗?
- No   no! - You know the hardest part of this?

286
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,460
最难的就是清理你的尸骨
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.

287
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,660
好吧 好吧 不要激动
OK   OK   take it easy.

288
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,170
那仔细听着 熊猫
Now listen closely   panda.

289
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,370
乌龟也许选了你 可当我找上你
Oogway may have picked you but when I'm through with you

290
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,340
我向你保证 你会希望 他选的不是你! 清楚了吗
I promise you   you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?

291
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,640
是 清楚了 太清楚了
Yeah   we're clear. We're so clear.

292
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,450
很好 呵呵
Good.

293
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,450
我等不及开始了
I can't wait to get started.

294
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,320
- 我们开始吧 - 等等
- Let's begin. - Wait   wait   wait.

295
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,930
什么?
What?

296
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,970
- 现在? - 是的 现在!
- Now? - Yes   now.

297
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,330
除非你认为乌龟大师错了 而你也不是"龙武士"
Unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

298
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,960
好吧
Oh   OK   well...

299
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,030
我不知道我是否.. 能把那些招式都做出来
I don't know if I can do all of those moves.

300
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,870
如果不试试 又怎么能知道呢
Well   if we don't try we'll never know   will we?

301
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,780
是啊 也许我们可以找更合适我这个水平的开始
Yeah   it's just   maybe we can find something more suited to my level.

302
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,910
那你是什么水平?
What level is that?

303
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,440
你知道...我不是大师
Well   I'm not a master   but...

304
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,290
不如从零级开始 零级
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

305
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,450
不 从来没有零级的说法
No. There is no such thing as level zero.

306
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,290
- 嘿 也许我可以从那开始 - 那个?
- Maybe I can start with that. - That?

307
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,460
我们用这训练孩子 天热的时候还用来顶着门
We use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.

308
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,870
可要是你坚持的话
But if you insist...

309
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,700
喔 是"盛怒五杰"!
The Furious Five!

310
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,040
你们可比功夫公仔大多了 除了你 螳螂 你还是那么大
You're bigger than your action figures. EXcept   you   Mantis. You're the same.

311
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,880
开始吧 熊猫 让我们看看你的能耐
Go ahead   panda. Show us what you can do.

312
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,120
你们就在这看我打? 还是我应该等你们都回去再开始...
Are they gonna watch   or should I wait till they get back to work?

313
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,180
出招
Hit it.

314
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,920
好吧 我才刚吃完东西 所以还在消化
OK   yeah. I mean   I just ate. So I'm still digesting.

315
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,760
所以我的功夫可能不像晚些那么好
So my kung fu might not be as good as... later on.

316
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,960
快出招!
Just hit it.

317
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,930
好吧
All right.

318
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,300
你算老几啊?你算个屁 有我在这儿
What you got? You got nothing 'cause I got it right here.

319
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,400
你找我朋友的茬? 等着找死吧
You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder.

320
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,670
看我佛山无影脚 你没辙了吧?
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

321
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,740
我移型幻影 你看不见 看不见
Come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.

322
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,610
你就知道螳臂
You've only seen praying mantis.

323
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,620
猴拳
Or monkey style.

324
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,620
金蛇狂舞袭击你
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

325
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,060
你能出招吗?!
Would you hit it!

326
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,290
好吧 好吧
All right. All right.

327
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,090
再来一次 重点打
Why don't you try again? A little harder.

328
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,100
怎样...啊
How's that?

329
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,370
疼死我了!
That hurts.

330
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,550
这比我想得可简单多了
This will be easier than I thought.

331
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,120
我感到有点想吐
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

332
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,260
他们太硬了
Those are hard!

333
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,070
我的鸡鸡
My tenders.

334
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,860
我表现如何
How did I do?

335
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,730
现在有零级了
There is now a level zero.

336
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,200
- 无语了 - 别不承认
- There's no words. - No denying that.

337
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,610
乌龟大师怎么想的啊?
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,970
那可怜的孩子 根本就是来送死的
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,540
他太"无敌"了!
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,450
"龙武士"从天而降坐在火球上
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,350
举手投足 地动山摇!
When he walks   the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,620
本以为乌龟大师会选一个会功夫的
One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,720
是啊  或是至少能摸到脚趾头的
Yeah   or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,200
或者至少能看到自己的脚趾吧
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,720
好吧
OK.

346
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,160
很好
Great.

347
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,610
嗨 你还没睡啊
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,080
现在醒了
I am now.

349
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,650
我只是
I was just...

350
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,620
不简单的一天哈
Some day   huh?

351
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,090
功夫可够累人的哈 你二头肌酸不?
That kung fu stuff is hard work   right? Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,930
今天已经是又长又失望的一天了 所以
I've had a long and rather disappointing day   so...

353
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,000
我差不多也该睡觉了
Yeah   I should probably get to sleep now.

354
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,540
- 是是 当然 - 谢谢
- Yeah   yeah   yeah. Of course. - OK   thanks.

355
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,440
只是 我可是你们的超级粉丝
It's just... Man   I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,210
卫平河战役 你们表现得太厉害了
You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,770
敌人千倍于你们 你们毫无退意 你们只是
Outnumbered a thousand to one but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,880
哦 不好意思哦
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,440
听着 你不属于这儿
Look   you don't belong here.

360
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,060
呃 我知道 你没错
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,620
我没有... 我只是...
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,220
我一生都梦想...
My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,170
不 我指你不属于"这儿" 我指这个房间 这是我的房间
No   I meant you don't belong here. I mean   in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,600
仙鹤的地盘
Property of Crane.

365
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,540
哦 好的 确实 确实
OK. Right   right.

366
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,130
那么...你想睡觉了?
So   you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,010
- 是的 - 我妨碍你了
- Yeah. - I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,210
明天还有要事呢
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,480
好吧 你很彪悍! 我就说这么多 拜拜
All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,480
你刚说什么?
What was that?

371
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,990
我什么都没说
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,220
好的 晚安
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,490
好梦!
Sleep well.

374
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,160
貌似有点尴尬
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,630
虎妞大师! 没想吵醒你
Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,400
- 你不属于这里! - 是 当然
- You don't belong here. - Yeah   of course.

377
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,770
这是你的房间
This is your room.

378
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,140
我的意思是 你不属于翡翠宫
I mean   you don't belong in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,580
你让功夫蒙羞
You're a disgrace to kung fu and if you have

380
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,280
如果你尊重我们
any respect for who we are and what we do

381
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,780
明早 你就该走
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,850
超级粉丝哦
Big fan!

383
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,100
看来你找到了神秘的天堂智慧桃树啊
I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,140
这就是那棵树? 抱歉我以为它就是棵普通桃树
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,150
我理解 你不开心的时候就会狂吃东西
I understand. You eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,210
不开心? 我没不开心啊 什么让你认为我不开心了?
Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,890
那你为什么不开心呢?
so why are you upset?

388
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,560
我可能是功夫史上最烂的
I probably sucked more than anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,260
中国史上最烂的 烂人史上也是最烂的!
In the history of China. In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,430
可能吧
Probably.

391
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,200
看看"盛怒五杰"! 你该看看 他们对我恨之入骨啊!
And the Five! Man   you should've seen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,270
没错
Totally.

393
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,410
师傅怎么可能把我变成"龙武士"啊?
How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,450
我一点也不像"五杰"
I mean   I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,080
我没爪子 没翅膀 也没毒牙
I've got no claws   no wings   no venom.

396
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,090
就连螳O 也有这些...玩意儿
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,100
唉 也许我就该一走了之 回家煮面
Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,430
走? 不走!
Quit   don't quit.

399
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,530
面条? 不要面条!
Noodles   don't noodles.

400
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,270
你太在意过去是怎样 将来会怎样了
You are too concerned with what was and what will be.

401
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,210
有句谚语说得好
There's a saying:

402
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,710
昨天已是历史
Yesterday is history

403
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,250
明天还很神秘
tomorrow is a mystery

404
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,410
但是今天是一个现金
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,290
这就是为什么要把它叫做现今
That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,650
- 噢 不会吧 - 发生什么了?
- Oh   no! - What's happening?!

407
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,220
去你的战斗位置 快 快
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,600
巨箭开火!
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,000
开火!
Fire!

410
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,670
开火!
Fire!

411
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,010
太郎越狱了! 我必须去警告师傅
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,920
- 你哪儿都别去! 他也是! - 放开我
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he! - Let go of me!

413
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,110
把它拉起来
Bring it up!

414
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,350
等一下 把它放回去
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,140
- 他朝这来了 - 他过不来的 弓箭手
- He's coming this way! - He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,120
我们死翘翘了 死得很翘很翘了!
We're dead. So very   very dead.

417
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,880
还没呢 我们还没! 现在!
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,270
- 现在能跑了么 - 是的
- Can we run now? - Yes.

419
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,530
我很高兴师傅派你来
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,630
我还以为都把我忘了呢
I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,730
飞回去跟他们说
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,530
真正的"龙武士"要回家了
...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

423
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,040
早上好 大师
Good morning   Master!

424
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,150
熊猫!
Panda!

425
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,210
熊猫!
Panda!

426
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,790
起床!
Wake up!

427
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,560
他退出了
He's quit.

428
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,630
我们现在做什么 熊猫走了 熊猫走了 谁会成为"龙武士"呢?
What do we do now   with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,800
我们能做的 就是勤加练习 假以时日
All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time

430
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,500
真正的"龙武士"便会脱颖而出
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.

431
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,540
你在这干吗?
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,470
早上好 大师
Hi! Good morning   Master!

433
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,450
我想先热热身
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,580
你是被卡住了
You're stuck.

435
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,020
卡住了? 什么 卡住了?
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,820
是的 我是被卡住了
Nah.  Yeah   I'm stuck.

437
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,830
- 去帮他 - 噢 天哪
- Help him. - Oh   dear.

438
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,430
我数到三! 一 二
Maybe on three. One   two...

439
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,700
...三
...three.

440
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,130
- 谢谢 - 别提这事
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

441
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,140
- 不 我真的很感激... - 不要再提了!
- No   really   I appreciate... - Ever.

442
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,510
你真以为你能一夜练成一字步?
You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,950
这可是数年苦练 才修得的柔韧性
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!

444
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,780
再继以数载 才能用之以战
And years longer to apply it in combat!

445
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,720
把 那 放 下 来!
Put that down!

446
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,290
我们收集的纪念品只能是流血的关节跟断骨
The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,300
好啊 棒极了!
Yeah! EXcellent.

448
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,300
让我们开始吧
Let's get started.

449
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,480
- 你准备好了吗? - 我打小就准备...啊!
- Are you ready? - I was born re...

450
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,440
真不好意思 我以为你说了你准备好了呢
I'm sorry   brother. I thought you said you were ready.

451
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,820
那太彪悍了 我们再来一次吧
That was awesome! Let's go again!

452
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,120
我一直都还比较照顾你 熊猫 可现在不了
I've been taking it easy on you   panda. But no more.

453
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,520
下一个对手 就是我了
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,350
好 太棒了 上吧!
All right! Yeah   let's go!

455
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,920
上前一步
Step forth.

456
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,450
决胜的诀窍就是 找到对手的弱点
The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,390
并让其为之受罪
...and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,800
Oh   yeah!
爽

459
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,230
出其不意 攻其不备!
To take his strength and use it against him...

460
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,790
直到他倒下放弃
...until he finally falls...

461
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,890
认输退出
...or quits.

462
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,930
真的武士绝不言弃
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,210
别担心 大师 我永远不会放弃的!
Don't worry   Master. I will never quit!

464
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,790
如果他够聪明 他不会再爬上来了
If he's smart he won't come back up those steps.

465
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,190
可他会上来的
But he will.

466
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,560
他不会放弃的 是吗?
He's not going to quit   is he?

467
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,390
我可以告诉你 他不会放弃弹跳的
He's not going to quit bouncing I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,340
我记得你说针灸会让我好受些
I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.

469
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,440
相信我 会的
Trust me   it will.

470
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,140
只是不容易找准你的穴位 都是些
It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,880
- 脂肪? - 毛皮 我是想说毛皮的
- Fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur.

472
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,940
知道你是这意思
Sure you were.

473
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,080
我怎么会用体型来评价一个武士 看看我
Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,250
我在这里
I'm over here.

475
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,800
也许你得再看看这个
Maybe you should look at this again.

476
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,300
噢 好吧
Oh   OK.

477
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,090
住手 住手...啊!
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,210
我知道师傅大师是在激励我
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,210
要不是我了解他 我还会以为他是想撵我走
...but if I didn't know better I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,550
我知道他看上去有点无情
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

481
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,160
可他不总是这样的
...but he wasn't always like that.

482
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,550
传说
According to legend

483
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,150
很久前 师傅也曾笑口常开
there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,160
- 不可能 - 可能
- No! - Yes.

485
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,490
那是在....之前
But that was before.

486
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,560
在什么之前?
Before what?

487
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,970
在太郎之前
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,630
是啊 我们不该提起他的
We're not really supposed to talk about him.

489
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,700
要是他打算留下 他也该知道
Well   if he's going to stay here he should know.

490
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,710
大伙 大伙 我知道太郎
Guys   guys   I know about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,240
他是有史以来第一个 学会了师傅千般武艺的徒弟
He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,480
然后他变坏了 然后...就蹲大牢了...
And then he turned bad and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,680
他不只是个徒弟
He wasn'tjust a student.

494
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,860
师傅在他还在襁褓中时就发现了
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,430
抚养他长大 视同己出
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,860
当发现那小子天生就是武学奇才时
And when the boy showed talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,240
师傅倾其所能悉心教导
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,440
信任他 跟他说必将成其大器
He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,880
太郎他永远不满足
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,210
他想得到龙之卷轴
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

501
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,590
可乌龟洞察到他心中的黑暗 拒绝传之于他
But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,620
盛怒之下 太郎血洗山谷
Outraged   Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.

503
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,120
他试图强行夺取龙轴
He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,800
可师傅必须毁灭他自己造就的...
And Shifu had to destroy what he had created.

505
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,330
他怎么忍心呢?
But how could he?

506
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,650
师傅之前从没像爱太郎那样爱过别人
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,160
或者说 从那之后
Or since.

508
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,510
而现在他有机会 来拨乱返正
And now he has a chance to make things right.

509
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,810
训练真正的"龙武士"
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

510
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,910
他却碰到了你
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,860
这只肥胖的玩世不恭的熊猫
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,750
够了!
That is it!

513
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,950
等等 我的错! 我不小心扎到了他面部神经
Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,870
也许心脏也被扎停了
And may have also stopped his heart.

515
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,100
心静
Inner peace.

516
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,370
心静
Inner peace.

517
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,040
心... 心... 心... 心...
Inner...

518
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,550
心静
Inner peace.

519
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,050
谁在外面吵吵闹闹的?给我安静点!
Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,560
心..静...
Inner...

521
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,230
噢 小曾
Oh   Zeng.

522
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,900
太好了
EXcellent.

523
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,910
我要听好消息
I could use some good news right now.

524
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,050
大师 大师
Master! Master!

525
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,980
我有... 是... 呃...大势不妙了
I have... It's... It's very bad news.

526
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,420
师傅
Shifu.

527
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,890
消息就是消息 没有好坏之分
There is just news. There is no good or bad.

528
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,620
大师 你的预言...你的预言是对的!
Master   your vision. Your vision was right.

529
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,100
太郎越狱了 他正赶过来!
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.

530
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,300
这还真是坏消息
That is bad news...

531
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,710
如果你不相信"龙武士"可以阻止他的话
...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

532
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,040
那只熊猫?大师 那熊猫可不是什么"龙武士"
The panda? Master that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,410
根本不该在这儿 那是个巧合
He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.

534
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,780
世上无意外
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,150
是的我知道 你已经说过了
Yes   I know. You've said that already.

536
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,420
- 两遍 - 世上无意外
- Twice. - Well   that was no accident   either.

537
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,590
三次
Thrice.

538
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,290
我的老朋友
My old friend

539
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,960
阿波没法完成他的使命的 你也一样
the panda will never fulfill his destiny   nor you yours

540
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,600
除非别让假象蒙蔽你的眼睛
until you let go of the illusion of control.

541
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,040
假象
Illusion?

542
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,100
没错 看看这棵树 师傅
Yes. Look at this tree   Shifu.

543
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,200
我无法强迫它开花
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me

544
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,550
时机未到我也不能让它结果
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

545
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,140
但是 有些事情我们可以控制的
But there are things we can control.

546
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,310
我可以左右果子何时落地
I can control when the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,090
我还可以左右...
And I can control...

548
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,150
种与何地
...where to plant the seed.

549
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,760
这可不是假象 大师
That is no illusion   Master.

550
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,390
没错...
Yes.

551
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,870
但是无论你做什么
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,870
这种子终会长成桃树
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,810
你也许想要苹果或是橘子 但你能得到的只是桃子而已
You may wish for an apple or an orange but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,510
但是桃子不能打败太郎
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,250
也许可以呢
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,120
只要你愿意对其谆谆教导
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,050
培养它
To nurture it.

558
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,520
坚信它
To believe in it.

559
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,060
但是得怎么做呢? 怎么做呢?
But how? How?

560
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,100
我需要你的帮助 大师
I need your help   Master.

561
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,860
不需要 你只需要相信
No   you just need to believe.

562
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,870
答应我 师傅
Promise me   Shifu.

563
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,170
答应我你会相信
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,800
我尽量
I will try.

565
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,130
很好
Good.

566
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,370
我气数已尽
My time has come.

567
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,950
你得孤身上路了
You must continue your journey without me.

568
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,750
什... 什...你说什...等等
What are you...? Wait!

569
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,160
大师!
Master!

570
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,550
不要丢下我一个
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,960
你必须相信
You must believe.

572
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,500
大师!
Master!

573
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,600
对呀  所以我就说 就算你是狼...
Yeah   so I'm like "Fine   you may be a wolf

574
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,610
也许你还是福建第一恶霸
you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,770
但是你只是个糟糕的搬运工...
...but you're a lousy tipper."

576
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,780
真的?那你是怎么活着回来的?
Really? So how did you get out of there alive?

577
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,950
我... 我没有真的那样说
I mean   I didn't actually say that...

578
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,750
但是我想像
...but I thought it...

579
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,580
在心里
..in my mind.

580
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,710
他要是会读心术的话 他会说：什么
If he could read my mind he'd be   like   "What?"

581
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,450
上菜咯  希望你们喜欢
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,590
- 味道好极了 - 不会吧
- This is really good! - No   come on.

583
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,970
你们应该尝尝我老爸的密汤 他是真的如何配方
You should try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,440
你在说什么? 太好吃了
What are you talking about? This is amazing!

585
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,440
- 你可真会煮 - 我希望我嘴巴再大点
- You're a really good cook. - I wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,410
虎姐 快尝尝
Tigress   you've got to try this.

587
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,110
听说"龙武士"单靠银杏甘露
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months

588
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,980
和日月精华就可活好几个月
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,260
我猜我的身体还不知道 它成了"龙武士"呢
I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

590
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,320
光靠甘露和日月可没法活
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,830
- 笑啥? - 没事 师傅
- What? - Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,630
你永远都不会成为"龙武士" 除非你减掉500磅 还要刷牙
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,310
吵什么吵?! 笑声 我听都没听过
What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,220
努力吧 熊猫 也许有一天
Work hard   panda   and maybe someday...

595
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,190
你会有像我一样的耳朵
...you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,190
还真像
That's good.

597
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,190
耳朵 不好笑吗? 我觉得蛮不错的
Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,650
是师傅!
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,560
当然是师傅 不然你以为我在模仿谁
Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,960
噢... 师傅大师
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,700
你们觉得好笑吗?
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,740
太郎越狱了 你们还跟个毛孩子一样
Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children!

603
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,110
- 什么? - 他是冲着"龙之卷轴"来的
- What? - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll

604
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,540
而你是唯一可以阻止他的人
and you are the only one who can stop him.

605
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,850
哈哈 我以为你没有幽默感呢
And I was saying you got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,220
我要阻止太郎
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,120
啥?! 你当真?我要...
What? You're serious? And I have to...?

608
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,960
乌龟大师会阻止他的像上次一样
Master Oogway will stop him like he did before.

609
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,550
乌龟不能
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,470
再也不能了
Not anymore.

611
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,670
我们唯一的希望就只剩下"龙武士"了
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

612
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,370
- 这熊猫? - 就是这熊猫
- The panda? - Yes   the panda!

613
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,040
师傅 拜托 让我们来阻止太郎 这也是你教我们武功的目的呀
Master   let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,670
不 打败太郎不是你的使命
No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,340
是他!
It is his!

616
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,540
人呢?
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,190
你不可以走 真的武士是永不言弃的
You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits.

618
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,820
看看我
Watch me.

619
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,520
拜托
Come on.

620
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,430
我凭什么打败太郎 我连绕过你下山都不行
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,500
你可以打败他的 因为你是"龙武士"
You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,570
你不会相信的  你从没信过这鬼话
You don't believe that. You never believed that.

623
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,640
从一开始 你就想方设法把我赶走?
From the beginning you've tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,050
没错
Yes! I was.

625
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,250
但现在 我要你相信你师傅 就像我开始相信你一样
But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,050
你不是我师傅 我也不是什么"龙武士"
You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:00,460
那你为什么不放弃 你明知道我要赶你走 但你还是留下了
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone   yet you stayed.

628
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,590
没错 我是留下了
Yeah   I stayed.

629
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,400
我留下是因为 每次你往我头上扔砖头
I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:10,870
或说我臭 很伤，但更让我伤心的是
or said I smelled   it hurt but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,170
每天我看到自己不成材
than it did every day of my life just being me.

632
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,480
我留下 因为我想 要是还有人能改变我
I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,880
可以让我超越自我
...could make me... not me...

634
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,320
那个人就是你
...it was you.

635
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,520
全中国最伟大的功夫师傅
The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!

636
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,180
我能改变你
But I can change you!

637
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,790
我可以让你成为"龙武士" 我会的
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!

638
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,860
拜托 太郎马上就要赶到了
Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.

639
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,330
就算他要在路上耗上个一百年
Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here   how are you...

640
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,670
你又怎么能把我训练成龙武士
...gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior?

641
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,970
哪有办法?
How?

642
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,600
有吗?
How?

643
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,850
- 有吗? - 我不知道
- How?! - I don't know!

644
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,450
我不知道
I don't know.

645
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,270
我就知道
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,070
养兵千日 用兵一时
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,210
虎妞!
Tigress!

648
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,250
别想拦我!
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,520
我们不是要拦你
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,590
什么?
What?

651
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,530
我们是要跟你并肩作战
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,230
怎么啦? 我不开心就吃不行吗?
What? I eat when I'm upset   OK?

653
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,840
噢 不需要解释
No need to eXplain.

654
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:40,080
我还以为是猴子呢，他总把杏仁饼干藏在架子最上面
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,700
别跟猴哥说
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,940
- 看看你 - 我知道 我让你看了恶心
- Look at you. - Yeah   I know   I disgust you.

657
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,000
不 我是说 你是怎么爬上去的?
No   I mean   how did you get up there?

658
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,840
不晓得 我只是...
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,480
不晓得 我只是想拿饼干
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

660
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,450
然后你就瞬间离地十尺
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

661
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,820
而且还做出了完美的一字马
And you have done a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,860
不是啦 这只是...
No   this? This is just...

663
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,920
一个意外
...an accident.

664
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,230
世上无意外
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,360
跟我来
Come with me.

666
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,810
我知道你为教我武功  故弄玄虚
I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,610
但也至少告诉我现在是去哪吧?
...but could you at least tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,000
你...
You dragged me...

669
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,790
让我累死累活爬上来...
...all the way out here...

670
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,160
为了洗澡?
...for a bath?

671
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,130
熊猫
Panda...

672
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,830
这池神圣之泪可不是给你洗腋窝的
...we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,100
这是池...
The Pool of...

674
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,770
这是乌龟大师参透禅机的地方
This is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,040
两极调和
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,040
这就是功夫的发源地
This is the birthplace..of kung fu.

677
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,230
你想学功夫？
Do you want to learn kung fu?

678
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,290
当然
Yeah!

679
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,640
那么我就是你师傅
Then I am your master!

680
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,470
OK!

681
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:47,900
不要哭
Don't cry.

682
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,310
OK.

683
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,040
当你一心想着功夫
When you focus on kung fu

684
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,250
当你集中精神时
when you concentrate...

685
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,820
你就发臭
...you stink.

686
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,760
也许那是我的错
Perhaps that is my fault.

687
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:06,280
我不该一成不变 像教导"五杰"一样训练你
I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.

688
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,460
不过现在我明白了 要你学好武功
I now see that the way to get through to you...

689
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,830
就得靠这个
...is with this.

690
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,660
噢 太棒了 因为我饿死了
Oh   great   'cause I am hungry.

691
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,630
很好
Good.

692
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,400
你有点长进的时候 就可以吃了
When you have been trained   you may eat.

693
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,000
开始训练
Let us begin.

694
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:32,810
熊猫 你先请
After you   panda.

695
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,850
这么简单?
Just like that?

696
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,580
不需要仰卧起坐?不需要十里跑步?
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

697
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:43,150
我发誓教你武功 你也学有所成 你可以尽情享用了
I vowed to train you   and you have been trained. You are free to eat.

698
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,160
慢用
Enjoy.

699
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,170
嘿
Hey!

700
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,360
我说了你可以尽情享用 来个饺子
I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.

701
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,170
嘿
Hey!

702
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,420
随便吃
You are free to eat.

703
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,380
- 我行吗?!?! - 你行吗?!
- Am I?! - Are you?!

704
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,300
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

705
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,100
师傅
Master.

706
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,540
砍断吊桥!
Cut it!

707
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,560
"龙武士"怎么没来?
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

708
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:35,620
你怎么知道我不是?
How do you know you're not looking at her?

709
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,890
你以为我这么好忽悠?
You think I'm a fool?

710
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,600
我知道你不是 你们都不是
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!

711
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,940
我听说了他是从天而降的火球
I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire.

712
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:49,440
他才是武士 前无古人
That he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.

713
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:55,110
- 阿波? - 那就是他的名字?阿波
- Po? - So that is his name. Po.

714
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,280
我终于棋逢对手
Finally   a worthy opponent.

715
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,850
这场对决将流传万世
Our battle will be legendary!

716
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,540
我们来拉住  你去帮她
We've got this. Help her.

717
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,160
猴哥!
Monkey!

718
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,070
拿着
Go!

719
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,330
我在想什么
What was I thinking?!

720
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,780
螳O!
Mantis!

721
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,460
快啊!
Now!

722
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,670
师傅教得不错
Shifu taught you well.

723
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,580
但是没有把所有都传授给你们
But he didn't teach you everything.

724
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,170
你表现不错 熊猫
You have done well   panda.

725
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,950
表现不错? 表现不错
Done well? Done well?

726
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,320
我表现彪悍
I've done awesome!

727
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,220
真的英雄要谦虚
The mark of a true hero is humility.

728
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,990
虽然这样说 你表现确实...
But   yes   you have done...

729
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,930
彪悍
...awesome.

730
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,510
伙计们? 伙计们 他们死了!
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

731
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,010
不对 还在呼吸 睡着了? 但是眼睛睁着
No   they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open.

732
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,070
我们根本不是对手 都被点穴了
We were no match for his nerve attach.

733
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,380
他更强大了
He's gotten stronger.

734
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,750
谁? 太郎吗?更强了?
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

735
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:45,940
他太快了
He's too fast!

736
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,580
对不起 阿波
Sorry   Po.

737
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,220
我以为我们可以阻止他的
I thought we could stop him.

738
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,120
他本来可以杀了你们的
He could have killed you.

739
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,250
那他为什么没呢?
Why didn't he?

740
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,730
让你们活着回来引起我们的害怕，但是我们不怕
So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work.

741
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,130
也许会，一点点
It might. I mean   a little.

742
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,400
我是非常害怕
I'm pretty scared.

743
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,960
你可以打败他的 熊猫
You can defeat him   panda!

744
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,980
你在说笑吧? 他们都不行...
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

745
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,040
他们可是五大高手，我只是 一个我而已
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

746
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:15,480
但是 你拥有一样任何人都没有的东西
But you will have the one thing that no one else does.

747
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,310
你真的相信我已经准备好了?
You really believe I'm ready?

748
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,050
你是
You are...

749
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,420
阿波

01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,940

是你的了
It is yours.

752
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,950
等等 如果我读了它的话会怎么样
Wait. What happens when I read it?

753
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,050
传说可以听到蝴蝶振翅之音
Legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

754
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,350
哦 真的? 酷
Really? That's cool.

755
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:33,260
是的 能在至深之洞中看见光
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

756
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,230
感知宇宙万物的动作
You will feel the universe in motion around you.

757
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,330
哇哦! 我能打烂墙吗?
Can I punch through walls?

758
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,770
- 我能做后空翻吗? - 心无杂念
- Do a quadruple back flip? - Focus.

759
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,030
- 我能...? - 心无杂念
- Will I...? - Focus.

760
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,840
- 心无杂念 - 哦 好的 好的
- Focus. - Oh   yeah   yeah.

761
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:46,810
阿波 认真读 然后完成你的使命
Read it   Po   and fulfill your destiny.

762
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,070
读吧 成为
Read it and become...

763
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,870
"龙武士"!
...the Dragon Warrior.

764
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,220
根本打不开
It's impossible to open.

765
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:03,420
加油 加油
OK. Come on   baby. Come on now.

766
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,290
谢谢
Thank you.

767
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,760
也许是我刚才帮你弄松了吧?
I probably loosened it up for you though.

768
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,590
好了 开始了
OK   here goes.

769
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,270
- 是空白 - 什么?
- It's blank. - What?!

770
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,940
- 是的 你看 - 不，我是不准看的
- Here   look. - No   I am forbidden to look upon...

771
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,530
空白 我不...
Blank. I don't...

772
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,790
我不明白
I don't understand.

773
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,790
好吧 也就是说
OK. So   like...

774
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,100
乌龟也不过就是只疯癫老王八
...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.

775
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,760
不 乌龟比我们都要聪明
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

776
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,900
哦 拜托 面对现实 他意外选了我
Oh   come on! Face it he picked me by accident.

777
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,110
我当然不是什么"龙武士" 开什么玩笑
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?

778
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,840
但是谁来阻止太郎呢?
But who will stop Tai Lung?

779
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,410
他会毁了一切 并杀了每个人的
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

780
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,150
不会的
No.

781
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,980
撤散山谷 你们必须保护村民们免受太郎攻击
Evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

782
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,460
- 那您怎么办呢 师傅? - 我来对付他
- What about you   Master? - I will fight him.

783
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,230
- 什么? - 我可以尽可能久的拖延
- What? - I can hold him off long enough

784
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,770
这样大家都能全身而退
for everyone to escape.

785
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,270
但是 师傅 他会杀了你的
But   Shifu   he'll kill you.

786
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,170
那我就为我的错误付出代价了
Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.

787
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,230
都听我说
Listen to me   all of you.

788
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:30,840
没有我 你们也要继续走下去
It is time for you to continue your journey without me.

789
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,910
我非常自豪成为你们的师傅
I am very proud to have been your master.

790
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,070
我们必须让他们安全地转移
We've got to get them out safely.

791
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,470
别怕 小猪猪 我们去找妈妈
Come   little one. Let's find your mama.

792
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,070
小蛇 聚集村子南边的人 螳螂 你去村北
Viper   gather the southern farmers. Mantis   the north.

793
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,880
阿鹤 点灯引路
Crane   light the way.

794
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,960
看 那就是"龙武士"
Look   it's the Dragon Warrior.

795
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,080
嗨 老爸
Hey   Dad.

796
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,980
阿波!
Po!

797
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,980
很高兴见你回来 儿子
Good to have you back   son.

798
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,950
很高兴能回来
Good to be back.

799
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,650
我们走吧 阿波
Let's go   Po.

800
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,000
我们该规划一下 下一家面馆了
So for our next shop it's time to face it...

801
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,760
面的未来就是切成块的蔬菜
...the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables...

802
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,200
再不是蔬菜丝
...no longer slices.

803
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,710
我还在想...这次
Also   I was thinking   maybe this time

804
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,940
也许这次我们可以有一个厨房 你可以堂堂正正做个大厨
we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.

805
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,440
喜欢不?
You like that?

806
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:24,180
阿波 我很遗憾 事情不顺利
Po   I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

807
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,290
命运本就不该如此
It just wasn't meant to be.

808
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:33,260
阿波 忘了这些吧
Po   forget everything else.

809
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,530
你的命运还在等你
Your destiny still awaits.

810
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,370
我们是面条世家 血管里流淌着面条的血!
We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.

811
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,740
我不知道 老爸
I don't know   Dad.

812
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,800
说实话 有时我不敢相信我是你儿子
Honestly   sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.

813
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:51,280
阿波
Po...

814
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:55,790
我想是时候告诉你 一些很久以前就该
...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you...

815
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,920
告诉你的事了
...a long time ago.

816
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,720
好的
OK.

817
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,230
我那私酿密汤的配方
The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

818
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:12,600
靠近点 配方就是
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

819
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,660
啥都没
...nothing.

820
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,580
你听到了 啥都没
You heard me. Nothing!

821
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,110
根本就没什么秘之又秘的配方
There is no secret ingredient!

822
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:23,240
等等 不过是普通的面汤?
Wait   wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?

823
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,190
什么特别酱汁都没加?或者其他什么
You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?

824
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,660
没那必要 想让一件东西特别 你只要相信那是特别的就够了
Don't have to. To make something special   you just believe it's special.

825
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,830
根本没有秘方
There is no secret ingredient.

826
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,230
我回家来了 师傅
I have come home   Master.

827
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,560
这里不再是你家了 我也不再是你师傅了
This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.

828
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:16,570
是啊 你已经另有新宠了
Oh   yes. You have a new favorite.

829
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,730
那么这个阿波人呢?
So where is this Po?

830
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,400
我把他吓跑了吗?
Did I scare him off?

831
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,810
这是你我之间的战斗
This battle is between you and me.

832
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,650
那么 就如你所言吧
So   that is how it's going to be.

833
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,740
必须如我所言!
That is how it must be.

834
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:50,460
我在大牢里蹲了20年 就因为你的懦弱
I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!

835
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,910
听师父的话  怎叫弱点
Obeying your master is not weakness!

836
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,770
你知道的 我原本应是"龙武士"
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

837
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,010
你一直知道
You always knew.

838
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,020
但是当乌龟说 非也 你做什么了?
But when Oogway said otherwise what did you do?

839
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:06,680
你做什么了?
What did you do?!

840
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,350
什么都没做!
Nothing!

841
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:13,260
你本来就不是龙武士 那不是我的错!
You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!

842
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:15,300
不是你的错?
Not your fault?!

843
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,420
是谁让我充满梦想?
Who filled my head with dreams?!

844
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,730
是谁让我练功练到骨断筋逆?
Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!

845
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,530
是谁否定了我的命运?
Who denied me my destiny?!

846
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,370
我从未做过这样的决定
It was never my decision to make!

847
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,150
那就趁现在
It is now.

848
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:49,990
给 我 卷 轴 !
Give me the scroll!

849
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,290
我宁可死
I would rather die.

850
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:44,540
我做的一切都是为了让你骄傲
All I ever did   I did to make you proud!

851
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,210
告诉我你有多骄傲 师父!
Tell me how proud you are   Shifu!

852
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,680
告诉我!
Tell me!

853
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,950
告诉我!
Tell me!

854
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,640
我...我一直都为你骄傲
I have... I have always been proud of you.

855
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,110
从一开始 我就
From the first moment   I've been...

856
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,480
为你骄傲
...proud of you.

857
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,910
是这种骄傲
And it was my pride...

858
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:17,010
让我看不清你
...that blinded me.

859
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,650
我太爱你了 而看不到你的变化
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...

860
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,920
是因为我
...what I...

861
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,980
你才变成这样的
...was turning you into.

862
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,760
对
I'm...

863
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

864
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,070
我不要你的道歉
I don't want your apology.

865
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,670
我要卷轴!
I want my scroll!

866
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,110
什么!
What?!

867
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,410
卷轴去哪了?!
Where is it?!

868
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:54,010
"龙武士"早已带着卷轴穿行在神州大地
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.

869
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,290
你永远见不到那卷轴了 太郎
You will never see that scroll   Tai Lung.

870
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,690
永远
Never.

871
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:01,620
永远
Never.

872
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:09,870
台阶太多了...
Stairs.

873
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,100

他?他是只熊猫
Him? He's a panda.

877
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,420
你就是只熊猫 你要干什么? 大家伙 泰山压顶?
You're a panda. What are you gonna do   big guy? Sit on me?

878
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,430
别把我惹毛了
Don't tempt me.

879
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:36,520

那个卷轴是我的!
That scroll is mine!

883
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,470
闪电般
Lightning!

884
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:40,680
卷轴给了他力量
The scroll has given him power!

885
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,880
不
No!

886
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,300
终于 哦 太好了
Finally! Oh   yes.

887
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:28,230
龙轴的力量 是我的!
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

888
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,570
什么都没!
It's nothing!

889
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,140
没关系 我第一次也没看出个所以然来
It's OK. I didn't get it the first time   either.

890
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:40,940
什么?
What?

891
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,980
根本没有秘方
There is no secret ingredient.

892
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,750
只有你
It's just you.

893
01:17:58,530 --> 01:17:59,590
停下
Stop it!

894
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,430
我要尿尿

944
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:20,590
Everybody is kung fu fighting

945
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:24,760
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

946
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,090
Although the future is a little bit frightening

947
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:33,760
It's the book of your life that you're writing

948
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:39,930
Everybody is kung fu fighting

949
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:44,440

It's the book of your life that you're writing

952
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,150
You are a natural

953
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,460
Why is that so hard to see?

954
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,690
Maybe it's just because You keep on looking at me

955
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:07,830
The journey's a lonely one So much more than we know

956
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:11,800
But sometimes you've got to go And be your own hero

957
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:14,810

962
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,290
You could be a work of art If you just go all the way

963
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:42,170
Now what would it take to break? I believe that you can bend

964
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,610
Not only do you have to fight But you have got to win

965
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,800
'Oause everybody is kung fu fighting

966
