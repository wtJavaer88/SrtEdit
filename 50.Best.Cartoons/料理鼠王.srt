-Only me. Why do you think that is? -Well, I...

645
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,778
因为高级餐饮是建立在由愚蠢的老男人

有什么事比家庭还重要?
What do you "have to" more than family?

这里还有什么是更重要的?
What's more important here?

938

- 为什么这么叫 - 什么?
-Hey! Why do they call it that? -What?

947
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:37,998
Ratatouille 这是道炖菜吧 为什么这么叫
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right? Why do they call it that?

948
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:39,670
如果你要命名食物
If you're going to name a food,

949
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:42,709
应该选个听起来就美味的名字
you should give it a name that sounds delicious.

950
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:48,077
Ratatouille听起来就不好吃啊 听起来像"老鼠"和"屁屁"
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious. It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

951
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:52,413
老鼠 屁屁听起来一点都不好吃
Rat patootie. Which does not sound delicious.

952

可惜了 酒都喝光了
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

953

(ALL CHEERING )

955
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:34,121
找人代替你做毒药检测器简直是不可能
And finding someone to replace you for poison checker has been a disaster.

956
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,065
没什么被下毒了 谢天谢地 不过这可不简单啊
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God, but it hasn't been easy.

957
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:42,671
- 你把这事弄的复杂了 - 我知道 对不起 爸爸

你消瘦了好多 怎么回事
You look thin. Why is that?

961
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:54,973
没吃饱还是为了显示与众不同?
A shortage of food, or a surplus of snobbery?

962
00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:00,680
一个人在外面闯荡不容易吧
It's tough out there in the big world all alone, isn't it?

963
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,851
嗯 但我不是小孩了
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

-Hey. Hey, boy. What's up? -I can take care of myself.

I've found a nice spot not far away, so I'll be able to visit often.

966

没什么能比现实的残酷更能...
Nothing like a cold splash of reality to make you...

967
00:58:14,305 --> 00:58:17,103
- 回家看看? - 嗯 我保证 常回来
-Visit? -I will. I promise. Often.

- 你不打算留在家里? - 不 这不是什么大不了的 爸 我就是
-You're not staying? -No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

969
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:24,874
你不会以为我会一辈子都呆在家里吧
You didn't think I was going to stay forever, did you?

970
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,212
小鸟总归是要离巢高飞的
Eventually, a bird's got to leave the nest.

971
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:29,582
我们不是鸟 我们是老鼠
We're not birds. We're rats.

972
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:32,623
我们从不离巢穴 我们只会越来越壮大
We don't leave our nests. We make them bigger.

973

- 也许我是与众不同的老鼠 - 也许你根本就不是老鼠
-Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat. -Maybe you're not a rat at all.
