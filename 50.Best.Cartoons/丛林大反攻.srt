No denying. The girl's got growl. But can she get down like this?

她会无影脚吗？ 看我，我才是世上最厉害的
Can you get down like this? Bring it here. Bring it.

煞星，还有三天打猎季节才开始
Shaw, hunting season doesn't start for three days.

30
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,986
你的引擎盖上怎么会有一头鹿
What are you doing with that buck on your hood?

31
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:23,618
干嘛，关我屁事 是他自己傻不隆咚跑来撞我的卡车
What? It ain't my fault. He ran right in front of my truck.

-我挂了吗？ -快了

39
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,907
煞星的车撞得歪七扭八的
But seeing how that is Shaw's truck--

40
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,839
-煞星是啥？ -山林村里最烂的猎人
- What's a Shaw? - Only the nastiest hunter in town.

41
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,741
猎人，你也被抓了吗？
A hunter? Did he get you too?

42
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,211
你有看到我被五花大绑吗？
You don't see me tied up, do you, baby?

43
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:21,147
-这是我的酷车 -你的酷车？
- This is my ride. - Your ride?

44
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,753
对，这全是我的
Yeah, this is my town, okay?

45
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:26,186
村民跟我超麻吉的 这里是我的地盘
These are my people. This is where I reside.

46
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,726
没有人能猎捕我这头熊
Nobody's hunting this bear.

47
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,327
真的？那就把我解开 求求你，又没有人在看
Really? Well, then untie me. Please? Look, no one's looking.

48
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,799
-我办不到 -那我怎么办？
- Ain't gonna be able to do it. - What am I gonna do?

我不想变成墙上的鹿头
I don't wanna be mounted on a wall.

50

-安啦，不会的啦 -不会？
- Calm down. Ain't gonna happen. - It's not?

51
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:48,504
-你还不够格啦 -什么叫做我不够…？
- Not with that rack. - I don't have a problem with--

52
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,080
我的… 那是…
My... It's...

53
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:55,517
我变成独角鹿 不要瞄我，不要瞄我
I'm a unihorn. Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

54
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:59,020
我丑毙了，我是四不像
I'm hideous. I'm a monster.

55
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:00,238
- Tree-hugger. - Knuckle dragger.

56
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,986
-乡下土包子 -山顶洞人

58
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,688
好了…你们不要吵了
All right, all right. That's enough, you two.

59
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:08,162
听好，笨熊奶妈 畜牲蠢到不行
Listen, Girl Scout, they're dumb animals.

60
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:13,965
我只是尊重大自然的法则 人最优，畜牲是最低等的
I'm just respecting the natural order: man on top, animals on the bottom.

61
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,734
你的熊… 不对…你的笨熊与众不同
But your bear-- Now, now, your bear is special.

62
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,878
他算是夹在中间的物种
He belongs somewhere in the middle.

63
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:25,073
是夹在两片面包里的烤熊沙威犸
Between two slices of rye, smothered in gravy.

64
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:29,886
煞星，你真的是超级变态的怪叔叔
You're a sick, sick, twisted puppy, Shaw.

65

Six-toed gun monkey. Boog, come on, let's get out of here.

Come on, I'm begging you. Please, please. Just untie me.

68
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,672
我求求你…
Come on. Please, please, please?

69
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,908
快走啊，快窜回你的森林吧，兄弟
Hey, go on now. Scamper on back to the woods, little buddy.

70
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,614
独角小怪鹿
Little one-horned freak.

71
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,813

My truck. Why, you little--

74
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,931
煞星，村里不准开枪
Shaw, no shooting in town.

75
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:21,334
可是戈帝… 那只熊用爪子放掉了我的鹿
But, Gordy, that bear leaned over and untied my buck.

76
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:25,966
-你没看到吗？ -我只看到破碎的车灯，煞星
- Didn't you see that? - All I see is a busted headlight.

77
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:31,172
你在森林里待太久得妄想症了
Shaw, you've been living in the woods too long.

78
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,714
管它妄想症、狂牛症 抓到那只鹿才是真的
They can't tell me what I seen, because only I know what I seen.

79
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:45,058

Oh, did I forget something?

86
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,896
不行…不能再多吃了
No, no, no. No more treats for you.

88
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:33,873
别装可爱了，不要挤眉弄眼的
Not the face. Oh, no, not the eyebrows too.

撒娇也没有用 好了啦，我是说真的
No, it's not gonna work this time. Stop it. I'm serious, Boog.

很可爱，但是不行… 好吧
It's cute, but no-- All right.

如果你今天跑进森林 你最好伪装自己
<i>If you go out in the woods today You'd better go in disguise</i>

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,366
因为森林里每一只熊
<i>For every bear That ever there was</i>

94
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,197
都会在这里聚在一起
<i>Will gather there together because</i>

95

- Hey, buddy. It's me, Elliot. - What are you doing here?

这里够大，两个人住刚刚好
This place is big enough for two.

111

00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:20,046
我才不在乎那破娃娃咧
I don't care about that old thing.

117
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:27,152
我懂了，你就是宠物

就像美眉一样，白泡泡幼绵绵
She's my lady. Smooth and creamy.

144
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,592
你好坏，不可以，管他咧
So bad, I shouldn't. Yet I will.

145
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,067
这是什么？
What is that?

146
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,073
哦，交给我处理
Whoa, let me try.

147
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,675

I come in peace.

150
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,274
我发财了
I'm foraging.

151

来啊，最威猛大熊 晚安
Behold, the mighty grizzly. Good night.

155
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:21,590
如果你今天跑进森林 可以吃…吃大炸鸡
<i>If you go out in the woods today There's gonna be some fries</i>

156
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,758
长颈鹿饼干
Yeah, and the giraffes...

157
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:30,458
吃起来好像大象饼干哦！
...they taste almost exactly like the elephants.

158
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,830
这全搞乱了
That's messed up.

159
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,699

糟了，快点倒车 不能让她看到我
Back up quick, before she sees me.

161
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,485
你死定了，大个儿
You're in big trouble, mister.

162
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,186
你知道你吃糖的后果会怎样
You know what sugar does to you, Boog.

163
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,830
上床去，快去
Straight to bed, now!

164
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,763
真的很抱歉，都怪我 保证下不为例
I'm so sorry. It's my fault. It won't happen again.

165
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,599
-要是他伤了人怎么办？ -戈帝，拜托
- What if he had hurt someone? - Gordy, please.

166
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,436
-我们谈的是布谷耶 -看什么看？
- We're talking about Boog here. - Hey, what are you looking at?

167
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,805
我叫你不要等我的
I told you not to wait up.

168
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,972
-我知道…我会带他回森林 -你应该让他回到大自然去
- I'll take him back to the woods. - It's time to put him where he belongs.

169
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,950
不行…他还没有做好准备 我是说…不是我的错
No, no, he's not ready to go back yet. I mean, it's not my fault.

170
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:26,022
我教过他求生技能
I tried to teach him the basics.

171
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,592
我带他去捕鱼 可是他不想把脚弄湿
I took him fishing, but he didn't wanna get wet.

172
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:32,963
戈帝，别这样不要…
Gordy, please--

173
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,368
布谷对不起你
Boog is sorry.

174
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:43,964
-贝丝，你不是他妈妈 -我本来就不是
- Beth, you're not his mother. - I'm not mothering him.

175
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,039
抱歉… 立刻给我上床去
Excuse me. Go to bed, Boog!

176
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,582
再一个夏天
One more summer.

177
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,779
我别无所求，再一个夏天
That's all I'm asking, one summer.

178
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,451
太好了，看吧，我也可以讲理 谢了
Great, see? I can be reasonable. Thanks.

179
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,595
你很清楚
You know something?

180
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:09,028
你拖得越久 他就越难适应大自然的生存环境
The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be for him to adapt.

181
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:13,836
放心，他一定会… 至少我觉得他会
Oh, I'm sure he'll... At least I think he'll--

182
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:17,031
到时候你会越舍不得…放他走
And the harder it's gonna be for you to let him go.

183
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,373
晚安，贝丝
Good night, Beth.

184
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,436
我该拿你怎么办才好？
What am I gonna do with you?

185
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,787
这不是低咖啡因的 你明知道咖啡因会害惨我
This isn't decaf. You know what caffeine does to me, Bob.

186
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,555
我会碎碎念，念到你耳朵出油
I'd be talking up a storm, chatting your ear off...

187
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,521
嘴角冒泡了，还停不下来
...a mile a minute for the whole ride.

188
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:15,359
腊肠先生，走了 走啦，腊肠先生
Mr. Weenie, heel. Heel, Mr. Weenie.

189
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,769
烫…
Hot.

190
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:26,133
好苦 非常苦，但又非常香醇
It's terrible but wonderful at the same time.

191
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,404
就像杯底不可以养金鱼
It's like freedom in a cup.

192
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,247
爽啦，乎干啦
Out of hand.

193
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,648
听说布谷昨天晚上跑出来乱
You know, I heard Boog got loose last night...

194
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,418
把这里搞得乱七八糟的
...and he totally trashed the place.

195
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,084
-真的？ -我干嘛骗你
- Really? - That's what happened.

196
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,925
这里感觉好像不太对劲
There's something wrong going on here.

197
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:55,737
畜牲，还会像人类一样走路…
You? It walks like a man.

198
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:06,847
不要跑 你这个边走路边喝拿铁的怪鹿
Hold still, you two-legged latte drinker.

199
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,246
小心
Look out!

200
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,956
别又来了
Not again.

201
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,719
布谷会让你们 好想拍拍你们的熊掌
Boog will have you eating out of his paw.

202
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:23,190
懂吗，熊掌 因为他是熊吗？
Get it? "Paw," because he's a bear?

203
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:27,236
-总之啊… -烦死了
- So anyway... - Oh, man.

204
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:31,136
放轻松，布谷，你做得到
Okay, relax, Boog. You can do this.

205

你在乱什么？ 快出去啦
What are you doing? Get out of here. Hey.

207
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,016
有人在追杀我
He's right behind me.

208
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,018
我就知道，那只笨熊教坏我的鹿
I knew it. That bear's corrupted my buck.

209
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,149
掩护我
Hide me.

-你给我惹了一堆麻烦 -我…谁叫你救了我
- You got me in enough trouble. - Hey, I-- You saved my life.

214
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,383
活该，你救了我就有责任保护我
That means that you're responsible for me.

215
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:19,819

226
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,210
吃人，他才不会 布谷你在干什么？

Out of my way. Move.

238
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,580
没戏唱了，你这个四脚怪ㄎㄚ

246
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,727
煞星
Shaw?

247

戈帝，我… 我不知道该怎么办
Gordy, I didn't know what else to do. I--

248
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:23,211
是时候了，贝丝
It's time, Beth.

打猎季节很危险耶
But what about hunting season?

250
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:28,432
Take him above the falls. He'll be safe there.

251
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:29,612
送他到瀑布上面去，那里很安全

252
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,490
Take him above the falls. He'll be safe there.

253

我的家呢？ 不见了
Where's home? It's gone.

258
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,585
被人偷走了
Someone stole it.

259
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:25,356
小声一点好不好
Hey, could you keep it down?

260

我还想要再睡一下啦
I'm trying to sleep here.

261
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:32,826

You.

262
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:35,233
-我怎么了？ -你看清楚了，爱鹿特
- No, I didn't do it. - Take a good look, Elliot.

263
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,738
你看到什么了？ 什么东西不见了？
What do you see, Elliot? Something's missing, Elliot.

264
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:39,341
是什么，爱鹿特 是什么？
What is it, Elliot? What is it?

265
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,637
等等，不要说，我…
Wait, don't tell me. I...

266
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,370
山林村不见了
Timberline is missing!

267
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:46,141
-我本来要猜这个的 -我的车库不见了

早餐、午餐、晚餐都不见了

270
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,358
不然你想怎么样？
What are you gonna do?

271
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,333
你好搞笑哦
You're funny.

272
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:08,370
我想你也许会…那我的小命就… 然后…
I thought, "Maybe," but then I was like... and then--

273
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:11,264
这是不可能的 一定是贝丝误会了
This ain't happening. It's some kind of mistake.

274
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:14,104
好好想想 她很气，但我可以搞定她
Think, Boog. She's mad, but you can fix this.

275
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,576
我要赶快回去对着她装可爱
All right, I'll go back and I'll give her the face.

276
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,374
装可爱
The face.

277
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:21,677
我现在就回去 免得她忘了我的可爱
Gotta get back before she forgets the face.

278
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:25,447
没错，只要靠我这张装可爱的脸 一切搞定
That'll clear it all up right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the face.

279
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,089
布谷
Boog!

280
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:34,295
你不能像这样到处乱闯乱逛
You can't just go wandering around out here.

281
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,296
你根本就不知道你要去哪里
You don't know where you're going, Boog!

282
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,866
我要回家去
I'm going home.

283
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:40,697
等等，布谷，我…
Wait. Boog.

284
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:43,164
我知道山林村怎么走
I know where Timberline is.

285
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,174
-我可以带你回去 -谢了，不必麻烦了
- I can get you back. - Thank you, but no thank you.

Quiet.

287
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,950
山林村一定在这附近
Timberline's gotta be around here somewhere.

288
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:00,617
不错，满快的嘛
Well, that was quick.

289
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:08,661
让我想想 屁屁向左，屁屁向右
Now, let's see. Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

290
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,502
布谷，是你吗？
Boog, is that you?

291
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:30,244
布谷
Boog.

292
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,355
现在我只要摸清楚这个地方
Okay, I gotta get the lay of the land.

293
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,467
我只要…
Somehow...

294
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,503
爬到最高处就可以了
...if I get up high enough, then...

295
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,673
太好了
All right.

296
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:53,036
我做得到的
I can do this.

297
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,878
没问题啦
No problem.

298
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,111
你是什么玩意？ 到处乱逛
Lost your way to Sunday school, pal?

299
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:05,813
这里是妙酷鼠的地盘 没有人敢惹妙酷鼠
This is McSquizzy's turf. Nobody messes with McSquizzy.

300
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,753
因为他就是我
Because that's me.

301
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:09,893
-什么？ -你要是敢碰这棵树的话
- What? - Touch a needle in this tree...

302
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,257
-我就K得你满头包 -是吗？
- ...and I'll give you such a doing! - Yeah?

303
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,557
就凭你一个？
You and what army?

304
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,032
算你狠
Oh, that army.

305
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,433
不要惹火小松鼠军团
Mess not with the furrytail clan.

306
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:25,063
好料的捍卫者 正义的圣战士
Defenders of the good, crusaders of the righteous...

307
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:27,472
松树的守护神
...guardians of the pine.

308
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:31,881
谁稀罕啊 我去找另一棵就好了
Keep your tree. I'll find another one.

309
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,353
快看，熊妈妈背着熊娃娃
Look! He's got a wee freakish twin growing out of his back.

310
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:45,726
这棵不错
Oh, this one will work.

311
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:48,922
-啊呀！ -这只是个小小的警告
Hey. That was a warning, all right?

312
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:53,094
你再乱来 我就踹得你眼冒金星，鼻孔开花
Try that again, and I'll be kicking your furry brown bahookie!

313
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,261
这是另外一棵树耶
- What? - Hey, this is a different tree.

314
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,066
这全是我的树
They're all my trees.

315
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,369
我建议你闪远一点 滚回你原来的地方去
I suggest you turn round and head right back from whence you came.

316
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:03,445
我也想那么做啊 只要跟我说山林村怎么走
That's what I'm trying to do. So just point me the way to town...

317
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,479
我马上走人
...and I'll be out of here.

318
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:13,316
我受够了，这是你们自找的
That's it. You're asking for a whooping.

319
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:15,023
预备…
Ready!

320
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:16,682
发射
Fire!

321
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,788
布谷，快看，空手倒立哦
Hey, Boog, look. No hands.

322
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,763
太阳把我的屁股晒得红通通的
I think I'm getting a sunburn, though.

323
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,196
你看嘛
Check it out.

324
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:28,968
好啦，要怎么走？
All right, where's town?

325
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:32,768
也许我的屁股应该叫做猴子屁股
Or what we would call this, a moon burn.

326
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:36,744
你少打屁 快点说
Look, just give me the directions.

327
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,211
我真的很想回去
I really need to get back.

328
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:39,644
好可怜哦
So sad.

329
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:43,412
-你到底说不说？ -好啦…我说
- Where's Timberline? - Okay. Okay. All right.

330
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,214
你在山林村过得很享受吧
You got it good in Timberline, right?

331
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,950
有咖啡、哇塞棒，还有保全
Coffee, Woo Hoo bars, safety.

332
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:52,493
-那又怎样 -不过你还少了一样
- Yeah, so? - And still, something is missing.

333
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,358
-有吗？ -有，我
- There is? - Yep. Me.

334
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:56,522
让我参一ㄎㄚ，布谷 我带你回去
And I want in, Boog. I'll take you to town...

335
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,793
回到村里后，我们两个结拜
...but when we get there, we're partners.

336
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:00,960
怎么样啊？ 哥儿们
Deal, partner?

337
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,936
什么？ 不…不可以
What? Oh, no, no, no.

338
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:06,167
那是不可能的事，不可能
That ain't never gonna happen. Never.

339
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,311
难道你都没有家人吗？
Don't you have a herd to get back to?

340
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:12,381
家人，他们… 我家人他们会谅解的
What--? My herd? They-- My herd will understand.

341
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,642
那些鹿是…是我的好哥儿们
These guys are my-- They're my buddies.

342
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:17,651
-他…他们会祝福我的 -别作梦了
- They-- They want the best for me. - Forget it.

343
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:21,587
好吧，那我劝你快闪
Oh, well. Better start moving, then.

344
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,852
因为打猎季节过几天就要开始了
Because open season starts in a few days.

345
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,462
也许那些猎人会为了送你回家
Maybe one of those hunters can give you a ride back...

346
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,030
就把你绑在引擎盖上
...on the hood of their truck.

347
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,759
猎人，可恶
Hunters. Dang.

348
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:37,467
-好啦… -那我们讲定？
- Okay, okay. - So we have a deal, then?

349
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,939
好，我要你亲口说
Okay, let me hear you say it.

350
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,343
-好哥儿们？ -你很恶耶
- Partners? - You're disgusting.

351
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,815
-你说什么？ -我…哥儿们
- What was that? - I...

352
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,918
-抱歉，听不见 -我说我可以做好…
- Sorry, can't hear you. - I said, I guess...

353
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,648
好…哥儿们
...we can be partners.

354
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,316
好…哥儿们？
Partners?

355
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,957
一言为定
Partners.

356
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,693
心动不如马上行动
Okey-dokey, this way! Move it or lose it!

357
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,962
我一直在想 应该来搞个秘密手势
You know, we should have a secret handshake...

358
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,902
想代号什么的 超酷的化名
...and like nicknames and stuff. Like, cool nicknames, though.

359
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,474
我就叫你布谷侠
I'll call you Boogster...

360
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,009
你可以叫我超人特攻鹿
...and then you can call me The Incredible Mister E.

361
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,238
很赞吧 我自己想出来的
Isn't that great? I came up with that myself.

362
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:19,678
神来的一笔 这一切都会很酷
I made that up. You know, this is gonna be awesome.

363
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,317
只有你和我
It's just you and me.

364
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:24,477
那个热裤妞是你什么人？
Hey, who's the lady in the shorts?

365
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,565
希望还来得及
I hope I'm not too late.

366
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,131
他们出来一整夜了
They've been out here all night.

367
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,297
熊…
A bear...

368
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,171
和鹿竟然联手出击
...and a deer, working together.

369
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:49,206
这个阴谋诡计有多可怕？
How far does this conspiracy go?

370
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:52,041
还有哪些畜牲加入？ 妈妈咪呀…
What other animals are involved? God bless America!

371
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:55,185
但愿那些畜牲还没有造反
I hope the bald eagle hasn't turned.

372
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,546
不会…
No, no, no.

373
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:59,712
应该没事
Maybe they're right.

374
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,257
至少… 至少狗是人类最忠实的朋友
Maybe... Maybe old Shaw is crazy.

375
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:06,453
不会
Yeah, maybe.

376
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:18,775
郊外好宁静哦，巴伯
Isn't it peaceful out here, Bob?

377
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,107
你说得对，不要一直说话 破坏了这美好安详的一刻
You're right, Bob. Let's not spoil the beauty of this moment...

378
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,507
有些人就是爱碎碎念
...with idle chatter.

379
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,342
对牛弹琴弹到牛都不想听了
Some people can just jibber-jabber till the cows come home.

380
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,953
这是什么意思啊？ “对牛弹琴”
What does that mean, Bob? "Till the cows come home."

381
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,418
牛会听音乐吗？
Where have the cows been?

382
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:46,328
听好，森林小学第一课
Okay, Forest 101.

383
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:48,596
那一根根高大的木头叫做树木
These big wood stick things are called trees.

384
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:54,337
超巨大的岩石叫做山 那些小石头是山的宝宝
The big rocks are called mountains, and the little rocks are their babies.

385
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,513
惧高症
Altitude.

386
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,416
不能软脚，不能软脚 加油
No jelly arm, no jelly arm. Come on.

387
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,546
-爱鹿特 -布谷侠，这…
- Elliot! - Boogster, it's...

388
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:09,055
要我说多少遍你才了解
How many times must I say it?

389
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,751
我叫做超人特攻鹿
I am the Incredible Mister E.

390
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,328
救我
Elliot, please.

391
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,556
天啊，如果你不用化名叫我的话
Look, if you don't use the code names...

392
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:18,826
我怎么知道 在跟我说话的到底是不是你啊！
...how am I supposed to know that it's really you that I'm talking to?

393
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:34,309
没事…没问题了
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I got it.

394
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,782
轻轻的，慢慢来
Nice and easy.

395
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:42,087
你就给我一个痛快，快拔吧
Just rip it off fast, like a Band-Aid.

396
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,988
乖乖不要动，好吗？
Hold still, okay?

397
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,789
你冷静一点，可能会有点痛
Just be calm. This might pinch a little.

398
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:50,992
-快拔啦 -我劝你最好捂住耳朵
- Get it over with. - You may wanna cover your ears.

399
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:52,362
捂住什么…？
Cover my--?

400
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:58,941
好了，快窜回森林里去吧，兄弟
Okay, scamper on back to the woods, little buddy.

401
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:02,701
兄弟
Buddy.

402
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,747
听好，你们这些娘们 老天不会帮你们盖水
Okay, ladies, this dam ain't gonna build itself!

403
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,248
抬起桦树，把那批松木弄过来
Lift that birch. Swing those pines over here.

404
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:10,215
快，动作快
Come on. Move it!

405
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:11,649
阿土
Yo, O'Toole!

406
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:14,222
-是，老大 -我要你把柏木呈斜角方向
- Yeah, boss? - I want you to cantilever that cedar...

407
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:18,020
固定在北端的横梁上 懂不懂啊？
...on the bias down by the north end, you got that?

408
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,226
把木梢插进去
Put a twig in the hole.

409
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:23,055
菜鸟
Rookie.

410
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,291
放饭时间五分钟
Take five for lunch!

411
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:29,134
-你吃什么？ -木头
- What do you got? - Wood.

412
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:31,797
-你吃什么？ -木头
- What do you got? - Wood.

413
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,840
要交换吗？
You wanna trade?

414
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,035
兄弟们，你们看
Hey, hey, guys. Check it out.

415
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:40,274
那是北美体型最大的肉食性动物
There goes the largest carnivore in North America.

416
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,250
-最威猛的大熊 -同时他还是舞王
- The mighty grizzly. - And he's a good dancer.

417
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,854
我们有自己的秀
We're gonna be in a show.

418
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,589
走了啦
Come here!

419
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:53,853
我只剩这根鹿角了
Hey, that's my good antler.

420
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:57,100
听好，呆头 没有所谓的我们，只有我
Listen, simple. We are not "we."

421
00:33:57,267 --> 00:34:00,759
而我们不会一起作秀
It's just me. And we ain't doing no show.

422
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,303
-大牌 -什么？
- Diva. - What?

423
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:03,996
我了解现在什么状况了
I understand what's going on here.

424
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:06,233
你这么气嘟嘟是因为你饿了
You're a little crabby because you're hungry.

425
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,843
我…
I, I...

426
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,941
我不会错的
I think yes.

427
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,311
我饿得快死了
I'm starving!

428
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:17,385
-来，试试看 -我不才吃素里
- Here, try this. - I can't eat that.

429
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,454
挑食、挑嘴、偏食
Picky, picky, picky.

430
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,557
不然熊都吃什么？
Well, what do bears eat?

431
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:28,163
吃鱼，熊是吃鱼的
Fish. Bears eat fish.

432
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:33,430
好了，鱼儿们，过来喂饱布谷
All right, fishies, give it up for Boog!

433
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:36,367
你讲啥？ 阿搭妈秀斗…

434
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:53,253
超人特攻鹿
Hey, Incredible Mister E.

435
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:55,789
什么事？布谷侠
Yes, Boogster?

436
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:59,486
-我要嗯嗯 -那就…嗯啊
- I gotta go. - Well, go.

437
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,654
不行，我需要马桶啦
No, I need a toilet.

438
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,796
就是蛋糕盆…方便坑
You know, the think tank.

439
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,461
霜淇淋洞，堆…堆肥水池
The log cabin, the johnny on the spot, the oval office.

440
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,004
-荒郊野外没有那些东西 -那你都怎么嗯？
- There's none of those things out here. - Well, what do you do?

441
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:14,700
我都是…
You know...

442
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:18,037
就地取材 你听我说
...I can't remember. But listen.

443
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:23,983
不要想太多 你看那地方有个小树丛，是你专属的
Don't look now, but I see a little bush with your name written all over it.

444
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:25,781
小树丛，别闹了啦
A bush? Are you serious?

445
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,981
就像骑独轮车一样简单
Go on. It's just like riding a bicycle.

446
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:30,922
只要…习惯就好
Only you're crapping on it.

447
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:35,357
秀出你的嗯嗯脸，狂野小子
Show us your "grr" face, nature boy.

448
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:51,470
喂，你们看什么？
Hey. What are you doing here?

449
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:53,172
走开啦
Get out of here.

450
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,751
我正在嗯嗯 走开
I'm working here. Now, go.

451
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,318
好啦…你们玩够了
All right, all right, you've had your fun.

452
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:02,356
没什么好看的，让大熊做大蛋糕
Nothing to see here. Let the bear do his thing.

453
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,958
这有什么好看的？
You believe those guys?

454
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:08,795
嗯完没？
Finished?

455
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:11,291
我敢打赌那大胖子一定嗯不出来
I bet my nuts that big hairy choob can't do it.

456
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:14,801
-我跟你一样赌他嗯不出来 -你们这些动物都有什么毛病？
- I'll take a piece of that action. - What is wrong with you animals?

457
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,268
给他灌肠吧，兄弟
Perhaps some roughage, buddy?

458
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,668
兄弟
Buddy.

459
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,069
给我一点隐私好不好？
Perhaps some privacy.

460
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,642
-你跑到我家来冲啥？ -这是你家？
- What are doing on my house? - This is your house?

461
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,040
我…我不知道
Oh, I-- I didn't know...

462
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:26,011
-你家可能较漂亮哦 -你在说什么五四三
- It would be an improvement. - What did you just say, Rosie?

463
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,208
没有啦，你干嘛这么神经质
Nothing. Why you gotta be so sensitive?

464
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:30,683
-布谷侠，你在磨蹭什么？ -你嘴巴放干净一点
- Boogster, what's the deal? - You watch your mouth...

465
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,651
不然我会让你看不到明天的日头
...or you'll get yourself in trouble.

466
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,950
你就是眼红 偶有男人疼惜啦
You're just jealous because you ain't got a man.

467
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,525
有两个赤扒扒在吵架
I don't know. Some kind of chick fight.

468
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,193
爱鹿特，我该怎么办
Elliot, what do I do?

469
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,762
这个简单 你只要划出你的地盘
Well, that's easy. You just gotta mark your territory.

470
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,264
-告诉她们谁是老大 -好了，小姐们
- Show them who's boss. - All right, ladies.

471
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,834
现在由我当家
I'm laying down the law.

472
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:49,403
当然碰到臭鼬就快闭嘴
Unless, of course, they're skunks.

473
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:52,373
臭牟牟
Disgusting.

474
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:00,710
吉赛儿
Giselle.

475
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:03,679
太夸张了
Ridiculous.

476
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:11,024
整座森林居然容不下一头熊
The woods is no place for a bear.

477
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,188
鸭子
Ducks? Okay.

478
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:14,762
不要动
Look, don't move.

479
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:19,929
好个移花接木
Oh, yeah. Sprucing up.

480
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:23,038
快，你们一定要帮我
Quick. You guys gotta help me.

481
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:26,909
不要怪丹尼，先生 他有一点紧张
Don't mind Deni, monsieur. He's a bit nervous.

482
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,011
他从来没有…怎么说呢？
Never been quite...

483
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:33,815
正常过 自从大迁徙以后他就这样了
...right since the great migration.

484
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:39,246
我们好几千只野鸭子 排成V字飞行中队
There were thousands of us when we started in the big V's.

485
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:43,322
后来…太可怕，就出事了
Then... Then it happened.

486
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,222
出了什么事了？
What happened?

487
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:48,831
什么事？ 打猎季节开始了
What happened? Open season happened.

488
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:51,428
只有我跟丹尼活下来
Just me and Deni were left.

489
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:55,002
两只鸭子怎么排成V字飞行中队？
How can you make a V with only two duck, you ask, eh?

490
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,633
根本就不可能嘛
Well, you cannot, monsieur.

491
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,867
真是太悲惨了
It's a tragedy!

492
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,869
对…好惨
Yeah, right, whatever.

493
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,311
是这样子的，我要回村里
But check this out. I'm looking for town.

494
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:09,646
能不能请你们飞到天上去
Okay? Now, could one of you guys fly up there...

495
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:12,447
-帮我带个路？ -飞行…飞行
- ...and show me the way? - Fly? Fly?

496
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,655
别吵，他会听到
Quiet. They'll hear you.

497
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,188
吉赛儿
Giselle.

498
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:20,295
-爱鹿特 -小美人，你好吗？
- Elliot? - Hey, gorgeous.

499
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:23,296
爱鹿特，你跑哪去了？
- How you doing? - Elliot, where have you been?

500
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,991
我去…大城市
Oh, you know. Big city.

501
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:29,661
闯盆江湖，增广见闻 大鱼大肉，作秀爆红
Kind of a road trip. Saw the sights, hit the buffet, took in a show.

502
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,363
前途一片光明
Things are looking up, Giselle.

503
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,101
真的？听说你被卡车撞了
Really? I heard you got hit by a truck.

504
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:37,844
那是谣言
That-- Rumor.

505
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:40,482
你最好快点溜 还记得你上次
You better get out of here. Remember what happened...

506
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,845
-跟我说话死得有多难看？ -伊恩在附近？
- ...last time you talked to me? - Is Ian around?

507
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:48,651
你这样抽搐多久了？
How long have you had that tic?

508
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,517
越来越恶化了
I think it's getting worse.

509
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,056
糗大了
Oh, crud.

510
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,931
你好啊，臭鹿特
Hello, "Smelliot."

511
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:04,039
我都叫他臭鹿特
I called him Smelliot.

512
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:08,399
兄弟们，正圆围攻阵
Herd! Circle formation!

513
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,771
群天兵，那是椭圆
You pinheads. That's an oval.

514
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:14,712
再…圆一点
More circle-y!

515
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:17,544
你还真有种敢回来这里
You got a lot of nerve coming back here.

516
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:21,054
-谢谢夸奖 -我不是在夸奖你，孬种
- Why, thank you. - That was not a compliment, maggot!

517
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:23,124
他正要离开了 对吧，爱鹿特
Well, he was just going. Right, Elliot?

518
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:24,555
对…伊恩
Yeah, Ian.

519
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:28,255
我…我只是顺道过来 跟几个老朋友打个招呼
I had to stop by and say hello to some of my old pals.

520
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:30,422
包伯、凯文、席丹 额头好点没？
Bob, Kevin. Jurgen, how's the knee?

521
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,934
我将你逐出家门 永远…
I told you to leave the herd and never, ever, ever...

522
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:38,734
-永远？ -永远…永远不准回来
- Never? - Never, ever, ever come back.

523
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,432
回来？
Back?

524
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,775
我没…没要回来
I'm not-- I'm not back.

525
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,608
我…我和我的好哥儿们要去山林村
Me and my best buddy are heading to town.

526
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:49,047
对啊，我一定会想念你们的
Yeah. I sure am gonna miss you guys.

527
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,516
放开你的臭蹄子
Off the upholstery!

528
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:53,621
又怎么了？
What now?

529
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:03,927
就像我刚才说的，永远…
So as I was saying, never, ever, ever--

530
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,463
熊…
A bear! Bear. Bear. A bear.

531
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,865
爱鹿特，你还好吧？
Elliot, are you all right?

532
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,771
头昏昏，脑钝钝
Buttermilk biscuit.

533
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:16,468
伊恩，他还背娃娃耶
Hey, Ian. Get a load of this.

534
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,045
快住手
Hey, cut it out.

535
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:20,580
我听过你哦
Oh, I've heard of you.

536
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:25,653
你是被松鼠K得满头包的大笨熊
You're that bear that got his butt thumped by a squirrel.

537
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,850
他们有好几百只耶
It was-- There was 20 of them.

538
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,659
他们还有松果耶
And they had nuts.

539
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,353
不要理他，布谷
Don't listen to him, Boog.

540
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:37,398
布谷？ 是什么鬼名字？
Boog? What is that short for?

541
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,797
-布谷鸟吗？ -布谷鸟
- Booger? - Booger!

542
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:43,302
-给我听好 -我是在听啊
- Listen, you! - I'm all ears.

543
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,138
-我…这个… -布谷，我们走啦
- Well... - Boog, let's go.

544
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:50,377
你们两个真是天生的绝配
You two are perfect for each other.

545
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:54,813
你是衰ㄎㄚ，而你是大西瓜
You're a loser and you're a loser-er.

546
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,775
兄弟们，我们走
Herd, let's bound!

547
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,217
臭鹿特
Hey, Elliot.

548
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,858
你的那根掉了哦
I think you lost something.

549
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,386
也许会长回来的，拜，爱鹿特
Maybe it'll grow back. Bye, Elliot.

550
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:07,825
拜了
Yeah, see you.

551
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:11,990
后会有期了，大胖熊宝宝
See you later, backpack boy!

552
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:17,164
这就对了，叫你落跑吧
That's right, fool. You better run.

553
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,740
跑远一点啊，没种的娘娘腔
Keep on prancing, you panty-waisted cow.

554
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,900
对，他再废话，我就要开扁了
Yeah. One more word, and I was gonna rack him.

555
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:23,773
-没错 -我超想扁他，你看看他
- That's right. - I was waiting for it.

556
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,175
吓死了，吓得屁滚尿流
He's scared. He's scared.

557
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:27,646
对啊，就是啊
- Look at him run. Look at him run. - Yeah, I know it.

558
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,148
放他一马吧
Look at him go.

559
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:31,719
你请他喝一杯前要不要亲他一下？
Are you not gonna buy him a drink before you kiss him?

560
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:34,322
你们这对好姐妹
You big jessie.

561
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,761
给我滚啦，衰ㄎㄚ，大西瓜
On your bikes, you big numpties.

562
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:16,021
刚才那是伊恩的女友，你想把她？
That was Ian's girl you was trying to talk to, huh?

563
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,196
小色鬼
You dog.

564
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:24,702
他说得对，我是个衰ㄎㄚ
Ian's right. I'm a loser.

565
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,466
-你才不是衰ㄎㄚ -明明就是
- No, you're not a loser. - Yes, I am.

566
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:28,372
-你不是 -我是
- No, you're not. - Yes.

567
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:32,140
相信我 遇见你那天，伊恩把我赶出家门
Trust me. You know the day I met you, Ian kicked me out of the herd.

568
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:36,149
鹿角断了一根，被车撞昏 还被人绑在引擎盖上
I lost my antler, I got run over and tied to the hood of a truck.

569
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,650
你说那叫什么？
What do you call that?

570
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:41,720
衰ㄎㄚ… 那我呢？
A loser. But check this out.

571
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:44,416
掌声欢迎最威猛的大熊
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

572
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:46,926
我长得像熊，说话像熊
I look like a bear, I talk like a bear.

573
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:50,725
我却不会抓鱼，也不会爬树 连待在森林都不会
But I can't fish, I can't climb a tree, I can't even go in the woods.

574
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,495
那算什么？ 我像驴，又像鹿，我四不像
That's nothing. Half doe. Half buck. I'm a duck.

575
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:56,366
我骑着独轮车跟人要饼干
Hey, I ride a unicycle for crackers!

576
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:58,666
-我眼袋很大 -我不会弹手指
- I have a glass eye. - I can't snap.

577
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,777
-我以为手机是鸡 -我胖到看不到小弟弟
- I thought "log" was a color. - I can't see my feet.

578
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:04,345
人是我杀的
I killed a man.

579
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:15,981
至少你还有家可以回
Well, at least you've got a home.

580
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:18,891
家…
Home. Yeah.

581
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:21,155
但愿回得了家
I sure hope so.

582
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,966
-这什么声音，你的脖子吗？ -不是
- Crimenently! Was that your neck? - No.

583
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:31,269
我的小鱼饼干，她还是爱我的
My fishy crackers. Oh, she still loves me.

584
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,068
谢谢你，贝丝
Thank you, Beth.

585
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,177
我要回去！
I'm coming home.

586
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:39,272
吃吧，哥儿们
Try one, partner. Yeah.

587
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:42,282
虽然没有哇塞棒好吃 但可安慰你
Woo Hoo bars they ain't, but they take you back.

588
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:44,147
让你想到家的温暖
You know? Remind you of home.

589
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,982
甜甜咸咸的家
Sweet, salty home.

590
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:55,028
可以回到又软又蓬松的床上
Oh, yeah. To be back in my own soft bed.

591
00:43:55,832 --> 00:44:00,098
一天可以吃八餐，外加点心
Eight square meals a day, plus snacks.

592
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,170
贝丝每晚都可以哄我入睡
Beth tucking me in every night.

593
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:05,039
那里是我的天堂
It's like heaven to me.

594
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:12,142
对了…明天一回到村里
You know, when we get back home tomorrow...

595
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:15,011
我一定会跟贝丝和好如初
...I'm gonna make things right with Beth.

596
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:18,915
也许只是也许
And maybe, just maybe...

597
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,225
可以在车库里弄个地方让你窝着
...we'll find a place for you in the garage with me.

598
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:26,385
赞啦 我要车库
Sweet! Oh, yeah. I'm in the garage.

599
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,622
谁要车库… 我要车库，就是我
Who's staying in the garage? I'm in the garage.

600
00:44:28,798 --> 00:44:31,631
谁要车库… 我要车库，就是我
Who's got a place in the garage? It's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah--

601
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,530
-哥儿们 -啥事啊？
- Hey, buddy? - Yeah?

602
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:38,766
帮个忙好不好 我有一点不太好意思说
Do me a favor, will you? It's gonna sound silly, but will you--?

603
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,375
-你可以…算了 -快说啦
- Ah, forget it. - What?

604
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:42,170
快说啦，我挺你，老哥
Come on. I'm here for you.

605
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:46,441
你…你可以唱一下 “泰迪熊野餐”给我听吗？
Will you sing me that "teddy-bear picnic" song?

606
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:49,744
当然…可以，什么歌？
Absolutely. The what song?

607
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:53,218
贝丝每天都会唱给我听的 她一唱我就睡着了
Well, Beth always sings it to me, you know, because it helps me sleep.

608
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:57,382
-好吧，那我就来试试看 -谢啦
- Okay. I'll give it a shot. - Thanks.

609
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:03,028
从前有个神秘矮人 他住在彩虹树里
<i>Once there was a magical elf Who lived in a rainbow tree</i>

610
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,724
他楼上住着便秘侏儒
<i>He lived downstairs From a flatulent dwarf</i>

611
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:07,802
每天都对楼下放屁
<i>Who was constantly having to pee</i>

612
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,462
有天矮人受不了了
<i>One day the elf could take no more</i>

613
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,131
跑到楼上敲侏儒的门
<i>So he went and banged On the rude dwarf's door</i>

614
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:18,906
结果没想到他们居然公证结婚
<i>And what do you know They suddenly both were married</i>

615
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,551
晚安，布谷
Good night, Boog.

616
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:32,587
我有车库可以睡了 我要睡在车库里
I'm sleeping in the garage. I'm sleeping in the garage.

617
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,499
快啊，腊肠先生 你做得到哦，加油
Come on, Mr. Weenie. Beg. You can do it.

618
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,797
加油，拜拜
Come on. Beg.

619
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:46,271
巴伯他不听话 巴伯教他怎么拜拜
Bob, he won't listen. Bob, show him how to beg.

620
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:00,822
是拜狗教徒
Dog worship.

621
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,186
妈啊
Oh, my!

622
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,192
-你们没事吧？ -什么？不…
- You folks all right? - What? No, no, no! He's--

623
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,886
他绑架了你们，我知道…
Taken you hostage. I know, I know.

624
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:10,225
你们获救了，我制伏了敌人
You're safe now. I've got the enemy neutral--

625
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,594
好了，腊肠先生 没事了，宝贝
There, there, Mr. Weenie. Are you all right, baby?

626
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,401
你是天底下最可爱的腊肠狗
You're the sweetest little weenie I ever saw.

627
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,709
不要再傻了，他们是一伙的
Don't be fooled. He's one of them.

628
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:27,814
-谁？ -敌人啊，笨熊、笨鹿
- Who? - The enemy! The bear! That deer!

629
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:29,383
所有的动物
All them animals!

630
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:32,653
我已经预见未来了
I have seen the future.

631
00:46:32,822 --> 00:46:37,054
就从山林村这种小镇开始肆虐
It will start in small towns like Timberline.

632
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:40,457
很快就天下大乱
<i>Soon, it'll spread.</i>

633
00:46:41,664 --> 00:46:47,364
所有的动物全部倾巢而出 从洞穴、动物园
<i>They will invade from burrows, caves, petting zoos.</i>

634
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,463
如果我不阻止他们
If I don't stop them...

635
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:56,101
人类就要被他们踩在脚下了
...it'll be a total reversal of the natural order.

636
00:46:56,279 --> 00:47:01,216
他们会嘲笑我无能 等着瞧吧
They laugh at old Shaw, but you'll see.

637
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:04,820
真相早晚会大白的
The truth will be revealed.

638
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:08,218
我们听懂你的话了
We know exactly what you mean.

639
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:11,360
-真的？ -我们是科学家，可以算是吧
- You do? - We're scientists. Well, of sorts.

640
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:14,394
我们想要拍栩栩如生的纪录片
And we're trying to secure photographic documentation...

641
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:17,931
拍活生生的野生大人猿
...of a real, live homo-sasquatchus.

642
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,195
-野…野生什么？ -我们要去找大脚怪
- Homo-say-what? - We're looking for Bigfoot.

643
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:27,568
大脚… 我居然跟两个头壳坏掉疯子哈啦
Bigfoot--? I didn't realize I was talking to a couple of wack jobs.

644
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:33,404
不要相信他 宠物是双面间谍
Don't trust him. Pets are double agents.

645
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:37,417
只要你稍不注意 他就会咬你
The moment you turn your back, he'll shiv you!

646
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:42,857
不可能，我们收服他了
Oh, no, he can't. We had him fixed.

647
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:46,523
布谷
Boog?

648
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:50,895
布谷，你醒了吗？
Boog. Are you awake?

649
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:53,699
-现在醒了 -太好了
- I am now. - Awesome.

650
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:58,330
我昨晚看到你的睡相了耶 你就像个小天使
I was watching you sleep last night and you were like a little angel.

651
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,534
不过你太胖，打呼声好像…
Except for you're fat and snoring like:

652
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:07,305
我会帮你解决问题的
We're gonna work on that, though.

653
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:10,043
我发明了打呼疗法 把整只手
I invented this cure where you stick your whole hand...

654
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,744
-塞进嘴巴里就好了 -要多久才能回到山林村？
- ...in your mouth. - How long before we get to Timberline?

655
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:16,085
天黑以前，安啦
Oh, by nightfall. Easy.

656
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:17,624
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

657
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,694
当然确定了
Absolutely.

658
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:22,524
想不想看我搞笑？
Hey, you wanna see something stupid?

659
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,401
我觉得我们最好快点赶路
Well, then we better get going.

660
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,903
对，我们要赶时间 这个我帮你保管
Right. We're on a tight schedule. I'll carry your load.

661
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:32,768
不…等等
Oh, no. Whoa, wait.

662
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:36,503
你最好小心一点，不要弄掉了 因为他是很脆弱的
Look, you gotta be real careful with him, okay, because he's real delicate.

663
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:41,709
想吃小鱼饼干吗？
Want a fishy cracker?

664
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:47,047
不想，回家再吃好了
No. I'll eat when I get home.

665
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:49,682
听着，好姐妹
Listen, girlfriend.

666
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,726
想要找到像偶男朋友那种男子汉 就要打扮得漂亮一点
You wanna find a man like my Ignacio, you gotta check your look.

667
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:55,693
黑白讲，偶美得冒泡 我可以把到所有的男子汉
What are you saying? I'm black and white. I go with everything.

668
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:58,265
问题出在所有的男子汉 都不想把你
You go fine with everybody. Maybe that's your problem.

669
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:01,460
-那不是昨天那两只臭到爆的 -我有几个作秀好点子
- Ain't those the same two skunks-- - I had some thoughts on the show.

670
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:03,696
-我的秀？ -热裤妞过时了
- My show? - The lady in the shorts has gotta go.

671
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:07,400
她是票房毒药 节目要够酷、够炫、热情够劲
She's slowing us down. It's gotta be fresh, new. I want some jazz.

672
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,740
我才是主秀 观众买票是来看我的
I'm the star, and the people out there come to see me...

673
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:12,278
威猛大熊
...a grizzly bear.

674
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,282
原来如此
I see.

675
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:20,479
你有你的事业 我就得待在家里照顾小布丁
You get to have the career while I stay home and look after Dinkleman!

676
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:22,749
我又不是你老婆
He's not even mine!

677
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:26,389
我就不能去追逐梦想，是不是？
I don't get to have a dream. Is that it?

678
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,626
兄弟
Buddy.

679
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:35,331
你有没有想过 也许我喜欢唱歌
Don't you think I might like a little singing...

680
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:38,132
-喜欢跳舞，来点… -爱鹿特
- ...a little dancing, a little: - Elliot.

681
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:42,437
没有嘛，你只会一直问我 “要多久才能回到山林村？呆头”
But no. All I ever hear is, "How long until we get to Timberline, simple?

682
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,547
-“要多少才能…” -爱鹿特，那是同一群水獭吗？
- How long until we get home?" - Elliot! Are those the same beavers?

683
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:50,618
-不是，水獭长得都一样 -青蛙王子
- No. All beavers look alike. - Hey! Tiny dancer!

684
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:53,016
好耶，摇咧摇咧…
Yeah, that's right! Shake it, shake it!

685
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,154
-秀给我们看嘛 -爱鹿特
- Let's see some moves! - Elliot!

686
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:57,417
干嘛？
Yeah.

687
00:49:57,593 --> 00:50:01,893
爱鹿特，又是那一座带衰水 我们一直在绕圈子
Elliot, this is the same dang dam. We've been going in circles!

688
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:04,965
圈子，一次绕一圈
Circle. One time around.

689
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:07,830
你根本就不知道哪里是哪里
You don't even know where we're going.

690
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:12,301
帅啊，箩琳
Got them, Lorraine!

691
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:22,510
-那是什么 -猎人
- What was that? - Hunters?

692
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:27,145
-他们跑来上游干嘛？ -好了，兄弟们，找掩护
- What are they doing up here? - Okay, boys. Take cover!

693
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:32,458
-布谷，快躲起来 -我先走一步
- Boog, we gotta hide. - I'm out of here.

694
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:35,256
布谷，等等，不要踩上去
Boog, wait! Don't go out there!

695
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:39,595
大胖子，你站住 你那么大一只会踩垮水蔚睦
Hey, tubby, stop! Hey, this ain't a load-bearing structure!

696
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,970
糗爆了
Oh, that's bad.

697
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,313
箩西，快躲起来
Rosie, in here.

698
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:12,658
-走开，放手 -兄弟…
- Stop. Get off. - Buddy, buddy, buddy!

699
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:14,564
惨了
Crud.

700
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:29,614
煞星
Shaw!

701
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:35,681
小布丁
Dinkleman!

702
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:41,123
你不会有事的
You're gonna be okay!

703
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:44,289
我们死定了，你明知道的
We're gonna die and you know it.

704
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,939
这一次没有人能够救得了你们了
No one around here to save you this time, boys!

705
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,938
划，布谷，快划
Paddle, Boog! Paddle!

706
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:00,509
前面有大石头…
Grab a boulder! Grab a boulder!

707
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:03,413
左边…右边
Left, left. Right!

708
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:05,443
你好神哦
Oh, like you know.

709
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:12,956
他人呢
Where is he?

710
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,893
不见了 又见了
He's gone. Oh, there he is.

711
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,159
不见了 又见了
No, wait. There he is. There he is.

712
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,069
-你这个小王八… -他在那里
- Why, you little-- - There he is.

713
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:22,727
别吵，我在驾驶
Quiet, I'm trying to drive.

714
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,507
快点，布谷
Faster, Boog!

715
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,649
这好像一边打猎一边钓鱼
Like fishing and hunting at the same time.

716
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:52,398
-拉我一把，布谷快抱住我，布谷 -放开我，爱鹿特
- Give me a hand, Boog! Hold me! - Stop. Get off! Elliot, get off. Get off!

717
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,325

-你要我们躲去哪里？ -我们是煮熟的鸭子了

726
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:15,175
没错，爱鹿特，这都要怪你

要不是你 我现在就会待在家里

这一切就不会发生
None of this would've ever happened.

730
00:54:21,223 --> 00:54:24,021
你还说你知道回去的路 可是你耍我

我以为只要我们混在一起 你就会喜欢我
I thought if you hung out with me then maybe you would like me.

735
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,471
天啊，亏我这么相信你
Oh, man. I trusted you, Elliot.

736
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:40,700
对不起，布谷，我…
I'm sorry, Boog.

737
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:43,168
还是好哥儿们，对吗？
We're still partners, right?

738
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:46,109
不必了，我还是自己走吧
You know, Elliot, I'm better off alone.

739
00:54:47,816 --> 00:54:49,249
那我们呢？
What about us?

740
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:51,386
-对啊，那我们呢？ -别这样嘛…

741
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,715

Us? There's no us.

742
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:57,290
那是你家的事 至于你，我们完了

你还好吧
You okay?

748
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,896
我把他送去瀑布上游
I put him way above the falls.

749
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,427
但愿我这么做是对的
I hope I did the right thing.

750

你放心，贝丝 布谷待在新家会很快乐的

心爱的蛋糕盆
Oh, sweet porcelain.

756

观众也为他疯狂
And the crowd goes wild!

757
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:36,814
这屋子里一定会有冰箱
Now, there's gotta be a fridge in here somewhere.

758
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,187

全被那只笨熊给带坏了
That bear's turned them all.

763
00:58:56,632 --> 00:59:01,228
坐一下，宝贝箩琳 舒服的休息吧
Here you go, Lorraine. There, you get good and dry.

764
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:05,305
一大早我们还要去打击犯罪呢
Come morning, we got a rebellion to crush.

765
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:09,300
然后夺回属于我的一切
And then I'm gonna take back what's mine!

766
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:11,469
爱鹿特
Elliot.

767
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,017
有人吃掉了我的糖

有人坐过了我的椅子

769
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:37,337
有人忘了冲马桶

00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:45,041
他现在还在这里
And he's still here.

771

来找你的小矮人啊，白雪公主
Come back for your bear, Goldilocks?

772
00:59:56,091 --> 01:00:01,996
你完蛋，因为我来了
Ready or not, here I come!

773
01:00:07,669 --> 01:00:14,438
如果你今天跑进森林 会碰到个大惊喜
<i>If you go out in the woods today You're sure of a big surprise</i>

774
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:23,174
如果你今天跑进森林 你最好伪装自己
<i>If you go out in the woods today You better go in disguise</i>

775
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,114
因为森林里每一只熊
<i>'Cause every bear That ever there was</i>

776
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:33,025
都会在这里聚在一起
<i>Was gathered there Together because</i>

777

因为今天是熊宝宝的
<i>Today's the day The teddy bears have</i>

778

野餐日
<i>Their picnic!</i>

779
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:14,996
笨熊，你绝对逃不出我的手掌心
Hey, bear! There ain't nowhere that you can hide from me!

780
01:01:23,345 --> 01:01:25,142

啊，来啊，谁怕谁
All right! Bring it! Bring it!

789
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:47,989

790
01:02:48,163 --> 01:02:49,596
你跑回来做什么？

拜托，没有好哥儿们我回不了家
Come on. I couldn't go home without my partner.

792
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,991
-我才没有哥儿们 -爱鹿特
- I don't have a partner. - Elliot.

793
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:57,297
我不需要鹿群，我也不需要你

不要来烦我
So leave me alone.

795
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:02,003
这点我可能做不到
Ain't gonna be able to do it.

796
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:04,202
因为我已经救了你一命
You see, I already saved you once.

797
01:03:04,379 --> 01:03:08,406
我要负起责任来…保护你
That makes me responsible for you.

798
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:12,178
别装了 我要你亲口说“好哥儿们”
I saw that. Come on. Let me hear you say it. Partners.

799
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:14,447

806
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:36,307
-安全？ -安全？

807
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:43,140
布谷 你车库里可以挤得下多少动物？

809
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,811

815
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:08,065
把你们都害得这么惨 对不起，是我的错
And how I messed you all up, you know. My bad.

816
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:11,838
听着，你要带我们一起走，布谷鸟
So you're taking us with you, right, Booger?

817
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:14,811

Please? Please.

818
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:19,682
看看我 我长太帅，死了可惜啊
Look at me. I'm too pretty to die!

819
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:22,422
这个嘛…也许
Well, maybe...

820
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:26,184
不行…不可以…
No! No! No!

821
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:28,192
你不能丢下偶们
You ain't leaving without us.

822
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:29,990
我不会再叫你布谷鸟
I didn't mean to call you Booger.

823
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:33,862
-兄弟，可以带吉赛儿去好吗？ -等一等…让我想一想
- Can we take Giselle? - Wait! Let me think.

824

猎人
Hunters.

825
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:41,035
可恶，今天晚上谁都别想回家了
Dang. Nobody's going home tonight.

826
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:42,836
他们人太多了
There's so many of them.

827
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:45,138
这下死定了
That's it, then.

828
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:47,577
我要死了
No more me.

829
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,950
我的头要挂在墙壁上了
I guess I will be mounted on a wall.

830
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:59,156
放心，你不会
Oh, no, you won't.

831
01:04:59,327 --> 01:05:01,818
如果我变成了熊皮地毯 也许会让人践踏
Now, when I'm a bearskin rug, they can walk all over me.

832
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:05,091
可是我现在还活着 我要跟他们拼了，绝不投降
But until that happens, I ain't going out without a fight.

833
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:06,595
-什么…？ -他说什么…？
- What? - Fight?

834
01:05:06,768 --> 01:05:08,929
-他糊涂了 -没错
- The F word? - That's right.

835
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:10,731
这就是你们教会我的一件事
One thing you all have taught me...

836
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:14,438
这座森林危机四伏，危险得要命
...the woods is a messed-up, dangerous place.

837
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:19,979
你们超疯狂的 这两天你们把我整得超惨的
And y'all are crazy. You've been kicking my butt for the last two days.

838
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,538
对啊，有一点
Yeah, I kind of did.

839
01:05:21,716 --> 01:05:22,944
不好意思
- I didn't. - Sorry.

840
01:05:23,118 --> 01:05:25,450
你们要用对我的招数 对付他们
So let's do to them what you've been doing to me.

841
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,112
让我们的敌人享受 全套的大自然体验
Now, I say we give our guests the full outdoor experience.

842
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,020
万岁！
Yeah!

843
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:34,788
你想要单打独斗，还是全体大作战？
Hey! Is this a private fight or can anybody join?

844
01:05:34,963 --> 01:05:37,158
因为我妙酷鼠想要参一脚
Because McSquizzy wants in.

845
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,100
很好，我们需要你们的胆量
Good. Because we'll need your nuts.

846
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:42,862
-还有你们的松果 -你有什么计划，布谷？
- And your acorns too. - What's the plan, Boog?

847
01:05:43,038 --> 01:05:45,302
我们要把那些野人赶回村里
Oh, we gonna run those yahoos back to town.

848
01:05:45,473 --> 01:05:49,967
对，没错 把他们整死，再也不敢乱来
Yeah, baby. When we get through with them, they won't ever come back.

849
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:57,515
你以为你很厉害
So you think you're so tough, huh?

850
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:01,946
你给我听好
Well, you know what I think?

851
01:06:02,123 --> 01:06:05,889
在我眼里你只是熊宝宝
I think you're still just a mama's bear.

852
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:17,329
你负责留守，腊肠先生 妈咪要去凉一下
You guard the fort, Mr. Weenie. Mama's gonna take a dip.

853
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:22,138
太好了，我都快被她醺死了
That's good. Mama's getting kind of gamey.

854
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:26,110
快点，巴伯 今晚的月亮好圆好亮哦
Come on, Bob. There's gonna be a full moon out tonight.

855
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,682

It's empty.

860
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,341
