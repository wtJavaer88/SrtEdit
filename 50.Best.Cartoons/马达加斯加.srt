00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,760
不行的,我要是说了就会倒霉的
No siree. I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

145
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,197
你们想倒霉吗 那我就说了
You want some bad luck, I'll blab it out.

146
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,100
不过要是你想平安无事的话, 我一定不会说的
But if you want to be safe, I'll keep my mouth shut.

147
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,729
告诉我们吧 没什么大不了的
Would you just tell us? What could happen?

148
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,067
好吧
Okay.

149
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,440
我希望能到野外去！
I wished I could go to the wild!

150
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,739
野外？！
The wild?!

151
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,141
我告诉过你要倒霉的
I told you it was bad luck.

152
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,851
野外？你疯了吗？
The wild? Are you nuts?

153
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:26,015
这是我听到的最糟的想法
That is the worst idea I've ever heard.

154
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,817
那里不卫生的
It's unsanitary.

155
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,989
企鹅们要去那里 为什么我不可以？
The penguins are going. So why can't I?

156
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,589
那些企鹅都是神经病
The penguins are psychotic.

157
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,068
别这样. 想象一下回到大自然的感觉
Come on. Just imagine going back to nature.

158
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,130
回到你出生的地方 清洁的空气,广阔的空间
Back to your roots. Clean air, wide-open spaces!

159
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,675
我听说康乃狄格洲地方特宽敞
I hear there's wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

160
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:48,110
- 康乃狄格洲？ - 那你得去大中央车站做车
- Connecticut? - You got to go over to Grand Central.

161
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,445
然后搭乘北上的火车... 往北走？
Then you got to take the Metro-North train... north?

162
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,749
这么说可以坐火车了? 就假想一下吗
So one could take the train? Just hypothetically.

163
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,722
得了吧. 康乃狄格会给我们提供些什么？
Come on. What would Connecticut have to offer us?

164
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,691
- 莱姆关节炎 - 多谢,麦尔曼
- Lyme disease. - Thank you, Melman.

165
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,987
不,我只是想...
No, I just want...

166
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,995
野外是没有这些病的
There's none of this in the wild.

167
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,464
这病都是因为饮食过细引起的
This is a highly refined type of food thing

168
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,364
在外面是不会遇到的
that you do not find in the wild.

169
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,666
艾利克司,你不曾经也 期待比牛排更多的食物吗？
You ever thought there might be more to life than steak, Alex?

170
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,605
他可不是那个意思,孩子 不,不,不
He didn't mean that, baby. No, no, no.

171
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:19,542
你们不觉得不知道
Doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything

172
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:21,806
动物园外的生活很难受吗？
about life outside this zoo?

173
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,944
- 恩. 不难受 - 我也是
- Nuh-uh. Nope. - Mm-mm.

174
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,646
好吧,我意思是,算了吧 只是随便问问
Well, I mean, come on. That's just one subject.

175
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,449
你那有点脏 就在你的...
You got a little schmutz right there on your...

176
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:41,455
谢啦,伙计们 谢谢你们为我开的生日派对. 很不错
Thanks, guys. Thanks for the party. It was great.

177
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,761
真的
Really.

178
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,736
他到底怎么了？
What's eating him?

179
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,746
也许你应该和他谈谈 过去给他打打气
Maybe you should talk to him. Go over and give him a little pep talk.

180
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:59,682
嘿,我已经送给他一个雪晶球了. 不能再给了
Hey, I already gave him a snow globe. I can't top that.

181
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,920
我知道出什么事了
I can see where this is going.

182
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:06,620
时间不早了 我觉得我该...
It is getting late. I guess I'm going to...

183
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,195
快点. 他可是你最好的朋友
Come on. He's your best friend.

184
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,263
好吧,好吧
All right, all right. Okay.

185
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,935
- 晚安,马蒂 - 晚安,格洛
- Night, Marty. - Night, Glo.

186
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,595
多有意义的一天啊
What a day.

187
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:54,332
我意思是,跟你讲噢, 现在的生活最美好,明白吗？
I mean, I tell you, itjust doesn't get any better than this, you know?

188
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,769
噢,是真的. 连天上的星星都那么漂亮
Ooh! Ltjust did. Even the star's out.

189
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,811
在野外根本看不到这样美的星星
Not going to find a star like that in the wild.

190
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:03,905
那是直升飞机
Helicopter.

191
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,547
马蒂,伙计,听着
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

192
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,717
每个人都有觉得其它地方的草更绿的时候
Everybody has days when they think the grass might be greener somewhere else.

193
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,918
艾利克司
Alex.

194
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:17,256
看看我
Look at me.

195
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,321
我都十岁了 生命已经过半
I'm ten years old. My life is half over.

196
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,199
我甚至都不清楚 自己是黑底上带着白条纹
And I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes...

197
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,328
还是白底上带着黑条纹
...or white with black stripes.

198
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,238
马蒂
Marty.

199
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,645
我在想一首歌
I'm thinking of a song.

200
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,580
艾力刻丝,拜托,现在别唱歌
Alex. Please. Not now.

201
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,518
哦,当然,这是一首非常好听的歌 我想你一定很熟悉
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song. I think you're familiar with it.

202
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,749
哦,不,哦,不,你别唱 不,不,不要
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't. No, no, no.

203
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,349
我没在听
I'm not listening.

204
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,993
开始散播消息
Start spreadin' the news

205
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,156
我不认识你
I don't know you.

206
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,928
我今天要走了
I'm leaving today

207
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,700
- 我们是其中的重要的角色 - 这歌很有趣,是哪首呢？
- We are a great big part of it - He's funny. Who is that?

208
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,269
快. 你知道,你知道歌词的
Come on. You know you know the words.

209
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,436
两个很简单的词
Two little words.

210
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,706
纽约
New York.

211
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,406
纽约
New York

212
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,609
别唱了,住嘴,别唱了！ 嘿,我在睡觉！
Shut up, shut up, shut up! Hey, I'm sleeping here!

213
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,515
我们可不是夜猫子,明白！
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

214
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:17,146
我要把你练成夜猫子,朋友
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

215
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,452
好,就凭你和你的部下,带条纹的？
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

216
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,392
你找他麻烦 就是找我麻烦,胆小鬼
You mess with him, you mess with me, Howard.

217
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,124
- 你是只大嘴狮子 - 看到了吗？这可是性情暴虐的条纹将军
- You're a bigmouth lion. - See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

218
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,496
我们俩是最好的搭档, 就咱们俩
We make a great team, the two of us.

219
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,229
当然,绝对厉害
We sure do. No doubt about it.

220
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,898
好吧,你接下来要怎么做？ 一个人跑到荒野上去吗？
So, what are you going to do? Go running off to the wild by yourself?

221
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:35,997
- 不 - 太好了
- No. - Good.

222
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,701
你和我,一起去
You and me. Let's go.

223
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,902
-什么？ -一起去野外
- What? - The wild.

224
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,275
快点啦,你和我
Come on. You and me together.

225
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:44,782
我们可以一直沿着第五大街到大中央车站
It's a straight shot down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

226
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,841
然后搭上一班火车,往北走.
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

227
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,581
明天一早再赶回来 没人会知道的
We can be back by morning. No one will ever know.

228
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,885
你在开玩笑,对吧？
You're joking. Right?

229
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,459
对,我是在瞎说着玩的. 当然是在开玩笑. 让我歇会儿
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course I'm joking. Give me a break.

230
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,192
好象我们真要去搭车似的
Like we're going to get a train.

231
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,498
可别真那样做 你去那我会很担心的
Don't do that. You really had me worried there.

232
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,530
哦,好的. 我想去睡觉了
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

233
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,169
是呀,我也想了 我还得为了明天的演出好好休息休息嗓子
Yeah, me too. I'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow.

234
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:16,910
明天是退伍军人纪念日 得吼的大点声
It's Seniors' Day, you know. Have to roar extra loud.

235
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,815
给他们来点震撼的. 明白?
Give them a little jolt. You know?

236
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,020
晚安,艾利
Good night, AllyAI.

237
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,629
他们又忘了关掉渲染气氛的喇叭了
They forgot to turn off the ambience again.

238
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,794
别担心. 听起来还挺不错的
Don't worry. It's cool.

239
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,238
没关系,我来搞定它
You know, I got it.

240
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,070
这样就好多了
Much better.

241
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,437
快过来,现在,宝贝
Come on, now, baby.

242
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,599
我可爱的牛排
My little filet.

243
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,906
可爱的牛排,边上再来点肥肉
My little filet mignon with a little fat around the edges.

244
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:23,880
我喜欢那样,我喜欢带肥肉的牛排
I like that. I like a little fat on my steak.

245
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:28,249
美味多汁的牛排 你是难得的美味佳肴
My sweet, juicy steak. You are a rare delicacy.

246
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,050
艾利克司.艾利克司.艾利克斯
Alex. Alex. Alex!

247
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,420
怎么了?出什么事了?
What? What?

248
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,617
你在嘬手指?
You suck your thumb?

249
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,585
什么事呀,麦尔曼?
What is it, Melman?

250
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,562
你知道我得了尿毒症
You know how I have that bladder infection

251
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,495
而且还得每两个小时去趟厕所,对吧?
and I have to get up every two hours?

252
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:44,934
刚才我去小便的时候顺便看了一眼马蒂的窝 我以前从不看的
I got up to pee and looked over at Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

253
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,937
我不知道为什么,可就是看了,我发现...
I don't know why, but I did. And...

254
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,495
你发现什么了?到底发生了什么事?
What? What's going on?

255
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,370
我发现马蒂,他走了
It's Marty. He's gone.

256
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,104
走了!你什么意思?
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

257
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,840
看来他早有打算!
How long has he been working on this?

258
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,176
马蒂!
Marty!

259
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,614
马蒂!
Marty!

260
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,413
他根本钻不进去的
He wouldn't fit down there.

261
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,248
马蒂?马蒂!马蒂!
Marty? Marty! Marty!

262
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,914
这根本讲不通的 他会去哪里呢？
This doesn't make any sense. Where would he go?

263
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,486
- 康乃狄格洲! - 不会吧!
- Connecticut! - He wouldn't.

264
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,530
噢,天哪!我们该怎么办?
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

265
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,088
我的意思是,我们得报警
I mean, we got to call somebody!

266
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,805
你好?请赶快给我接动物走失处
Hello? Get me Missing Animals. And hurry.

267
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:25,604
有一匹斑马可能在去往康乃狄格洲的 路上走失了,我们需要...
We've got a lost zebra probably on the way to Connecticut, and we need...

268
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,777
- 喂?喂? - 等一下
- Hello? Hello? - Wait a second.

269
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,340
-我们不能给人类打电话 -这是怎...?
- We can't call the people. - What the...?

270
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:36,547
他们会气死的
They'll be really mad.

271
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:40,318
火车会把马蒂完整无损的送回来的 不要伤害曾经抚养过你的人
It'll get Marty transferred for good. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

272
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,825
恩,我明白这个理
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

273
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,453
我们得赶快把他追回来 他还没想明白呢
We got to go after him. He's not thinking straight.

274
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,498
让我们一起去阻止他犯下一生中最大的错误
Let's stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life.

275
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,697
他也许已经离开这里,迷了路, 感到寒冷和迷茫
He's probably out there lost and cold, confused.

276
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,367
可怜的小家伙
Poor little guy.

277
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:18,520
快点!
Come on.

278
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,065
我们其中一个人得留在这里以防他回来
One of us should wait here in case he comes back.

279
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,364
这次可不用,这是一次阻止行为 我们都得去
Not now. This is an intervention. We all got to go.

280
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,597
走那条路能最快到大中央车站呢？
What's the fastest way to Grand Central?

281
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,696
- 你们应该走莱克星顿大街 - 麦尔曼！
- You should take Lexington. - Melman!

282
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,335
- 好吧.“我们” 我们应该走莱克星顿大街 - 那走公园行吗?
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington. - What about Park?

283
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,004
不行,公园有两条路 等不起红绿灯的
No, Park goes two ways. You can't time the lights.

284
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,012
我听见Tom Wolfe在林肯中心讲话
I heard Tom Wolfe is speaking at Lincoln Center.

285
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,883
好的,我们一定要去把他给臭下来
Well, of course we're going to throw poo at him.

286
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:54,929
我们本应该走公园的
We should've taken Park.

287
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,128
你确定这是最快的一条路？
You sure this is the fastest way to Grand Central Station?

288
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,296
我不知道！ 是麦尔曼说的呀
I don't know! That's what Melman said.

289
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,930
嘿,嘿,你们这些家伙
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

290
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,738
那房间里有些精致的小盒子 可以在里面洗手的,看！
That room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in, and look!

291
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,506
免费薄荷糖！
Free mints!

292
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,012
这可不是实习旅行
This isn't a field trip.

293
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,607
而是一项挽救马蒂生活的紧急行动
This is an urgent mission to save Marty from throwing his life away.

294
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,174
好了,火车在哪里？
Now, where's the train?

295
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:15,947
车来了
Here it comes.

296
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,891
马蒂跟你说什么了？ 我让你和他谈过的
What did Marty say to you? I asked you to talk to him.

297
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,522
我谈了！谈了！可是听不懂 他说什么“一起走”
I did! I did! I don't understand. He said, "Let's go."

298
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,590
我说“你疯了吗?” 他然后说“我已经十岁了”
I said, "Are you crazy?" He says, "I'm ten years old."

299
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,468
还有什么他身上的黑白条纹, 然后我们就一起唱...
And he has black-and-white stripes, and so then we sang and...

300
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,277
你应该一直退回到西大街42号
What you got to do is go straight back down West 42nd.

301
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,542
就在你左手边范德比尔特楼后
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

302
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,881
要是你到了克莱斯勒大楼, 那就是走过头了
If you hit the Chrysler Building, you've gone too far.

303
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,477
谢谢你,长官
Thanks a lot, officer.

304
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,691
嘿,等绿灯亮了再走
Hey! Wait for the light.

305
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,783
怪物
Freak.

306
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,591
- 你刚才说“斑马”？ - 对呀,一匹斑马
- Did you say "zebra"? - That's right. A zebra.

307
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,096
就在我前面
Right in front of me.

308
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,689
- 我可以朝他开枪吗？ - 不行
- Can I shoot it? - Negative.

309
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,361
那我请求支援
Then I'm going to need some backup.

310
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,247
- 哦不！尼可队又输了 - 你有什么办法？
- Aw! Knicks lost again. - What are you going to do.

311
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:22,775
那上面写的是“大中央车站” 还是“我姑妈的便秘”呀？
Did that say "Grand Central Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

312
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:23,843
我们到了
This is it.

313
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,358
大中央车站
Grand Central Station.

314
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:31,862
这儿很大而且是中央
It's grand and it's central.

315
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,440
请往两边让一让, 我们有急事 情况紧急
Move aside. We have an emergency here. This is an emergency situation.

316
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,386
嘿,嘿.冷静点 没那么急的
Hey, hey. Just chill out. It's not that big of an emergency.

317
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,888
楼上,楼下
Upstairs, downstairs.

318
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:00,888
你感觉如何？
How do you like that?

319
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,627
夫人！你怎么回事？
Lady! What is wrong with you?

320
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,789
哦,控制一下自己的情绪吧,人类
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

321
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,357
你这只不听话猫
You're a bad kitty.

322
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,072
真不幸！刚错过一趟特快列车
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

323
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,041
看来我就只能做去斯坦福德的慢车了
Looks like I'll have to take the Stamford local.

324
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,872
我看到他了！我抓到他了！
I got him! I've got him!

325
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,037
他抓到他了！
He's got him!

326
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:23,342
他抓到他了！他抓到他了！ 他抓到...
He's got him! He's got him! He's got...

327
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,848
我给你带了点东西！
I got something for you!

328
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,949
我没事.不要紧
I'm okay. I'm okay.

329
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:32,489
哇！你们来这里干什么？
Whoa! What are you guys doing here?

330
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:36,323
- 真高兴找到你了 - 我们真是担心死你了
- I am so glad we found you. - We were so worried about you.

331
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,795
放心吧,我很好,没事的 看看我,挺好的吧
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine. Look at me. I'm fine.

332
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,924
你没事？噢,他没事,哦,太好了
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

333
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,731
你听到了吗？马蒂没出事 这就放心了
You hear that? Marty's fine. That's good to know.

334
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,431
因为我想知道...
Because I was wondering...

335
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,565
你怎么能这样对待我们？ 我以为大家都是朋友！
How could you do this to us? I thought we were your friends!

336
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,906
那又怎么样？ 我还回去的
What's the big deal? I was coming back.

337
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,105
再也不要这样做了 听到没有？
Don't ever do this again. Do you hear me?

338
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,910
-听见我说的没有？ -伙计们,我们快没时间了
- Do you hear him? - Guys, we're running out of time.

339
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,848
哦,麦尔曼,你弄坏了这儿的钟？
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

340
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,354
...再做一次！ 你还敢再这样做吗！
...do this again! Don't you ever, ever do this again!

341
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,882
快来这
Come here.

342
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,759
我们被告发了,孩子们
We've been ratted out, boys.

343
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,356
别开火！
Hold your fire!

344
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:24,402
做出一副可爱的样子,孩子们 可爱的样子
Cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.

345
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,713
如果现在有粪便的话,快把它扔出去
If you have any poo, fling it now.

346
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,951
是人类
It's the Man.

347
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,148
晚上好,警长们
Good evening, officers.

348
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,384
不,不,不,你现在不要讲话.好吗？
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

349
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,018
你不擅长“连词造句”
You're not good with the "putting words together

350
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:45,824
他们说出的好听话 你就悄悄的别做声
and their coming out good" thing. You keep it "shh."

351
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,389
嘿,你们好吗？ 你们知道吗？这里一切正常
Hey! How you doing? You know what? Everything's cool.

352
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:53,335
我们只是发生了点小事情 一点内部的小矛盾
We just had a little situation here. Little internal situation.

353
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,374
我的朋友有点头脑发热 每个人都可能发生的
My friend went a little crazy. Happens to everybody.

354
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,501
在这个城市里待的太久了 脑子里会有点胡思乱想
The city gets to us all. Went a little cuckoo in the head.

355
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,511
别说我胡思乱想
Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head.

356
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:05,447
别做声!我来解决
Just shush! I will handle this.

357
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,779
噢,我抓到他了！
Oh! I got him!

358
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,785
走,走,走！到这儿来
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

359
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,946
你们能不能让人喘口气？
Would you give a guy a break?

360
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,620
我们要把这个小朋友送回家 这一切就全当没发生. 好吗？
We'll take my little friend home and forget this ever happened. All right?

361
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,095
没有危险,没有敌人,行吗？
No harm, no foul, right?

362
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,568
嘿,没事了,是我, 雄师艾利克斯,动物园的
Hey, it's cool. It's me, Alex the lion. From the zoo.

363
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,907
他们怎么了？
What's the matter with them?

364
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,248
我的感觉真奇怪
I feel really, really weird.

365
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,791
我爱你们
I love you guys.

366
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:51,591
我非常爱你们
I love you so much.

367
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:15,084
昨晚在大中央车站发生的特大事件
Last night's dramatic incident in Grand Central

368
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:19,020
正是一例动物权益保护者 呼吁多年的真实写照： 标语：艾力克斯 你最棒
is an example of what animal rights wackos have been shouting for years:

369
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:22,115
动物们不应该被关在笼子里
Animals clearly don't belong in captivity.

370
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:25,185
他们应该被放归大自然
They are to be sent back to their natural habitat,

371
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:28,754
按照自己的方式自由的生活
where they will live their lives in the freedom they desire.

372
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,825
-嘿,要帮忙吗？ -他醒了！他醒了！
- Hey. Little help? - He's awake! He's awake!

373
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:33,726
防备一下！
Do something!

374
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:36,302
噢, 天那
Oh, man.

375
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:49,709
哎呀,我的脑袋
Oh, my head.

376
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:53,688
这是怎...？
What the...?

377
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:56,191
等等. 这是在哪里？这是什么呀？
Wait. Where? What?

378
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:00,691
我在一个盒子里！哦,不 不,不！不能待在盒子里
I'm in a box! Oh, no. No, no! Not the box.

379
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:04,359
哦,不,他们不能把我运走. 不行！
Oh, no, they can't transfer me. Not me!

380
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,427
哦,我喘不上气了.缺氧了
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

381
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:09,472
黑暗袭来了
Darkness creeping in.

382
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,804
呼吸困难,呼吸困难
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

383
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:14,003
四周都是围墙
Walls closing in around me.

384
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,372
好寂寞,好寂寞呀
So alone. So alone.

385
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:20,383
- 艾利克斯！,艾利克斯,你在那吗？ - 马蒂,是你吗？
- Alex! Alex, are you there? - Marty?

386
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:23,716
- 是我！说话,哥们 - 哦,马蒂！你在这儿！
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy. - Oh, Marty! You're here!

387
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:26,620
- 到底怎么回事？你没事吧？ - 看起来不太妙
- What's going on? You okay? - This doesn't look good.

388
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,749
- 艾利克斯,马蒂,是你们吗？ - 格洛丽亚！
- Alex, Marty, is that you? - Gloria!

389
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,954
- 你也在这儿！ - 我爱死你的声音了
- You're here too! - I am loving the sound of your voice.

390
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:34,293
- 发生什么事了？ - 我们都在装货箱里
- What is going on? - We're all in crates.

391
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:35,491
噢, 不！
Oh, no!

392
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,200
- 刚才又睡着了 - 麦尔曼！
- Sleeping just knocks me out. - Melman!

393
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,362
是麦尔曼吗？
Is that Melman?

394
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:43,167
- 你还好吧？ - 是,恩,我没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah. No, I'm fine.

395
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,073
我经常一做MRI就打盹
I often doze off while I'm getting an MRI.

396
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:48,976
- 你没在做MRI - 那是在做CAT扫描
- You're not getting an MRI. - CAT scan?

397
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:51,913
不是CAT扫描, 你是在运送车 是动物园的运送车
No CAT scan. It's a transfer. It's a zoo transfer.

398
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:55,440
动物园的运送车？ 噢,不 不,不.我不能被送走
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no. No, no, I can't be transferred.

399
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,113
我和Goldberg医生都约好了五点见面的
I have an appointment with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

400
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:00,850
还要开些处方的
There are prescriptions that have to be filled.

401
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:03,519
其它动物园都付不起我的医疗费的
No other zoo could afford my medical care.

402
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:05,186
而且我不会做HMO的
And I am not going HMO.

403
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:08,026
别紧张,麦尔曼 一切都会好的
Take it easy, Melman. It's going to be okay.

404
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:12,694
- 我们会没事的 - 不,我们不可能没事
- We are going to be okizay. - No, we're not going to be okizay.

405
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,897
好了,都是因为你,我们才遭得这罪！
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

406
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:18,499
因为我？我可没看出来是我的错
Because of me? I fail to see how this is my fault.

407
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:21,976
- 你开玩笑吧,马蒂？ - 是你,是你踢翻的人群
- You're kidding, right, Marty? - You. You ticked off the people.

408
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,571
你咬的手,马蒂 你咬的手
You bit the hand, Marty. You bit the hand.

409
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:29,176
“我不知道我是谁. 我得到大自然中寻找自己”哦,请
"I don't know who I am. I got to go find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

410
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:32,484
我可没让你跟我一起来,对吧？
I did not ask you to come after me, did I?

411
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:34,217
他说的在理
He does have a point.

412
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,385
我说过我们应该待在动物园里 但是你们...
I did say we should stay at the zoo, but you guys...

413
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:38,587
麦尔曼,别说了
Melman, just shut it.

414
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:41,324
是你最先提议这样做的
You suggested this idea to him in the first place.

415
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,866
- 别把麦尔曼扯进来 - 谢谢,格洛丽亚
- Leave Melman out of this. - Thank you, Gloria.

416
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:46,798
再说了,我们被转运又不是我的错
Besides, it's not my fault that we were transferred.

417
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,634
麦尔曼,别说了 有人觉得恶心吗？
Melman, shut it. Does anybody feel nauseous?

418

00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:21,026
如果人们爱戴你, 那是因为他们不知道你的真相！
If the people loved you, it's only because they didn't know the real you!

你可没帮上一点忙
You're not helping the situation.

438
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,441
老实待在那
Status.

439
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:39,744

513
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,277
哦,看那
Oh, look at us.

514
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:47,721
我们大家又在一起了 完好无损
We're all here together. Safe and sound.

515
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,782
是呀,我们都在这里
Yeah, here we are.

516
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,728
“这里”到底是什么哪里？
Where exactly is "here"?

517
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,067
圣地亚哥
San Diego.

518
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,703

我跟你们讲这可能是圣地亚哥动物园

522
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:20,916

圣地亚哥？要是不如比圣地亚哥怎么办？
San Diego? What could be worse than San Diego?

525
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,258
不知道 这地方缺少刺激！
I don't know. This place is crackalacking!

526
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:33,496
哦,我要去看看,去看看

- 我要杀了你！ - 别激动!

- 20-second timeout. - I'll never talk to you again.

531

现在,看. 我们要去找到人类
Now, look. We're just going to find the people,

532
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:50,211
刚来到这里 然后弄清楚这是怎么回事
get checked in and have this mess straightened out.

533
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:53,979
哦,好 这里棒极了. 圣地亚哥
Oh, great. This is just great. San Diego.

534
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:58,016
现在我要和Shamu还有 他那诡秘的笑比一比了
Now I'll have to compete with Shamu and his smug little grin.

535
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:00,119
我嬴不了得. 胜不了他
I can't top that. Can't top it.

536
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:03,758
我输了！我完蛋了 我彻底没戏了
I'm ruined! I'm done. I'm out of the business.

537
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:07,065
都是你的错,马蒂！ 都是你害的我
It's your fault, Marty! You've ruined me.

538
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,799
好啦,艾利克斯 你真觉得
Come on, Alex. Do you honestly think

539
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:12,205
我希望这一切发生？
I intended all of this to happen?

540
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:15,210
你想让我说对不起？ 是吗？
You want me to say that I'm sorry? Is that what you want?

541
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,267
好吧,对...
Okay, I'm...

542
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:18,947
他让我别出声
He just shushed me.

543
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:22,143
马蒂,看,你得再有点...
Marty, look, you've got to be just a little bit more und...

544
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,621
-别嘘我 -你们听见了吗？没听见？
- Don't you shush me. - Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

545
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:32,428
-我听见了 -那儿有音乐,还有人
- I hear it now. - Where there's music, there's people.

546
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:35,090
-直接去总部 -走小路比较好
- Go to the head honcho. - A sidewalk would be nice.

547
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,723
对呀,这地方可真脏
Yeah, what a dump.

548
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,064
这应该叫做圣地烂哥动物园
They should call it the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

549
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:44,334
首先他们会跟你说,“我们有个伟大而且开放的政策. 动物们可以随意到处奔跑.”
First they tell you, "We got this great open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

550
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:48,002
然后,头上会插满鲜花 大家互相拥抱
Next thing, flowers in your hair, everybody's hugging everybody.

551
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:51,445
你会渐渐喜欢上这里的 这边来,伙计们！快点！

好吧,让我们留给人们个好印象

微笑,每个人 大家一起来

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,963
因为我们在后面的沙滩上坐了好几个小时
Because we've been sitting on that beach back there for hours,

593
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,468
没有人过来问我们
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

594
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:29,903
我不知道这里通常是怎么管理的
I don't know how things are normally run around here,

595
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:33,101
只是那里刚才出了点事,不过已经摆平了

他把马岛B吓跑了
He scared the fossa away.

朱莉国王,他们是什么人？ 他们到底是什么人？！

他们是外星人.来自蛮荒未来的野蛮外星人

他们是来消灭我们的,强走我们的女人 和宝贵的金属
They've come to kill us. And take our women. And our precious metals.

608
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:22,821
站起来,马蒂 请不要接近国王脚,好吗？
Get up, Mort. Do not be near the king's feet, okay?

我们在躲藏.大家别出声 包括我在内
We're hiding. Be quiet, everyone. Including me.

610
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,226
哪儿来的响声？
Who's making that noise?

611
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,493
哦,又是我
Oh, it's me again.

612
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,797
在那呢！抓住他！快, 格洛丽亚
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

613
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:36,168
-够了！别再用棍子打了 -我想她捉到了
- Enough! Enough with the stick. - I think she got it.

614

还在我身上吗？我讨厌蜘蛛
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

615

好了,掉了
It's okay. It's gone.

616
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:43,537
他们是群野蛮人
They are savages.

617
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:44,841
今晚我们死定了
Tonight we die.

618
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:48,008
我的脚. 我告诉过你... 我告诉过你要... 我告诉每个...
The feet. I told you... I told you to... I told every...

619
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:49,984
我跟他说过脚的事情吗？
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

620
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,214
他确实和你说过脚的事情
He did tell you about the feet.

621
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:57,717
-等等. 我有个计划 -真的？
- Wait. I have a plan. - Really?

622
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:00,160
我设计了一个狡猾的测试
I have devised a cunning test

623
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,961
能判断他们是否是野蛮的杀手
to see whether these are savage killers.

624
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,536
嗨,你好
Hi there.

625
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:16,102

You let me handle it. Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

626
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:21,940

Hi there.

627
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:28,087
哦,天那,对不起
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

628

哦,艾利克斯,你干了些什么？ -停！停！好的,好的
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do? - Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

629
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:36,058
我是头愚蠢... 一头愚蠢的狮子 哦,天那！
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion. Oh, jeez!

630
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:42,263
-啊,艾利克斯 -哦,可怜的小宝贝
- Aw, Alex! - Oh, you poor little baby.

631
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:44,966
那头又大又无情的狮子没吓着你吧？
Did that big mean lion scare you?

632
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:49,478
他吓着你了？这头又大又坏的老混蛋
He did? He's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

633
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:52,709
过来.妈妈来抱你了 哦,看看你
Come on. Mama'll hold you. Awww, look at you.

从远处看他们还挺可爱的
They are so cute from a reasonable distance.

635
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:59,588
多么可爱的小家伙 我真想把他放在咖啡里沾一沾
Aren't you the sweetest little thing. I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

636
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:02,557
他们不过是一群娘娘腔
They're just a bunch of pansies.

637
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,956
我不知道
I don't know.

638
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:06,928
那个长了一头狂发的家伙
There's something about that one with the crazy hairdo

639
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,123
有些可疑
that I find suspicious.

640
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,757
别瞎说,
Nonsense, Maurice.

641
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,895
大家过来 咱们去会会那些娘娘腔们！
Come on, everybody. Let's go and meet the pansies!

他很有风格
He's got style.

645
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,496
那是什么呀,像只珍珠鸡？
What is he, like, king of the guinea pigs?

646
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,976
我觉得是只松鼠
I think it's a squirrel.

647
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:58,207
欢迎,高大的娘娘腔们
Welcome, giant pansies.

648
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:01,045
在我的领地内请自便
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

649
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:03,551
-绝对是松鼠 -没错,是松鼠
- Definitely a squirrel. - Yep. Squirrel.

650
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,954
你们驱走了马岛B,我们为此不胜感激
We thank you with enormous gratitude for chasing away the fossa.

651
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:10,083
-“马岛魔" -是马岛B
- The "whossa"? - The fossa.

652
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:14,162
他们总是非法侵入并扰乱我们的狂欢
They annoy us by trespassing, interrupting our parties

653
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,164
- 然后把我们的四肢都拽下来 - 不错
- and ripping our limbs off. - Good.

654
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:19,224
我们只是在努力寻找人类,所以...
We're just trying to find out where the people are, so...

655
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:21,429
伙计,你的牙可真大！
What big teeth you have. Man!

656
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:25,770
不象话. 你没发现你是在侮辱这怪物吗？
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not see that you have insulted the freak?

657
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,901
你必须告诉我 你们到底是什么人？
You must tell me, who the heck are you?

658
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:33,074
我是艾利克斯. 安乐学说 这是
I'm Alex. The Alex. And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

659
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,414
那你们这些大个子从哪里来呢？
And just where are you giants from?

660
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:38,579
我们从纽约来还有...
We're from New York and...

661
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,350
向纽约来的巨人们问好！
All hail the New York giants!

662
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:43,688
纽约巨人们好！
New York giants!

663
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:48,226
这难道是近亲交配活动？
Is this some sort of inbreeding program?

664
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,392
我说我们应该问问这群傻瓜人类在哪里
I say we just got to ask these bozos where the people are.

665
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:54,800
打扰一下,我们这群傻瓜 当然知道人类的情况了
Excuse me. We bozos have the people, of course.

666
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:57,931
嘿,他们知道人类的情况
Hey, the bozos have the people.

667
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:01,534
哦,好,太棒了,不错.
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

668
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:03,044
他们在上面
They're up there.

669
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:10,913
你们喜欢人类吗？ 他们可不是一帮让人喜欢的家伙
Don't you love the people? Not a very lively bunch, though.

670
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,079
哇
Wow.

671
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:14,919
你们那还有没有活着的人？
So do you have any live people?

672
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,790
没有了. 只剩下尸体了
No. Only dead ones.

673
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,829
我的意思是说,如果在这里有许多活人话
I mean, if we had a lot of live people here,

674
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:24,458
就不能叫做野外了,不是吗？
it wouldn't be called the wild, would it?

675
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:25,831
野外？
The wild?

676
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:28,996
喔,等一下,毛绒桶
Whoa. Hold up there a second, fuzzbucket.

677
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:30,403
你意思是,就像
You mean, like,

678
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:35,067
那种“住在泥坑里,用树页擦屁股”的野外？
the "live in a mud hut, wipe yourself with a leaf" type wild?

679
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,738
-擦屁股干嘛？ -天哪
- Who wipes? - Oy vey.

680
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:39,543
- 天哪! - 大家一起来，天哪!
- Oy vey! - Oy vey, everybody!

681
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:41,549
天哪!
Oy vey!

682
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:43,983
我可以暂时离开一下吗？
Could you excuse me for a moment?

683
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:51,656
让我离开这里！ 我们得离开这里！
Get me out of here! We got to get out of here!

684
00:43:51,894 --> 00:43:54,590
-救命呀！ -你在干什么？！
- Help! - What are you doing?!

685
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:56,791
我要游回纽约去
I'm swimming back to New York.

686
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:59,858
我知道希望不大 但至少也要试一下！
I know my chances are slim, but I have to try!

687
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:03,497
-你不会游泳！ -我说过成功机会不大的！
- You can't swim! - I said my chances are slim!

688
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:08,408
大自然! 到处都是!！ 把它拿掉! 我看不见了! 看不见了!
Nature! It's all over me! Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

689
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:12,013
我看见了！
I can see!

690
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:16,315
看,很明显出了点小误会
Look. There's obviously just been a little mistake.

691
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:18,946
人类不是故意把我们丢弃在这里的
The people didn't dump us here on purpose.

692
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:23,220
一旦他们搞清出发生了什么事 就会来救我们的,对吗？
As soon as they realize what happened, they'll come looking for us, right?

693
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:24,418
对,是的
Yeah, right.

694
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:28,521
我不知该怎么说 但是我们天性喜欢自由
I don't know the words But we're born free

695
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:32,159
你知道吗？ 我敢打赌他们已经出发来找我们了
You know something? I bet they're already on their way.

696
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:43,036
哦,孩子们,早餐要吃冰冻寿司了
Well, boys, it's going to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

697
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:47,515
瑞可.
Rico.

698
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:54,314
好吧,既然我注定要死在这个孤岛上
Well, since I'm doomed to die on this forsaken island,

699
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,688
我,麦尔曼 曼凯维奇,
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

700
00:44:56,759 --> 00:45:00,126
现头脑清醒,身体欠佳
being of sound mind and unsound body,

701
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:04,394
将我的遗物平均分给你们三个
have divided my estate equally among the three of you.

702
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:06,895
对不起,艾利克斯
Sorry, Alex.

703
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:11,633
嘿！一个厕所.不错呀,马尔曼 还是室外冲水型的
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman. Outdoor plumbing.

704
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,607
不,这可不是厕所
No, it's not a latrine.

705
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:17,942
是个坟墓,你把卖而浪漫送进了坟墓 这下高兴了？
It's a grave. You sent Melman to his grave. Are you happy?

706
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,345
哈,算了吧
Aw, come on.

707
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:22,851
这可不是人生的终点 而是一个全新的开始
This isn't the end. This is a whole new beginning.

708
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:25,183
这有可能是有史以来最刺激的事了
This could be the best that's happened.

709
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:27,279
不,不,不,不
No. No. No. No.

710
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:31,850
不,不,不,不, 这可不是我们遇到的最好的事情
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not the best thing that's happened to us.

711
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:35,830
你滥用生日许愿的魔力把霉运都带给了我们
You abused the power of the birthday wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

712
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:38,492
为什么要说出你的愿望? 你就不该说的
Why'd you tell your wish? You're not supposed to.

713
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:41,196
我本来就不想告诉你们的. 记得吗?
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

714
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,762
- 是你们逼我说的噢 - 哦,好吧
- You guys made me tell you. - Oh, okay.

715
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:48,504
再说啦, 这根本不是霉运 而是好运
Besides, this isn't bad luck. This is good luck.

716
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:51,411
看看周围,没有围墙 没有作息时间表
Look around. There's no fences, no schedules.

717
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,949
这是个美丽的地方... 宝贝,我们生在...
This place is beautiful. Baby, we were born...

718
00:45:54,016 --> 00:45:56,541
好了, 好了, 我听够了
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

719
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:01,556
这边是你的岛 这边是我们的岛
This is your side of the island, and this is our side of the island.

720
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,320
那边是倒霉区你可以蹦可以跳
That is the bad side, where you can prance and skip

721
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:07,885
就像个着了魔的马精 你想干什么就干什么吧
like a magical pixie horse and do whatever the heck you want.

722
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:11,923
这边是好运区, 这的人们都爱纽约都想回家
This is the good side for those who love New York and care about going home.

723
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,765
- 别这样呀 - 不行,不行,往后退!后退!
- Come on. - No, no. Back! Back!

724
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:16,600
你知道吗? 这样可不好的
You know what? This isn't good.

725
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:21,006
好吧! 你们在那边 我在这边
Okay! You all have your side, and I'll have mine.

726
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:23,944
如果你们需要帮忙,我会过来的
And if you need me, I'll be over here,

727
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:27,949
我要在快乐区这边 享受好的日子了
on the fun side of the island, having a good old time.

728
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:29,541
这边是快乐区
This is the fun side,

729
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,918
我们要幸福的活下来直到他们接我们回去
where we'll have a great time surviving until we go home.

730
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:35,719
- 一段美好的时光! - 这边最快乐了
- A yabbadabbado old time! - This side's the best.

731
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:39,318
那边真臭! 就像泽西种牛粪坑区一样!
That side stinks! You're on the Jersey side of this cesspool!

732
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:41,625
- 威尔玛! - 现在我们干什么?
- Wilma! - Now what do we do?

733
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:44,131
别担心 我有个能让我们获救的办法
Don't worry. I have a plan to get us rescued.

734
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:50,362
真想看看 马蒂看到这一切时是什么表情
Can't wait to see the look on Marty's face when he sees this.

735
00:46:53,776 --> 00:46:57,268
看看他 没有我们的帮助他是多么的无助呀
Just look at him. He's helpless without us.

736
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:08,417
别说话, 你这个草包!
Shut up, Spalding.

737
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:16,589
哥们, 我在这儿都站了好几个小时了
I've been standing here for hours, man.

738
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,328
我还要在这摆多久的造型呀?
How long do I have to pose like this?

739
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:22,536
快大工告成了
She is finito.

740
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:27,240
我觉得一百万英里内没有任何一只救生艇
I defy any rescue boat within a million miles

741
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,369
不想救我们
to miss this baby.

742
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:33,643
时机一到 我们就点燃这自由火炬
When the moment is right, we will ignite the beacon of liberty

743
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:37,447
从这可怕的梦魇中获得解脱!
and be rescued from this awful nightmare!

744
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,512
你觉得如何? 很酷吧?
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

745
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,616
- 麦尔曼,自由之火钻的怎么样了? - 好极了.你这个傻瓜
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman? - Great. Idiot.

746
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:45,183
我听见了
I heard that.

747
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:47,855
为什么不能借点马蒂的火种?
Why can't we just borrow some of Marty's fire?

748
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:53,158
那市野火, 我们可不能用野火点燃自由女神小姐
That's wild fire. We're not using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

749
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:56,103
-麦尔曼,磨呀,快 -我一直在磨...
- Now, rub, Melman. - I've been doing...

750
00:47:56,172 --> 00:48:00,768
不行了, 磨不出来 我磨不出火花,就...就是磨不出来
I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

751
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:03,236
火
Fire.

752
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:05,436
火
Fire.

753
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:09,177
火! 火!
Fire! Fire!

754
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:14,315
哦,我的天那!
Oh, my

755
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:15,982
火!
Fire!

756
00:48:16,058 --> 00:48:17,923
先不要! 不,不,不要!
Not yet! No, no! No!

757
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:19,484
火!
Fire!

758
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:20,995
麦尔曼,先拿着!
Melman, hold still!

759
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:23,728
快跳! 艾利克斯,跳!
Jump! Alex, jump!

760
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:26,063
别担心 猫科动物总会落在他们的...
Don't worry, cats always land on their...

761
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:29,936
脸上? 天那,你是哪类猫科动物?
Face? Man, what kind of cat are you?

762
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:40,514
你这个疯子!
You maniac!

763
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,077
你把它全给烧毁了!
You burned it up!

764
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:45,417
你这个混蛋!
Darn you!

765
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:48,355
你这个大混蛋!
Darn you all to heck!

766
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:50,919
我们现在可以到快乐区了吗?
Can we go to the fun side now?

767
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:55,322
大家都冷静一下 赶快, 都坐下来
Everybody, calm down. Come on. Into your chairs.

768
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:58,196
大家都冷静一下 放开他的尾巴
Everybody, calm down. Let go of his tail.

769
00:48:58,267 --> 00:49:00,735
请你把他俩分开好吗?
Separate those two, would you, please?

770
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:02,566
你到这来, 你到那去. 大伙们...
You here, you there. Everyone...

771
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,140
都安静一下, 好吗?
Calm down, people, okay?

772
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:10,474
现在,有请尊贵的皇室后代 赫赫有名的.......
Now, presenting your royal highness, the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

773
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:13,709
你们知道的, 等等, 等等 鼓掌, 好开始
You know, et cetera, et cetera. Hooray. Let's go.

774
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:15,375
现在,
Now, everybody,

775
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:20,150
我们每个人都很好奇我们的客人 那些纽约来的巨人
we all have great curiosity about our guests, the New York giants.

776
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:22,122
- 好的,willie? - 我喜欢他们
- Yes, Willie? - I like them.

777
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:26,150
我喜欢他们,在我第一次 见他们之前我就喜欢他们
I like them. I liked them first. Before I even met them I liked them.

778
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:29,994
我一下子就喜欢上他们了. 你们讨厌他们是因为我是多么的爱他们
I liked them right away. You hate them compared to how much I like them.

779
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:32,330
哦, 别说了. 你真烦人!
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

780
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:36,700
好了, 从我们记事以来
Now, for as long as we can remember,

781
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:41,573
就一直受到可怕的马岛B的侵袭和猎杀
we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

782
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:44,340
马岛B! 马岛B来了!
The fossa! The fossa are attacking!

783
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:50,308
是一本烹饪书! 只是一本烹饪书!
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

784
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:52,013
请, 莫里斯
Please. Maurice.

785
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:54,852
安静!
Quiet!

786
00:49:54,924 --> 00:49:59,088
别一惊一咋的, 伙计们. 他们不可能这么快就来得
Come on, y'all. They're not attacking us this very instant.

787
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:03,996
我的绝妙计划就是:
So my genius plan is this:

788
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:06,466
我们要把那些纽约巨人
We will make the New York giants

789
00:50:06,535 --> 00:50:09,436
当成朋友,和他们走的近些
our friends and keep them close.

790
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:12,804
这样,ailikesi 先生就可以保护我们
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

791
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:16,242
我们就安全了也不用担心
we will be safe and never have to worry

792
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:20,112
那些可恶的马岛B了, 永远也不会了
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

793
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:26,444
我以前就是这么想的 我以前就是这么想的.没错,是我,我想过
I thought of that. I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

794
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:29,252
等一等,大伙们,等等 让我再想想
Hold on, everybody. Hold on. I'm just thinking now.

795
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:32,158
我的意思是, 有人想知道为什么马岛B
I mean, does anyone wonder why the fossa

796
00:50:32,228 --> 00:50:34,822
害怕艾利克斯先生吗?
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

797
00:50:34,897 --> 00:50:38,162
我是说,也许我们也很怕他
I mean, maybe we should be scared too.

798
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:41,294
要是艾利克斯先生比马岛B更厉害怎么办?
What if Mr. Alex is even worse than the fossa?

799
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:46,003
跟你说吧,我一看见那个家伙就全身发抖
I tell you, that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

800
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:48,566
莫里斯, 你没有举手发言
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

801
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:52,375
所以, 对你的评价将会用 历史上最邪恶的字眼
Therefore, your heinous comment will be stricken from the record.

802
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,847
还有别的什么人也对此感到害怕吗?
Does anyone else have the heebie-jeebies?

803
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:59,387
没有? 好的, 那你就住嘴吧
No? Good. So shut up.

804
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:02,687
等纽约巨人们醒来后
When the New York giants wake up,

805
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:08,424
我们一定要让他们感觉像在天堂里一样
we will make sure that they wake up in paradise.

806
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:12,097
好了,现在,谁想来点饼干?
Now, who would like a cookie?

807
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:41,594
嗨, 艾利克斯. 麦尔曼和格洛丽亚 在那边开心呢
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria are over there having a good time.

808
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,224
那边还可以容下一个人
There's room on the fun side for one more.

809
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,927
不, 谢了
No, thanks.

810
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:50,165
看, 我一直在想 也许,如果你给这个地方一个机会话
Look, I've been thinking. Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

811
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,231
我不确定 但也许它会另你开心的
I don't know, you might even enjoy yourself.

812
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:56,767
马蒂, 我累了.我饿了
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

813
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,746
我只想回家去
I just want to go home.

814
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:03,908
你能不能给它个机会? 考虑一下
Could you just give it a chance? Think about it.

815
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,721
那里要是缺了你就不算是快乐区了
It really isn't the fun side without you.

816
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,166
我知道. 然后...
I know. And then...

817
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,236
-是他 -谁呀?
- It's him. - Who is it?

818
00:52:30,746 --> 00:52:34,045
送比萨饼的 你以为会是谁?
It's the pizza man. Who the heck do you think it is?

819
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:36,749
是的? 我能帮你什么吗?
Yes? Can I help you?

820
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:38,977
我能来快乐区吗?
Can I come to the fun side?

821
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:42,715
您再说一遍?
Beg your pardon?

822
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,722
你知道, 我是个混蛋
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

823
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:52,396
但我一直在想你说的话, 我很抱歉
But I've been thinking about what you said, and I'm sorry.

824
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:03,338
欢迎来到Casa del野生世界 放松一下
Welcome to Casa del Wild. Take a load off.

825

嘿,来杯酒吧. 从房上取得

这是海水
This is seawater.

830
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,039
哦,别咽了. 这只是暂时的 等管道修好了就行了
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just temporary till the plumbing's done.

831
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:36,043
嘿, 你看起来很饿
Hey, y'all look hungry.

832
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:39,805
吃点大自然的馈赠如何?
How would you like some of nature's goodness?

833

你有吃的?
You have food?

海带串
Seaweed on a stick.

00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:49,880
海带?
Seaweed?

837
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:53,386
穿在棍上 尝一下你才知道它的鲜美
On a stick. Don't love it till you try it.

838
00:54:01,236 --> 00:54:02,794
简直不可相信
That's unbelievable.

839
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:06,332
-味道真不错 -好,谢谢

00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:09,275
正和口味,对吗?
It does kind of hit the spot, doesn't it?

841
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:13,510
也许加点柠檬会更好的
Well, maybe it could use a little lemon.

842
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:21,786
不,这就很好. 真的不错 还有比这更好的吗
No, it's great. It's really great. Doesn't get any better than this.

843
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:23,620
哦, 真的很好
Oh, but it does.

844
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:25,817
尝尝这个
Check this out.

845
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:35,092
哇噻, 你们看那
Wow. Would you look at that.

846
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:39,664
就像是成千上万亿的直升飞机
It's like billions and billions of helicopters.

847
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:42,142
瞧,一颗流星 赶快许个愿!
It's a shooting star. Make a wish. Quick!

848
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:45,374
噢, 一块肥厚多汁的牛排如何?
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

849
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:46,971
你知道吗,艾利克斯?
You know what, Alex?

850
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:51,713
我向你保证如果我明天还活着 我就一定帮你找一块牛排
I promise you I'm going to find you a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

851
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:53,084
谢谢, 马蒂
Thanks, Marty.

852
00:54:53,155 --> 00:54:56,215
天不早了 我想我得去...
It is getting late. I guess I'm going to...

853
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,725
我也该去睡觉了
I think I'm going to hit the sack too.

854
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:00,659
祝大伙做个好梦
Sweet dreams, everyone.

855
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:32,358
艾利克斯.
Alex.

856
00:55:42,337 --> 00:55:44,066
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

857
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:49,401
27,28,29 30条黑的,只有29条白的
Twenty-seven, 28, 29. Thirty black and only 29 white.

858
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:52,311
看来你是黑底带着白条纹的了
Looks like you're black with white stripes after all.

859
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:53,905
难题解决了. 晚安
Dilemma solved. Good night.

860
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,153
你看到了吧, 艾利克斯 先生在梳理同伴的毛发
You see, Maurice, Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

861
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,666
很显然他是一个温柔而且有很善心的动物
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

862
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,669
你怎么可以害怕这样好的人哪?
How can you have the heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

863
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:18,400
看他 多么可爱呀毛茸茸的
Look at him. He's so cute and plushy.

864
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:20,999
我觉得他不是在梳理那人的毛发
I don't think he was grooming him.

865
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:23,544
在我看来他是在品尝那人的味道
Look more like he was tasting him to me.

866
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:26,945
随你怎么说吧,无所谓 我不在乎
Suit yourself, no matter. I don't care.

867
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:31,179
很快我的计划就要付诸实施了
Soon we will put my excellent plan to action.

868
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,983
我们所要做的就是等待
All we have to do is wait

869
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:37,719
等他们熟睡之后
until they are deep in their sleep.

870
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:46,333
到底要等多久呀!
How long is this going to take?!

871
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:14,194
哎呀,这可真糟糕!
Well, this sucks!

872
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:18,128
快醒醒,艾利克斯先生
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

873
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:21,793
快醒醒,艾利克斯先生
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

874
00:57:22,404 --> 00:57:24,201
太阳都照到屁股了
Rise and shining.

875
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:27,470
醒醒,先生!
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

876
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:29,010
醒醒,先生!
Wake up! Alex!

877
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:30,773
你在嘬手指?
You suck your thumb?

878
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:36,410
我们这是在哪里? 到底发生了什么事?
Where are we? What the heck is going on?

879
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:38,749
海滩去哪了? 别急
Where's the beach? Take it easy.

880
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:41,813
-谁造的这个森林? -别这么惊慌,大怪物
- Who built a forest? - Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

881
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,084
在你们睡觉的时候,
While you were asleep,

882
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:47,322
我们轻松的把你们带到了这个小小的天堂
we simply took you to our little corner of heaven.

883
00:57:47,396 --> 00:57:49,660
欢迎来到马达加斯加
Welcome to Madagascar.

884
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:52,291
-马达加谁呀? -什么?
- Mada-who-ah? - What?

885
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:54,733
不,不是谁呀, 是斯加
No, not whooha. Ascar.

886
00:58:02,377 --> 00:58:04,072
马蒂,这里...
Marty. It's...

887
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:06,706
就想动物园里墙上的壁画一样
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

888
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:10,946
哦, 不, 朋友们, 那可全是真的
Oh, no, fella, that is the real deal right there.

889
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:13,078
瞧那儿, 景色真不错
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

890
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:17,057
那可是你一直梦寐以求的呀, 现在它就在那里
That's the thing that you were always looking at, but it's actually there.

891
00:58:17,192 --> 00:58:20,593
-那可是真正的... -游览一下整个公园如何?
- That's the real version of... - How about once around the park?

892
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:24,095
让我们兴奋起来 深呼吸这里的新鲜空气
Let's get our blood pumping, lungs breathing this fresh air.

893
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:25,565
谁跟我去?!
Who's with me?!

894
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:28,102
呃,我可不行... 你输了!
Naw. I don't think I could... You're it!

895
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,762
嘿, 想去周围玩玩吗?
Hey! Want to play around?

896
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:33,201
追上你了!
Got you there!

897
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:34,640
来这边!
Come here!

898
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,204
你输了
You're it.

899
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:39,008
嘿, 不比了! 嘿, 你疯了!
Hey, stop that! Hey, you're crazy!

900
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:42,175
好的, 马蒂, 我不行了
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

901
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,742
我不行了, 受不了了. 你赢了
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

902
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,311
快点, 艾利克斯, 打起精神来
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

903
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:49,289
我已经两天没吃饭了
I haven't eaten in two days.

904
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:52,486
我的血糖太低了 快没劲了
My blood sugar's real low. I just don't have the energy.

905
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:54,426
我可不觉得那是什么问题
I don't think that's your problem.

906
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:57,192
首先, 这可不是在草原上奔跑的状态
First of all, that's not how you run in the wild.

907
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:59,234
我们走. 开足马力准备上路了!
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

908
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:01,292
你就是要把狮子的本色发挥出来
You just have to let out that inner lion.

909
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,806
- 现在, 那头狮子是谁? - 马蒂, 我真的...
- Now, who's the cat? - Marty, I really don't...

910
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:08,036
你行的, 那是谁 快点! 我们走!
You are, that's who. Come on! Here we go!

911
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,908
就是那样. 咱们再跑的快点! 你狮子
That's it. Let's build up some steam! You the cat.

912
00:59:10,979 --> 00:59:12,571
- 那只狮子是谁? -就是你
- Who's the cat? - You the cat.

913
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:14,240
那只狮子是谁? -就是你
- Who's the cat? - You the cat.

914
00:59:14,316 --> 00:59:17,911
那只狮子是谁? 就是你 那只狮子是谁? 就是你
Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:59:17,986 --> 00:59:22,116
那只狮子是谁? 就是你 那只狮子是谁? 就是你
Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

916
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,255
我是狮子!
I'm the cat!

917
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:32,533
天那!
Surprise!

918
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:41,566
你赢了. 你赢了!
You're it. You're it!

919
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,941
追不上狮子, 跑的太快了
Can'tjuke the cat. Cat's too quick.

920
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:52,251
我感觉好象有一英里长的熏牛肉 在眼前飞舞一直飞上天!
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye on the fly from the deli in the sky!

921
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:56,281
-让我们去撒野吧! -我正想说呢!
- Let's go wild! - Now you're talking!

922
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:06,128
哥们! 我感觉不一样了
Man! I feel different.

923
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:09,500
跳啊,跳啊,跳啊 跳啊,跳啊,跳啊!
Noogie, noogie, noogie. Noogie, noogie, noogie!

924
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:13,134
就像充足了电似的
Kind of charged up or something.

925
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,006
-就像你说的,宝贝,这里... -缺少刺激
- Like you said, baby, it's... - Crackalacking.

926
01:00:16,078 --> 01:00:20,515
- 这样对吗? -哦,对,哦,是的
- Ain't that right, Melman? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

927
01:00:23,218 --> 01:00:24,776
我在天堂
I'm in heaven.

928
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:29,790
你看,艾利克斯现在成了我们的朋友 而且马岛B不见了
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend and the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

929
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:32,759
可以说我的计划奏效了
It could be said that my plan is working

930
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:36,127
以一种非常好的方式
in a very good working kind of way.

931
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:39,326
艾利克斯,你应该尝尝这个
Alex. You got to try some of this.

932
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,437
我感觉很好 感觉又像个国王了
I feel good. Feel like a king again.

933
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:45,432
国王?
King?

934
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:48,038
你应该看看他的架势
You should see his act.

935
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,307
快点,艾利克斯,为什么 不给他露两手你威风的样子呢?
Come on, Alex, why don't you show him some of your act.

936
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,281
哦,不, 我真觉得我... 好吧
Oh. No, I really don't think I could... Okay.

937
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:57,614
女士们先生们 所有的动物们
Ladies and gentlemen. Primates of all ages.

938
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:59,813
野生世界自豪地向你们介绍:
The wild proudly presents:

939
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:01,355
国王
The king.

940
01:01:01,423 --> 01:01:04,221
雄师艾利克斯!
Alex the lion!

941
01:01:05,227 --> 01:01:06,489
大家欢迎
E flat, fellas.

942
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:18,667
耶! 国王掌管一切!
Yeah! The king is in the house!

943
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,608
看, 如果他是国王,那他的王冠在哪里? 我这里有一个
See, if he is the king, then where is his crown? I've got a crown.

944
01:01:22,677 --> 01:01:25,805
有一个非常漂亮的 就在我头上
Got a very nice one. And it's here on my head.

945
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:27,849
你看一下, 我戴了没?
Look at it. Have I got it on?

946
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:36,147
吼一嗓子,伙计,吼一嗓子
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

947
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:44,629
哇. 我从来没听过这样的吼叫声
Wow. I've never heard that one before.

948
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:46,929
好耶! 再疯狂点,哥们!加油!
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

949
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,698
掀起点人浪!
Break out the wave!

950
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:18,759
打扰一下
Excuse me.

951
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:21,064
你咬着我屁股了
You're biting my butt.

952
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:25,839
-不,我没有呀 -你咬了
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

953
01:02:27,742 --> 01:02:29,835
-你干什么呀? -你咬我了!
- What did you do? - You just bit me!

954
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:32,072
不, 我没有,有吗?
No. I didn't. Did I?

955
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:33,705
你是咬了
You kind of did.

956
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:35,909
你到底怎么回事?
What the heck is wrong with you?

957
01:02:37,652 --> 01:02:38,914
你为什么咬我?
Why'd you bite me?

958
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:41,785
- 伙计, 因为你是他的大餐 -什么?!
- Man, it's because you are his dinner. - What?!

959
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:44,121
-对不起? -真不会说话
- Excuse me? - That's dumb.

960
01:02:44,192 --> 01:02:48,652
过来,来, 朋友之间简单地咬臀部是什么感觉?
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple bite on the buttocks among friends?

961
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,595
来,给我来一小口
Here, give me a nibble.

962
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:54,362
派对结束了,朱莉 你绝妙的计划失败了
The party is over, Julien. Your brilliant plan has failed.

963
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,199
你们在说什么?
What are you talking about?

964
01:02:56,271 --> 01:02:57,966
这里,你的朋友就是我们所说的
Your friend here is what we call

965
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,202
高级型扑猎者和吃人机器
a deluxe-model hunting and eating machine.

966
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:03,210
而且他吃牛排...
And he eats steak...

967
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:04,745
...那是你
...which is you.

968
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:09,011
-你给我滚出去 -好好好,  我承认
- Get out of here. - Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

969
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:10,915
计划失败了
The plan failed.

970
01:03:10,986 --> 01:03:14,251
所有东西都没了! 我们糟厄运了
All is lost! We're all doomed.

971
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:19,123
马岛B又会回来的 还会用嘴一口一口的把我们吃掉,因为...
The fossas will come back and gobble us with their mouths because...

972
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:21,560
...我们都是牛排
...we are all steak.

973
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,495
我是牛排! 我,我,我是!
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

974
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:25,795
艾利克斯先生不能待在这里
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

975
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:30,201
在岛上他属于 马岛B 那种类型的动物
He belongs with his own kind on the fossa side of the island.

976
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:32,172
以我至高无上的权力
By the power vested in me,

977
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,539
依照丛林的法律 等等等等.......
by the law of the jungle, blah, blah, blah, blah...

978
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,770
快跑!
Be gone!

979
01:03:36,845 --> 01:03:39,678
什么? 怎么了,在你看来我像牛排吗?
