Some people say that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

Growing greener than it was before
幼芽新张

14
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:01,130
Bees are droning by Spider silk is softly spinning
蜜蜂飞鸣 蜘蛛织网

I can't believe we get to stay for the whole season.
真不敢相信 我们要在这儿过整个夏天

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,930
Well, what are we waiting for? Race you down!
好呀 那还等什么? 下降了!

22
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,330
The breeze is blowing light and sweet The grass, a carpet at your feet
空气清新 绿草如茵

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,700
Catch the colors Feel the heat of the sun

All the sparrows in the dell Swirling round like a carousel

Tink, fairy camp isn't out here in the open.
叮当 这个外面的野地不是仙子园

45
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,410
We need to stay hidden from the humans.
我们要躲着人类

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,510
- We do? - Uh. Yeah.

That's why fairy camp is in here.

63
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,480
I hope so.
但愿如此

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,210
In the meantime I need to go find some lost things.
现在 我要去找一些人们的弃物了

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,450
Hold on, little miss spare parts.

66
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,150
You're not going near the human house, are you?
你别去人类的房子附近 你会吗?

67
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,720
- There's a human house? - No! I mean, yes, but no.
- 那里有人类的房子? - 不! 我是说 是的 也不是

- 我们要与人类保持距离 - 噢 伊瑞蒂瑟

69
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,580
- Tinker Bell knows that, don't you? - Define "stay away"

70
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,300
It's gonna be a long summer.
呃 这将是一个难熬的夏天

71
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,500
Grouchy.
生气了

72
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,980
- Oh, that's just Vidia being Vidia. - No, the air. It smells...
- 噢 维蒂亚就是这样 - 不 这气氛 闻起来...

73
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,580
...grouchy.
...可不怎么样

74
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,050
- We might be in for a storm. - Come on Sil.

76
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,810
Tinker Bell.
这个叮当

77
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,060
Thank goodness we're here, Father. It's just like I remember it.
谢天谢地我们到家了 爸爸 和我记得的一样

78
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,960
Wel, of course, my darling.
是的 当然 我亲爱的

79
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,790
Look at the creek and the woods and the meadow
瞧这小河、大树 还有草地

80
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,560
Oh! I wish it was summer all year long!
噢! 真希望全年都是夏天!

81
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, Lizzy.
是的 莉兹

82
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,320
Tinker Bell, what are you doing here?
叮当 你在那里做什么?

83
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,530
Vidia, this is amazing! It's a carriage that moves by itself!
维蒂亚 真奇妙 这是一个自己走的车!

84
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,840
There's no horse. Seriously, look.
真的不用马 瞧

85
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,030
- Do you see a horse up there? - Uh, No.
- 你看到这里有马吗? - 呃 没有

86
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,200
It'is a horseless carriage! And do you want to know how it works?
这是一个无马车! 你想知道他是怎么走吗?

87
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,110
- Not really. - So do I.
- 不怎么想 - 可是我想

88
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,550
I think those wheels back there move because this chain thing rotates
我觉得后面的那些轮子动 是因为这个链着的东西在转

89
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,610
And I think what rotates the chain is this big...
我还觉得转这个链子的是这个大...

90
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,380
I don't care Tinker Bell. You shouldn't be this close to the human house.
管他呢 叮当 你不应当离人类的房子这么近

91
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,290
What if they see us?
如果他们看到我们 会怎样?

92
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,120
Will you stop flitting around in there? This is serious!
你别在那里飞来飞去了 听到吗

93
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,300
You know what, Vidia? I think this powers the whole thing!
你知道吗 维蒂亚? 我觉得是这家伙给整个车提供动力

94
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,640
This, my dear, is exactly why tinkers shouldn't come to the mainland. They...
天呀 这就是为什么修理匠不应该 派到这个大陆来 他们...

95
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,740
Let me know if this does anything.
让我看看这是做什么的

96
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,660
Well, anything? Vidia, you're all wet.
好了 有什么动静吗? 维蒂亚 你都湿透了

97
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,560
You don't say.
你还说

98
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,060
Father, Father Father! Can we bring our tea and scones outside
爸爸 爸爸 爸爸! 我们可以把茶点拿到外面吗?

99
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,650
and have them here in the garden?
在花园里面吃?

100
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,320
- It would be just like a little picnic. - Not just now, Lizzy.
- 就像野餐一样 - 现在不行 莉兹

101
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,100
I still have to get the trunk unpacked and the house settled
我还在卸行李 拾掇房子

102
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,430
Father, look! What a magnificent butterfly.
爸爸 看 多么特别的一只蝴蝶

103
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,200
My word. Absolutely astonishing.
额的神呀 绝对怪异

104
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,370
It's so beautiful. What kind of butterfly is it?
它真漂亮 它是什么品种?

105
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,010
Well, judging from the epidermal membrane, it's cleary an apatura iris,
好的 根据外形来看 它显然是紫闪蛱蝶

106
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,520
but the wings have two entirely different patterns.
但这两个翅膀呈现完全不同的图案

107
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,080
Well, that's neary impossible.
当然 这几乎不可能

108
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,690
Well, I guess that's just the way the fairies decided to paint it.
好吧 我猜是仙子们决定这么画的

109
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,750
Hmm?
嗯?

110
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Lizzy, faires do not paint butterfly wings
莉兹 蝴蝶翅膀不是仙子们画的

111
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,530
because, as you know, fairies are not real.
因为你知道的 仙子并不是真的

112
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,760
- Hmm! - Ugh!
- 嗯! - 呃!

113
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,100
But of course they are. The proof is right here.
可他们当然是真的 这就是证明

114
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,770
- Their paint dripped all over its wing. - Really, darling.
- 他们的颜料滴在这整个翅膀上了 - 是吗 亲爱的

115
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,870
Rational people consider a belief in fairies to be quite foolish.
理性的人们相信仙子是相当愚蠢的

116
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,110
The wings are so fresh.
这翅膀可真鲜见

117
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,440
What are you doing?
你在做什么?

118
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,610
Its chrysalis must have been in the meadow.
它的茧一定是在草地上

119
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,420
The meadow? Father wait!
草地? 爸爸! 等等!

120
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,130
That's where I'm going. Would you like to come?
我正要去那里 你也来吗?

121
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,390
Not now, Lizzy. I have to update my field journal.
现在不行 莉兹 我要去整理我的野外日志

122
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,090
My interview at the museum is tomorrow night
明天晚上我要去博物馆开会

123
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,570
You're going back already? We just got here.
你刚回来呀 我们才到这里

124
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,060
I know, sweetheart, and I'm very sorry. But I'll only be gone for the day.
我知道 乖乖 真对不起 但我只是白天到那里去

125
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,340
Mrs. Perkins will look after you, and I'll be back in time to tuck you in.
伯金斯太太会照顾你的 我也会按时回来送你上床睡觉

126
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,850
- Promise? - I promise.
- 一定? - 我肯定

127
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,650
- Okay. - That's a good girl.
- 那好吧 - 真是好囡囡

128
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,030
All clear!
安全了!

129
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,790
Come on, Vidia.
来呀 维蒂亚

130
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,700
- I can't fly. My wings are wet. - Oh! That's right. Sorry.
- 我飞不动 我的翅膀湿了 - 噢! 是呀 真抱歉

131
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,100
Guess you'll have to walk back.
我想你只好走回去了

132
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,440
But don't worry, I'll keep you company. Actually, it might be nice
不过 别担心 我会陪你的 实际上 这样可能更好

133
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,980
Or not So, I think I figured out the carriage.
也许不好 那我就明白这个车了

134
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,350
Those bottles of goop must keep it running smoothly,
这些粘湿的东西一定是用来保持平顺运行的

135
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,550
like snail slime, you know?
就像蜗牛的粘液 你知道吗?

136
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,120
Hate to see the size of the snail that stuff comes from. And at first...
那东西如果来自蜗牛 可蜗牛太小了 那么 最初...

137
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,470
Here's your house, little fairies. Wherever you are.
小仙子 不管你们在哪里 这是你的房子

138
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,010
Hmm Just needs a little something more.
嗯 还少了一点东西

139
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,940
But I haven't quite figured out what that sparky wire does.
但我还不知道那个闪电的线是做什么的

140
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,680
Hey! Maybe the whole carriage runs on lightning!
哎 也许整个车子是靠闪电运行

141
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,290
Are those wet wings still bugging you? Here, Vidia, let me help you.
你的湿翅膀还不能用吗? 这样 维蒂亚 我来帮你

142
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Tinker Bell, maybe if you spent less tme causing disasters,
小叮当 也许你可以少闯点祸

143
