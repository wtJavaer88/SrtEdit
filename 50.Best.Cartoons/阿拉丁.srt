贾西姆显然还达不到那条标准

-灾难临头却诡计多端 -无赖!
-  One trick ahead of disaster - Scoundrel!

155
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,790
他们很快,但是我更快
 They're quick, but I'm much faster

156
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,595
快来啊,来抓我啊
 Here goes, better throw my hand in

157
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:14,126
希望我能快乐地着陆 我需要做的只是纵身一跃
 Wish me happy landin' All I gotta do is jump 

158
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:16,669
[尖叫声]
[screaming]

159
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:24,246
[肥料, 打折]
[guards] Yuck! Oy!

160
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,285
现在,尊敬的先生,我们尽情享受吧
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.

161
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,219
现在,尊敬的先生,我们尽情享受吧
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.

162
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,845
好吧
All right.

163
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:33,287
好吃,好吃!
[Abu] Yum, yum!

164
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,529
Uh-oh.

165
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,666
[叹息声]
[sighs]

166
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:59,510
给你.拿去吧
Here. Go on. Take it.

167
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,483
[giggling]

168
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,518
[groans]

169
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,532
Ah, don't. Huh?

170
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,006
我想他一定是去皇宫
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

171
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:29,205
又来一个向公主求婚的人
Another suitor for the princess.

172
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,976
- [giggling] - [woman screams]

173
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,779
别挡道,小毛孩
- [whinnying] - Out of my way, you filthy brats.

174
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,319
Hey!

175
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,156
如果我象你那样有钱 我会懂点礼貌
If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners.

176
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:42,125
我来教你礼貌
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

177
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:43,785
[男人的笑声]
[men laugh]

178
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:46,728
[grimacing]

179
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,628
看那儿,阿布
Look at that, Abu.

180
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,036
这可是非常罕见的 一匹马有两个屁股
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.

181
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,526
[crowd] Ooh!

182
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:56,596
你是个没教养的叫化子
You are a worthless street rat.

183
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:59,973
你生来就是个叫化子 死了还是个叫化子
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat,

184
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:03,172
只有你身上的跳蚤会为你送葬
and only your fleas will mourn you.

185
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,251
我有教养
I'm not worthless.

186
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,549
而且我身上没跳蚤
And I don't have fleas.

187
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,284
快点,阿布 我们回家吧
[sighs] Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

188
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:26,462
无赖,叫化子
 Riffraff, street rat

189
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:28,869
我不信
 I don't buy that

190
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,705
只要他们看清楚
 If only they'd look closer

191
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:36,975
难道他们只看见个穷孩子
 Would they see a poor boy

192
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,776
不,先生
 No, siree

193
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:44,286
他们会发现
 They'd find out

194
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:48,121
还有很多东西
 There's so much more

195
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:51,355
在我身上
 To me 

196
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,688
[叹息声]
[sighs]

197
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,638
总有一天,阿布, 事情会有所改变
Some day, Abu, things are gonna change.

198
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,706
我们会变得富有,住在皇宫里
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

199
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:07,044
不再有任何麻烦
and never have any problems at all.

200
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,944
[天亮了]
[roosters crowing]

201
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:12,483
我从来没有被这么羞辱过
I've never been so insulted.

202
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:16,387
阿赫麦德王子 你这么快就走了?
Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you?

203
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:18,556
祝你走运,能把她嫁出去
Good luck marrying her off.

204
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:21,150
噢!茉莉.
Oh! Jasmine.

205
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,518
茉莉!
[Sultan] Jasmine!

206
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,495
茉莉!
Jasmine!

207
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,589
茉莉!
- Jasmine! - [snarling]

208
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,793
该死的!拉扎
Confound it, Rajah.

209
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:37,341
原来这就是阿赫麦德王子 大发雷霆的原因
So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out.

210
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,831
父亲
Oh, Father.

211
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,742
拉扎只是和他逗着玩 对吧,拉扎?
Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah?

212
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,114
你只是和那个衣冠楚楚
You were just playing with that overdressed,

213
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,878
自恋狂的阿赫麦德王子逗着玩,对吗?
self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?

214
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:48,384
[both laughing]

215
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,751
[clears throat]

216
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:55,315
亲爱的,你不能拒绝每一个前来求婚的人
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.

217
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:59,260
法律上规定..你必须嫁给一个王子.
The law says you must be married to a prince...

218
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,297
在你下一个生日
by your next birthday.

219
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,822
法律是错的
The law is wrong.

220
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,164
你只剩下三天了
You've only got three more days.

221
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:08,899
父亲,我讨厌被逼迫着嫁人
Father, I hate being forced into this.

222
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:12,272
如果我嫁人,那一定是为了爱
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

223
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,504
茉莉...
Jasmine...

224
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:17,775
不只是因为那条法律
it's not only this law.

225
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:24,446
我不能照顾你一辈子, 并且,我...
I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I...

226
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:28,184
我只想确认有人能照顾你
I just want to make sure you're taken care of.

227
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,658
早点做准备
Provided for.

228
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,457
请你理解我
Please try to understand.

229
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,884
我从没有自己拿过主意 我也未曾有过真正的朋友
I've never done a thing on my own. I've never had any real friends.

230
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:37,926
[嘟囔声]
[grumbles]

231
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,594
除了你,拉扎.
Except you, Rajah.

232
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:44,241
我甚至从没踏出过这宫殿的围墙
I've never even been outside the palace walls.

233
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,709
但是,茉莉,你是公主啊
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

234
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:49,712
那我不想当公主了
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.

235
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,647
我...我...
Oooh! I... I...

236
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,810
真主啊,但愿你没有女儿
Allah forbid you should have any daughters.

237
00:13:55,886 --> 00:13:57,353
嗯?
Hmm?

238
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,463
我不知道她这是象谁
I don't know where she gets it from.

239
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:15,528
她妈妈可没这么挑剔
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

240
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,131
贾法尔.
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

241
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,769
我最信任的大臣
My most trusted advisor.

242
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,748
我确实需要你给我出个主意
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

243
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:27,512
我生来就是为您效劳的,国王陛下
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

244
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,279
就是求婚的事
It's this suitor business.

245
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,844
茉莉不愿选一位丈夫
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

246
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:34,914
-我已经绞尽脑汁了. -绞尽脑汁!
- I'm at my wit's end. - Awk! Wit's end!

247
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,857
[laughing] Oh!

248
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:41,496
-吃块饼干吧,亲爱的波利
- Have a cracker, pretty Polly. - [Jafar laughs]

249
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:44,864
陛下对付不会讲话的动物 确实有办法啊
Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.

250
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,095
[grumbles]

251
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,664
那么对于这个棘手的问题
Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution

252
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,868
也许我可以用占卜术 找出办法来
to this thorny problem.

253
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,535
如果有人可以帮忙的话, 那就是您了
If anyone can help, it's you.

254
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:59,742
需要借用一下那颗神秘的蓝宝石
But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.

255
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:02,718
噢,我的戒指?
Oh. Uh, my ring?

256
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,222
但它可是我的祖传宝贝啊
But it's been in the family for years.

257
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:08,487
要想为公主找到一个求婚者 它是必需的
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.

258
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,356
别担心

259
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:14,090
一切都会好的
Everything will be fine.

260
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,724
一切都会...好的
Everything will be... fine.

261
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,893
宝石
The diamond.

262
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,494
在这儿,贾法尔.
Here, Jafar.

263
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:25,008
不管你要什么我都给你
Whatever you need will be fine.

264
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,805
您真是太伟大了,国王陛下
You are most gracious, my liege.

265
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:31,541
现在,您可以玩您的小玩具了
Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?

266
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:35,142
对,那真是太好了
Yes. That will be pretty good.

267
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,344
[spits, coughs]

268
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:40,515
我再也无法忍受了!
I can't take it anymore!

269
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:46,797
如果再硬塞给我那些发霉的、 讨厌的饼干的话...
If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

270
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,890
我打!打!
Bam! Whack!

271
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,331
安静些,拉戈
Calm yourself, lago.

272
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,803
我就要篡夺他的王位了
Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack!

273
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:56,707
不久国王就是我了, 不再是那个糟老头子了
Soon I will be sultan, not that addle-pated twit.

274
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:01,076
到时候我会把饼干塞进他的喉咙里
And then I stuff the crackers down his throat.

275
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,669
Ha, ha!

276
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:19,557
[whining]

277
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,690
对不起,拉扎
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

278
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:25,929
我不能再呆在这儿, 象现在这样过一辈子
But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.

279
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,064
我会想你的
I'll miss you.

280
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:38,437
[whimpers]

281
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,278
再见了

将你的爪子拿开

可爱的小姐,买个壶吧

00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,269
不.不对

301
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:40,742
- Oh! - [gulping]

302

00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:07,670
你一定是饿了
Oh, you must be hungry.

309
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,399
拿去吧
Here you go.

310
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:12,636
你最好把钱给我
You'd better be able to pay for that.

311
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:13,911
钱?
Pay?

312
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:16,004
没人能从我的货车里偷走东西
No one steals from my cart.

313
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,843
对不起,先生 我没带钱
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.

314
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,349
-小偷! -求求你...
- Thief! - Please...

315
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:24,444
如果你让我进到皇宫里 我可以从国王那里拿钱给你
If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.

316
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,790
你知道对于小偷是如何惩罚的吗?
Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

317
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,519
别!别,求您了!
No! No, please!

318
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:31,662
谢谢,您真是个好人 很高兴你帮我找到她了
Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her.

319
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,653
我一直在到处找你
I've been looking all over for you.

320
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,823
-你在干什么? -快点配合一下
- What are you doing? - Just play along.

321
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,265
你,认识这个女孩?
You, uh, know this girl?

322
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:40,929
是的,她是我.
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

323
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,596
她有点疯疯癫癫的
She's a little crazy.

324
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,542
她说她认识国王.
She said she knew the Sultan.

325
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,375
她认为这只猴子就是国王
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

326
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,043
英明的国王,我愿为您效劳
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

327
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:57,109
[gibberish]

328
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:59,485
悲剧,您说呢?
Tragic, isn't it?

329
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,581
但是没什么伤害
But no harm done.

330
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,491
现在,,咱们走吧 该去看医生了.
Now, come along, sis. Time to go see the doctor.

331
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,130
医生，你好
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?

332
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,759
-不,不,不.不是他 -快点,国王
- No, no, no. Not that one. - Come on, Sultan.

333
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,132
[gibbering, gasping]

334
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:15,198
什么?
Huh? What?

335
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,736
回来,你这个小偷!
Come back here, you little thieves!

336
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,838
[爆炸声]
[explosion]

337
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,646
请恕我冒犯,你这个烂人,
With all due respect, Your Rottenness,

338
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:29,311
难道我们要等真正的风暴吗?
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

339
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:31,377
闭嘴,拉戈.再快点
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

340
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:35,154
遵命,你个大魔头
Yes, O mighty Evil One.

341
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:36,283
[panting]

342
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:40,720
到时候了
Part, sands of time.

343
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:44,961
告诉我谁能进入奇幻谷
Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.

344
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:48,368
对!对!
Yes! Yes!

345
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,838
就是他
There he is.

346
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,273
深藏不露的家伙
My diamond in the rough.

347
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:56,938
就是他?那个乡巴佬? 他就是我们要找的人?
That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for?

348
00:19:57,014 --> 00:20:03,283
我们派卫兵去请他来皇宫,是吗?
Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?

349
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:04,945
对极了
Swell.

350
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,717
[coughs]

351
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,918
[sinister laughter]

352
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,984
快到了
Almost there.

353
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:22,772
我要谢谢你帮我拦住了那家伙
I want to thank you for stopping that man.

354
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,500
不用谢
Uh, forget it.

355
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:29,940
你是第一次来市场,对吗?
So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?

356
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,875
有那么明显吗?
Is it that obvious?

357
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:36,009
是啊,你确实有点与众不同
Well, you do kind of stand out.

358
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:42,518
我是说,你不知道 阿古拉巴有多危险
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.

359
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:45,186
我学的很快哟
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

360
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,752
Wow.

361
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,058
[chuckling] Hey.

362
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,192
来.走这边
Come on. This way.

363
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,330
小心别碰头
Whoa. Watch your head there.

364
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:57,964
小心!
Be careful.

365
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,838
你就住在这里?
Is this where you live?

366
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,107
是.只有我和阿布,来去自由
Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

367
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,148
难以置信
That sounds fabulous.

368
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:09,481
还有呢,这里位置绝佳
Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view.

369
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:13,415
皇宫看起来是多么壮观啊
Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

370
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,288
是很棒
Oh, it's wonderful.

371
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,487
我想不出在那里面 是什么样
I wonder what it would be like to live there,

372
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:21,053
有仆人服侍你
and have servants and valets.

373
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:24,794
是啊.总有人告诉你要去哪儿、 该穿什么衣服
Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

374
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,336
比这里好
It's better than here.

375
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,202
你总是要省吃俭用, 还要提防那些卫兵
You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.

376
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:32,503
这里你无法自己作主
You're not free to make your own choices.

377
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:35,170
-有时你会觉得... -你只是...
- Sometimes you feel so... - You're just...

378
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,509
...被困住了
[both]...trapped.

379
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,849
你从哪儿来?
[clears throat] So, where are you from?

380
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,579
这重要吗?
What does it matter?

381
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:49,250
我从家里跑出来,我不想再回去了
I ran away and I am not going back.

382
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:51,920
真的?怎么会呢?
Really? How come?

383
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:53,656
为什么?你...
Why, you...

384
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,996
我父亲非逼我嫁人
My father's forcing me to get married.

385
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,866
那...那真是太可怕了
That's... that's awful.

386
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:05,430
阿布!
- [Aladdin] Abu! - [angry squeaking]

387
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,704
它说什么?
What?

388
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:11,441
阿布说... 那不公平
Abu says, uh... that's not fair.

389
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:12,607
什么?
What?

390
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:15,082
-真的? -当然了
- Oh, did he? - Yeah, of course.

391
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:19,022
阿布还说了别的什么吗?
And does Abu have anything else to say?

392
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:22,626
我想,他想帮你做点什么
Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.

393
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,685
天哪！
Oh, boy.

394
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,388
Hmm.

395
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:29,990
告诉他，那可太好了
Tell him that's very sweet.

396
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:33,692
你在这儿
Here you are.

397
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,274
-他们在抓我!是在抓你? -一定是我父亲派来的...
- [both] They're after me! After You? - My father must have sent them...

398
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,536
-你相信我吗? -什么?
- Do you trust me? - What?

399
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,634
-你相信我吗? -是...
- Do you trust me? - Yes...

400
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:44,303
那么,跳!
Then jump!

401
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:53,219
我们一直在相互较量,对吗? 叫化子?
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?

402
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,115
快跑!快!离开这!
Run! Go! Get out of here!

403
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:58,700
快把这个东西给我拿开!
Get this thing off of me!

404
00:22:58,728 --> 00:23:01,665
-你等着进地牢吧,臭小子 -放开我
- It's the dungeon for you, boy. - Get me off

405
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:02,996
放了他
Let him go.

406
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:07,560
快看啊,一个叫化子
- Looky here, men. A street mouse. - [guards laugh]

407
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:11,232
放开他,这是公主的命令
Unhand him, by order of the princess.

408
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:14,373
茉莉公主
Princess Jasmine.

409
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,207
-公主? -公主?
- The princess? - [Abu] Princess?

410
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,339
你在皇宫外面干什么? 还和一个叫化子
What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.

411
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:23,216
那和你没关系 照我说的做,放开他
That's not your concern. Do as I command. Release him.

412
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:27,518
遵命,公主, 只是这是贾法尔的命令
I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar.

413
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:31,527
-您必须让他同意才行 -相信我,我会的
- You'll have to take it up with him. - Believe me, I will.

414
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,667
贾法尔?
Jafar?

415
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:41,533
噢,公主
Oh, Princess.

416
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:44,039
贾法尔,我被卡住了
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

417
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:46,337
愿为您效劳
How may I be of service to you?

418
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:49,742
卫兵刚在市场上抓走了个男孩, 是你的命令
The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.

419
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:54,079
是您父亲让我负责 维持阿古拉巴的秩序
Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.

420
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,675
-那个男孩是个罪犯 -他犯了什么罪?
- The boy was a criminal. - What was his crime?

421
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,084
憋死我了,贾法尔
I can't breathe, Jafar.

422
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:01,749
当然是绑架公主了
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.

423
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:04,157
如果你能... 疼死了!
If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

424
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:06,923
他没有绑架我, 是我自己跑出来的
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

425
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:09,932
天哪!
Oh, dear.

426
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,300
这太让我意外了 我要是早知道...
Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known...

427
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,599
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

428
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:19,267
很不幸,那个男孩的判决 已经执行了
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

429
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:20,809
什么判决?
What sentence?

430
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,868
死刑
- Death. - [gasping]

431
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:25,938
-杀头 -不
- By beheading. - No.

432
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:32,053
我非常抱歉,公主
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

433
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,818
你怎么能?
How could you?

434
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,688
[weeping]

435
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:40,558
[咳嗽声]
[coughing]

436
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,589
[coughing, gasping]

437
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:46,761
就这么走了?
So, how did it go?

438
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:50,533
我想她会接受... 这个事实的
I think she took it... rather well.

439
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,969
[Jasmine crying]

440
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,081
都是我的错,拉扎.
It's all my fault, Rajah.

441
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:11,853
我连他的名字都不知道
- I didn't even know his name. - [Rajah murmuring]

442
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,714
她是公主
She was the princess.

443
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,148
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

444
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,550
我早应该看出来的, 看她有多笨
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

445
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,021
阿拉丁!
[Abu] Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

446
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,421
你好!
Hello!

447
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,221
阿布.下来.
Abu. Down here.

448
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,455
[squeaking]

449
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,554
快点,帮我逃出去
Come on, help me out of these.

450
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,759
[斥责声]
[scolding]

451
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:59,376
可是当时她遇到麻烦了 是啊,那是她自找的
Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

452
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,241
对,对,对
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,404
别担心,我再也不会见到她了
Don't worry. I'll never see her again.

454
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,916
我是个叫化子,对吗? 有条法律
I'm a street rat, remember? And there's a law.

455
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,076
她必须嫁给王子
She's gotta marry a prince.

456
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:13,522
她应该嫁给一个王子
- She deserves a prince. - Ta-da!

457
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,649
我真是个傻瓜
I'm a, I'm a fool.

458
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:19,661
孩子,如果你放弃的话 你就真是个大傻瓜
[man] You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

459
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:20,991
你是谁?
Who are you?

460
00:26:21,064 --> 00:26:24,500
一个囚犯,象你一样
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

461
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,502
但如果我们合作的话,也许会得到很多
But together, perhaps we can be more.

462
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,868
我正在听着呢
I'm listening.

463
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:33,898
孩子,有一个谷名叫奇幻谷
There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders,

464
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:38,141
那里堆满了你永远 也想象不到的金银财宝
filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.

465
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:39,943
Ooh!

466
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:44,009
我敢打赌,那些财宝足以打动你的公主
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.

467
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,723
贾法尔,能不能快点? 我快要闷死了
Jafar, can you hurry up? I'm dyin' in here.

468
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:49,351
但是法律规定只有王子才能...
- [squawking] - But the law says only a prince can...

469
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:52,328
你听说过"有钱能使鬼推磨"吗?
You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?

470
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:54,831
谁有钱谁就能制定法律
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

471
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:56,230
[wheezing laugh]

472
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:59,597
你为什么会和我分享 这些金银财宝?
Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?

473
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:04,232
我需要一双年轻的腿 一个强壮的身体才能进到谷里
I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.

474
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:05,968
还有一个问题
Uh, one problem.

475
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,101
那个谷在外面,我们却还在这里
It's out there. We're in here.

476
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:12,945
事情远非看起来那样简单
Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem.

477
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,814
那么...
So...

478
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,944
一言为定?
do we have a deal?

479
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:20,387
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

480
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:22,322
[电闪雷鸣]
[thunder crashing]

481
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:35,202
是谁把我吵醒了?
Who disturbs my slumber?

482
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:40,204
是我,阿拉丁
Uh, it is l, Aladdin.

483
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:44,279
进去吧
Proceed.

484
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:48,374
除了神灯不要碰别的东西
Touch nothing but the lamp.

485
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:51,682
记住,孩子,先把神灯给我
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp,

486
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:55,714
你会得到奖赏的
and then you shall have your reward.

487
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,555
走吧,阿布
Come on, Abu.

488
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,397
[squeaking]

489
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,236
你看到了吗
- Would you look at that! - [whimpering]

490
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:21,482
只要得到这里的一点财宝， 我就会比国王还富
Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the Sultan.

491
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:23,382
阿布!
Abu!

492
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,545
[报怨声]
[whines]

493
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,351
别...碰...任何东西
Don't... touch... anything.

494
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:29,118
我们要找那神灯
We gotta find that lamp.

495
00:28:29,192 --> 00:28:30,853
[嘟囔声]
[grumbles]

496
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,277
Huh?

497
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,181
-阿拉丁! -阿布,别闹了行吗?
- Aladdin! - Abu, will you knock it off?

498
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,780
[screeches]

499
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,384
阿布,你疯了吗?
Abu, what are you, crazy?

500
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,714
一个魔毯
A magic carpet.

501
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:38,227
过来.快过来. 我们不会伤害你的
Come on. Come on out. We're not gonna hurt you.

502
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:47,463
[screeches]

503
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:51,107
别紧张,阿布.他不咬人
Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not gonna bite.

504
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:52,369
谢谢
Thanks.

505
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:54,967
[squeaking]

506
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,580
等一下.别走
Wait a minute. Don't go.

507
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:04,586
也许你能帮我们
Maybe you can help us.

508
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,418
Hey! Whoa!

509
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:12,086
你看,我们正在找神灯
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

510
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:17,298
我想它知道神灯在哪儿
- I think he knows where it is. - [squeaks excitedly]

511
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,964
[echoes]

512
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:34,015
在这儿等着
[whispers] Wait here.

513
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,712
[moaning]

514
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,557
Oh!

00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,312
就是这个?
This is it?

516
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:12,786
这就是我们翻山越岭 来到这儿要找的...
This is what we came all the way down here to...

517
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:14,789
阿布!不要!
Abu! No!

518
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,352
你背叛了我!
- [cave] lnfidels! - Uh-oh.

519
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:23,491
你动了那些不能碰的财宝!
[cave] You have touched the forbidden treasure!

520
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:31,005
你再也见不到阳光了!
Now you will never again see the light of day!

521
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:32,830
Whoa!

522
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:56,465
救命!救命!救命!
Help! Help! Help!

523
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:03,162
抓到了!
Gotcha!

524

飞毯,我们走
Carpet, let's move.

525
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,558
阿布!
Abu!

526
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:28,722
阿布,别慌
Abu, this is no time to panic.

527
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:30,792
我也开始怕了
Start panicking.

528
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,892
[both] Whoa!

529
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:41,243
[Abu panting]

530
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:48,546
[thunder cracks]

531
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,449
[roaring]

532
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:04,300
-救我出去 -把神灯扔过来

先给我神灯

00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,966
[maniacal laughter]

536
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,807
对!

537
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:19,313
终于得到了!
At last!

538
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,146
- [wicked laughter] - [Aladdin struggles]

539
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:23,879
你想干什么?
What are you doing?

540
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:26,421
给你奖赏
Giving you your reward.

541
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:29,356
你最终的奖赏
Your eternal reward.

542
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:33,290
[screaming]

543
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:36,795
[yelling]

544
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:48,366
[roaring]

545
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:57,282
[chuckling]

546
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:58,944
它是我的了
It's mine.

547
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:01,422
全是我的
It's all mine.

548
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:04,360
我...哪去了?
I... where is it?

549
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,554
不

550
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,721
不!
No!

551
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:14,663
茉莉?
Jasmine?

552
00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:18,997
亲爱的
[Sultan] Oh, dearest.

553
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:20,736
怎么了?
What's wrong?

554
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,300
[sniffling]

555
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,370
贾法尔他已经...
Jafar has...

556
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,814
做了件很坏的事
done something terrible.

557
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:30,717
来,来,我的宝贝
There, there, my dear.

558
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:33,152
我们把它纠正过来
We'll set it right.

559
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:36,749
现在,把一切都告诉我
Now, tell me everything.

560
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:40,324
Oh.

561

阿拉丁
Aladdin.

563

我的头
Oh! My head.

564

我们被困住了
We're trapped.

565
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:55,100
那个狗娘养的阴险家伙!
That two-faced son of a jackal!

566
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:56,645
[snarling]

567
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:59,977
不管他是谁, 他已经带着神灯跑掉了
Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.

568
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,280
Aha!

你这个小毛贼
[chuckling] Why, you hairy little thief.

570
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:09,884
看起来象个不值钱的垃圾
Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.

571

嗨!这上面写着字
Hey, I think there's something written here,

572
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:15,794
可是看不太清
but it's hard to make out.

573
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:30,069
Aaaaahhhhh!

574
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,307
Oy!

575
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:37,080
一万年,我的脖子都变僵硬了
1 0,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck.

576
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:38,586
吊一会儿
Hang on a second.

577
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:41,646
Whoa! Whoa!

578
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,715
外面感觉真是棒

女士们、先生们,很高兴能回来
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.

580
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:48,157
你从哪来?你叫什么名字?

581

嗯...阿拉丁

阿拉丁.你好,阿拉丁. 欢迎来参加演出
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show.

Can we call you "Al"? Or maybe just "Din."

584
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:58,741
-叫"老弟"怎么样?听起来象… -过来,老弟
How about "Laddie"? Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."

585
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,370
看来我头受的伤, 比想象的要严重
I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

586
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,403
你抽烟吗?我抽烟你不介意吧?
Do you smoke? Mind if I do? [giggling]

587
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:08,075
对不起,飞毯 希望没烧着你的毛
Oh, sorry, Cheetah. Hope I didn't singe the fur.

拉格曼.已经有上千年没见你了
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia.

589
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:14,582
把你的手给我
Give me some tass-el. Yeah. Yo, yo.

590
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:18,149
你可比我上一任主人小多了
Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.

591
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:21,831
或是我变大了, 你看看,我看上去不一样吗?
That or I'm gettin' bigger. Look from the side. Do I look different to you?

592
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,891
等一下,我是你的主人?
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

593
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,959
是的.孺子可教, 你希望我长什么样?
That's right. He can be taught. What would you wish of me?

594
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:30,335
令人印象深刻的
The ever impressive,

595
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:33,239
还是循规蹈矩的
the long contained,

596
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:34,674
或者是千变万化的
often imitated,

597
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,712
但是永远都不会重复...
but never duplicated...

598
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,838
重复,重复...
[echoing] Duplicated, duplicated...

599
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,506

好,知道了, 我正在想许什么愿才好
Now I know I'm dreaming.

610
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:01,537
主人,我想你还不知道 你能从我这里得到什么
Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here.


611
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:05,564
主人,我想你还不知道 你能从我这里得到什么
Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here.
612
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,975
那你为什么不好好考虑一下
So why don't you just ruminate

613
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,969
让我来显示一下我的能力
whilst I illuminate the possibilities.

614
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:14,575
阿里巴巴有40大盗
 Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

615
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,430
天方夜谭有一千零一个故事

你的朋友能吐火吗
 Can your friends go poof

看这.哈哈!
Hey, looky here. Ha ha!

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,967
你的朋友会念咒语吗, 让她裂开
 Can your friends go Abracadabra, let her rip

646
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,369
会让这些小傻瓜消失吗
 And then make the sucker disappear

647
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:43,038
别坐在那儿吊着下巴、 瞪着眼睛
 So don't you sit there Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

我列了个清单,大概有三里长

654
00:38:57,787 --> 00:39:00,022
你所要做的就是象这样磨擦
 All you gotta do is rub like so

00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:03,890
尊敬的阿拉丁先生, 许一个愿或二个或三个

Ah ha ha!

665
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,968
- Wah ha ha! - [greedy laugh]

666
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:26,879
从没有朋友象我这样
 You ain't never had a friend like me 

667
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,818
- [buzzing] - [weak applause]

668
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:28,874
- [buzzing] - [weak applause]

669
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,818

那么,你的愿望是什么,主人?

差不多
Ah, almost.

673
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:42,998
还有一些条件，做为交换

比如?

00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,591
第一条:我不能杀人
Ah, rule number one:. I can't kill anybody.

676
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,967
所以不要为难我

680
00:39:56,645 --> 00:40:00,979
第三条:我不能让死人复活
Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead.

681
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,281
这可不是什么好看的图画, 我不喜欢干这个
It's not a pretty picture. I don't like doing it.

682
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:06,685
除了那些,什么都行
Other than that, you got it.

683
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,552
- Hmm. - Oh!

684
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:13,829
条件?你是说 实现愿望还有限制?

你可真是个万能的精灵

686
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:19,635
连让人死而复生都不行
Can't even bring people back from the dead.

687
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:23,405
不行啊,阿布.他可能都 无法让我们离开奇幻谷
I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave.

688
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:25,670
看起来我们要 想法找到出去的路
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out.

689
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,642
请原谅?
Excuse me?

690
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,702
你是在看我吗? 你磨擦神灯了吗?
Are you lookin' at me? Did you rub my lamp?

691
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:33,577
是你唤醒了我? 是你带我到这里来的?
Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here?

692
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:35,674
现在却突然抛下我就走?
And all of a sudden you're walking out on me?

693
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:38,948
那可不行,现在还不是时候
I don't think so, not right now.

694
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,114
你的愿望即将实现,快坐下!
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!

695
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,784
在发生危险时
- [Abu screeches] - In case of emergency,

696
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,225
紧急出口会在这,这,这,这, 在任何地方
the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere.

697
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:48,923
把你的手和胳膊放在飞毯里
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.

698
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:50,966
我们就要...
We're...

699

出去了!
outta here!

700
00:40:54,503 --> 00:40:54,603
贾法尔,这是一桩暴行
[Sultan] Jafar, this is an outrage.
[Sultan] Jafar, this is an outrage.

701
00:40:54,603 --> 00:40:58,164
贾法尔,这是一桩暴行

702
00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:01,310
如果不是看在你多年来的忠诚...
If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...

703
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:05,406
从现在开始, 罪犯宣判前你必须先请示我
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,

704
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:08,041
特别是他们被杀头前
before they are beheaded.

705
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:11,052
我向您保证,陛下, 这不会再发生了
I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.

706
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,417
茉莉...
Jasmine...

707
00:41:12,488 --> 00:41:17,585
贾法尔.让我们把这件事全都忘了吧
Jafar. Let's put this whole messy business behind us.

708
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,752
求求你
Please.

709
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:22,923
我最最诚恳地向您表示歉意,公主
My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.

710
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:26,263
看来我被逼成婚至少还有些好处
At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.

711
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:30,465
当我成了女王,我就有权除掉你
When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.

712
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:32,200
[chuckles nervously]

713
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:34,868
好极了,所有的问题都解决了
That's nice. All settled, then.

714
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:38,141
茉莉,你该再考虑一下婚姻大事了 茉莉?
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine?

715
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,404
茉莉!
Jasmine!

716
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:42,609
[growls]

717
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:46,246
如果我得到了那盏神灯
If only I had gotten that lamp.

718
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:49,587
"我就有权除掉你"
"l will have the power to get rid of you."

719
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:52,728
现在我们只能继续讨好
[growling] To think we gotta keep kissing up

720
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,687
那个糟老头还有他那个笨女儿
to that chump and his chump daughter

721
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:59,461
-在我们的有生之年... -不,拉戈.
- for the rest of our lives... - No, lago.

722
00:41:59,535 --> 00:42:03,130
一旦她找到一个蠢丈夫
Only until she finds a chump husband.

723
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:05,070
那么她就会被流放
Then she'll have us banished.

724
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,768
或者砍头
Or beheaded.

725
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:09,777
[both] Eww!

726
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:11,779
等等
Oh. Wait a minute.

727
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:15,840
贾法尔.你来做那个傻丈夫怎么样?
Jafar. What ifyou were the chump husband?

728
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,044
什么?
What?

729
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,756
说错了,应该是你来娶公主如何?
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?

730
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:24,522
然后,你就会成为国王
And, uh, then you become the sultan.

731
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:25,958
Oh.

732
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:28,553
娶那个泼妇
Marry the shrew.

733
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:31,065
我将成为国王.

734
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:34,159
-这个想法有点意思 -对,有点意思
- The idea has merit. - Yes, merit. Yes.

735
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:41,165
然后我们就把岳父大人 和那个女人一起抛下悬崖
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff.

736
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:42,767
对!
Yaaah!

737
00:42:42,845 --> 00:42:44,904
太棒了!
Kersplat!

738
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,504
[wicked laughter]

739
00:42:46,582 --> 00:42:49,818
我喜欢 你这个小烂脑袋里的想法
I love the way your foul little mind works.

740
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,616
[both laugh sinisterly]

741

感谢您乘坐魔毯旅行
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs.

745
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,934
现在,怎么样, 还怀疑我的能力吗?
Well, how about that, Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

746
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:14,076
你确实很行 现在来说说我的三个愿望吧
Oh, you sure showed me. Now, about my three wishes.
Oh, you sure showed me. Now, about my three wishes.

747
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:18,877
你确定很行 现在来说说我的三个愿望吧

748
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:21,108
我没听错吧?
Dost mine ears deceive me?

749
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:23,686
三个?你已经实现一个愿望了
Three? You are down by one, boy.

750
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:27,452
不.我可没有许愿要离开奇幻谷
Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave.

751
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,286
那是你自己愿意做的
You did that on your own.

752
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:34,227
可是,我真是太笨了
Well, I feel sheepish.

753
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:37,633
好吧,你这个坏家伙 下次可不会再有这么好的事了
All right, you baaad boy, but no more freebies.

754
00:43:37,633 --> 00:43:40,932
这才公平嘛.那么还有三个愿望
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

755
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:42,994
我一定要好好利用它们
I want them to be good.

00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:44,801
你有什么愿望?
What would you wish for?

757
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,864
我?
Me?

758
00:43:46,942 --> 00:43:49,137
以前从来没人问过我.
No one's ever asked me that before.

759
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:52,146
在我看来... 还是忘了吧
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

760
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,205
-什么? -不,我不能.我...

自由
Freedom.

763
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,754
你曾经是囚犯吗?
You're a prisoner?

764
00:43:59,822 --> 00:44:02,357
那是整个精灵世界 的一个重要法则
It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig.

765
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:06,088
拥有无穷的力量...
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

766
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:07,526
但却必须挤在小小的灯里
Itty bitty living space.

767
00:44:07,596 --> 00:44:09,791
精灵,那太糟了
Genie, that's terrible.

768
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:12,390
可是,我要是自由了
But, oh, to be free.

769
00:44:12,468 --> 00:44:14,800
就不用整天说 "你需要什么?"
Not have to go, "Poof. What do you need?

770
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,532
"你需要什么?" "你需要什么?"
Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need?"

771
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:19,506
我想主宰我自己
To be my own master.

772
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:22,411
真能那样的话, 要比得到这世上所有的魔法
Such a thing would be greater than all the magic

773
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:25,180
和所有的金银财宝还要好
and all the treasures in all the world.

774
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,115
可是我在说什么呢? 还是回到现实吧
But what am I talking about? Let's get real here.

775
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:29,582
这是不可能的
It's not gonna happen.

776
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:31,846
精灵,还是醒醒吧
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

777
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,285
为什么?
Why not?

778
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:37,189
我从神灯里出来的唯一方法 就是我的主人许愿让我出来
The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.

779
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,659
你知道这根本不会发生
So you can guess how often that's happened.

780
00:44:39,728 --> 00:44:41,457
我会的,我会让你获得自由
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

781
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,864
真的,我发誓
- Uh-huh, yeah, right. - No, really, I promise.

782
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,765
在我实现前两个愿望后
After I make my first two wishes,

783
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:51,101
我会用第三个愿望让你自由
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

784
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:53,375
好吧,至少还有些希望
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

785
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,707
让我们施点魔法吧
Let's make some magic.

786
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:58,508
怎么样?你最想要什么?
So how 'bout it? What is it you want most?

787
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,414
就是那女孩
Well, there's this girl.

788
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:03,815
不行
Wrong.

789
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:06,446
我不能让人们相爱,还记得吗?
I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?

790
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:07,989
但是,精灵,
Oh, but, Genie,

791
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:10,991
她聪明、风趣...
she's smart and fun and...

792
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:13,095
-漂亮? -是美丽!
- Pretty? - Beautiful.

793
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:16,656
她的眼睛象...她的头发
She's got these eyes that just... and this hair. Wow.

794
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:19,064
还有她的微笑...
And her smile... [sighs]

795
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,704
这就是爱
Ami.

796
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:22,630
C'est l'amour.

797
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:24,763
可是她是个公主
But she's the princess.

798
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,831
只要有机会,我一定要...
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...

799
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:29,844
你能把我变成王子吗?
Hey, can you make me a prince?

800
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:31,436
让我查一下
Let's see here.

801
00:45:31,513 --> 00:45:34,277
皇家奶油鸡?不对
Chicken a la king? Nope.

802
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:37,580
阿拉斯加王蟹,我讨厌它
Alaskan king crab. Ow. I hate it when they do that.

803
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:40,355
凯撒色拉 还有你,布鲁特?不对
Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.

804
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:43,586
在这呢."如何成为王子"
Aha. "To make a prince."

805
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,889
这是你正式的愿望吗? 我可要念咒语了
Is that an official wish? Say the magic words.

806
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:48,828
精灵,我希望你将我变成王子
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.

807
00:45:48,897 --> 00:45:50,558
好吧!
All right!

808
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:51,963
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

809
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:55,401
首先,那个服装柜是三世纪的
First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century.

810
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,870
瞧这些补丁 我们要变成什么,乞丐?
These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar?

811
00:45:57,973 --> 00:46:00,441
不.还是让我来吧
No. Let's work with me here.

812
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:03,673
太棒了.象个男子汉.
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

813
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,640
现在,还需要点别的 书上是怎么说的来着?
Now, it still needs something. What does it say to me?

814
00:46:06,648 --> 00:46:09,446
是交通工具
It says mode of transportation.

815
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:12,385
请原谅,小猴子,到这来
Excuse me, monkey boy. Aqui. Over here.

816
00:46:12,454 --> 00:46:14,354
-看他来了
- Uh-oh. - [Genie] Here he comes.

817
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:17,551
当你走进阿古拉巴的街道
What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah

818
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:21,494
没有比骑着自己的 新骆驼更好的了
than riding your very own brand-new camel.

819
00:46:21,563 --> 00:46:24,967
当心!它们会到处乱吐 这不行
Watch out. They spit. Mmm. Not enough.

820
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:27,162
这也不好
Still not enough.

821
00:46:27,236 --> 00:46:29,033
让我想想,你需要什么?
Let's see. What do you need?

822
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:31,732
对!
Yes!

823
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:35,174
是一头大象.
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

824
00:46:35,244 --> 00:46:37,269
- Whoa! - [trumpets]

825
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:41,474
看看你的象鼻子 检查一下你的动作
Talk about your trunk space. Check this action out.

826

[trumpets]

827
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,311
[frightened monkey noises]

828
00:46:46,622 --> 00:46:48,749

带上你的头巾 我们要把你变成一个名星

00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:10,638
陛下,我找到了解决 您女儿婚姻的方法

835
00:47:13,348 --> 00:47:14,576
真的?
Oh, really?

836
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,811
就在这
Right here.

837
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:19,820
"如果公主没能在规定时间 找到一个合适的丈夫
"lf the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,

838
00:47:19,888 --> 00:47:24,291
那么国王就必须为他指定一个"
then the sultan shall choose for her."'

839
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:27,192
可是茉莉对所有的求婚者都不满意
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

840
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:29,492
我怎么能指定一个她讨厌的人呢
How could I choose someone she hates?

841
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:32,533
别担心,国王.下边还有呢
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

842

"如果没有找到一个合适的王子"
"lf in the event a suitable prince cannot be found,"

843
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:37,661
Jerk.

844
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:41,732
"公主必须嫁给..."'
"a princess must then be wed to..."'

845
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,210
嗯.有意思
Hmm. Interesting.

846
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:46,042

宰相
The royal vizier.

848
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,341
也就是...我
Why, that would be... me.

849
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,218
可是我认为法律上好象说
But I thought the law says

850
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,655
只有王子才能娶公主
that only a prince can marry a princess.

851
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:58,225
我确信...
I'm quite sure that...

00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,196
非常时期要用非常方法,国王.
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.

853
00:48:02,264 --> 00:48:05,461
是啊.非常时期

854
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:09,664

00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,955
阿里王子
Prince Ali Ababwa.

916
00:51:24,032 --> 00:51:27,695
当然可以,很高兴见到你
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

917
00:51:27,769 --> 00:51:30,966
这是我的大臣,贾法尔. 他也很高兴
This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He's delighted, too.

918
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,269
我欣喜若狂
Ecstatic.

919
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:36,174
-我想,阿布王子... -是阿里.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo... - Ababwa.

920
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:37,575
不管叫什么
Whatever.

921
00:51:37,646 --> 00:51:40,615
没有受到邀请 你不能在这里游行而且还想...
You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...

922
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,981
真主啊,这真是个不同寻常的东西
By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.

923
00:51:44,052 --> 00:51:45,576
Ooh.

924
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:49,283
我想,我是否可以...
I don't suppose I might...

925
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:53,054
当然了,陛下 请允许我
Why, certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.

926
00:51:53,128 --> 00:51:56,222
陛下,我必须给您一个忠告
Sire, I must advise against this.

927
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:59,562
别说了,贾法尔. 要学会给自己找点乐趣
Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

928
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,193
Ow, ow, ow.

929
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:03,567
Ahh! Whoa!

930
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:12,436
你刚才说是从哪里来的?
Just where did you say you were from?

931
00:52:12,514 --> 00:52:17,542
很远的地方, 我敢肯定你一定没到过那儿
Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.

932
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:19,553
-说来听听. -当心,波利.
- Try me. - [Sultan] Look out, Polly.

933
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:23,791
小心
Hey, watch it.

934
00:52:23,858 --> 00:52:26,094
小心这个不会说话的飞毯
Watch it with the dumb rug.

935
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:28,028
Aah!

936
00:52:28,096 --> 00:52:30,189
Whew!

937
00:52:34,836 --> 00:52:38,101
别挡道,我要下来了
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

938
00:52:38,173 --> 00:52:39,640
贾法尔,看看这个
Jafar, watch this.

939
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:42,143
-太神了,殿下 -太有趣了
- Spectacular, Your Highness. - That was lovely.

940
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:47,171
我确实找到了些窍门
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

941
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,615
你真是个令人印象深刻的年轻人.
This is a very impressive youth.

942
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:52,050
而且还是个王子
And a prince besides.

943
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,681
如果我们运气好的话, 你根本就不用娶茉莉了
[whispers] If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

944
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:58,487
-他有点可疑,陛下 -胡说
- I don't trust him, Sire. - Nonsense.

945
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,721
这点我很有自信,贾法尔,
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,

946
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:02,820
判断人的好坏我最拿手
I'm an excellent judge of character.

947
00:53:02,897 --> 00:53:05,957
最拿手 不可能!
Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

948
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:09,197
茉莉一定会喜欢他的
[Sultan] Jasmine will like this one.

949
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:11,796
我也非常肯定我会喜欢上茉莉公主
And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.

950
00:53:11,873 --> 00:53:15,707
不,殿下.我必须替公主说句话
Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

951
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:17,938
这位王子和其他的人没什么区别
This boy is no different from the others.

952
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:20,982
他凭什么认为配得上公主?
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?

953
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:23,916
陛下,我是阿里王子
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

954
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:27,318
只要让她见到我,我会赢得您女儿的
Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter.

955
00:53:27,389 --> 00:53:28,822
你怎敢
How dare you.

956
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,792
你们所有人 站在那儿就想决定我的未来?
All of you. Standing around deciding my future?

957
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:35,694
我不是一件战利品
I am not a prize to be won.

958
00:53:36,264 --> 00:53:38,255
亲爱的
Oh, dear.

959
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,733
别担心,阿里王子.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.

960
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:43,464
只要给茉莉些时间,让她冷静一下
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

961
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:48,805
我想应该和阿布王子说再见了
I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abooboo.

962
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:54,540
我该怎么办?
[Aladdin sighs] What am I gonna do?

963
00:53:54,616 --> 00:53:56,811
茉莉甚至连说话的机会都不给
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

964
00:53:56,918 --> 00:54:00,581
我早应该想到我不该许 这个想当王子的愚蠢愿望
I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.

965
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:02,681
[growling]

966
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:05,522
该你走了
So move.

967
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:08,585
Hey.

968
00:54:09,597 --> 00:54:10,962
是步好棋
That's a good move.

969
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:13,660
真不敢相信,我要输给一个飞毯了
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

970
00:54:13,735 --> 00:54:15,999
精灵,我需要帮助
Genie, I need help.

971
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:18,096
好的,主人.这是药方
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

972
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,198
如果你想追求那位小姑娘
If you wanna court the little lady,

973
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:22,209
你就必须做一个诚实正直的人
you gotta be a straight shooter.

974
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:24,211
-你听懂了吗? -什么?
- Do you got it? - What?

975
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:26,406
告诉他...
Tell her the...

976
00:54:26,481 --> 00:54:28,312
-...真相! -决对不行
-...truth! - No way.

977
00:54:28,383 --> 00:54:32,217
如果茉莉发现我只是个叫化子
If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat,

978
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:34,312
她一定会嘲笑我的
she'd laugh at me.

979
00:54:34,389 --> 00:54:36,880
女人最欣赏是可以为她带来快乐的男人
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.

980
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:42,119
阿尔,不开玩笑 你确实应该变回真正的自己
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.

981
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:44,222
那是我最后想做的
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

982
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:46,267
好了,我要去见她
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

983
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:50,964
我只是...我要变得温文尔雅,镇定自若
I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.

984
00:54:52,107 --> 00:54:54,200
我看起来怎么样?
How do I look?

985
00:54:54,976 --> 00:54:57,570
象个王子
Like a prince.

986
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:08,255
[叹息声]
[sighs]

987
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:12,449
茉莉公主?
- [Aladdin] Princess Jasmine? - [growling]

988
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,553
-是谁在那儿? -是我,阿里王子.
- Who's there? - It's me, Prince Ali.

989
00:55:16,631 --> 00:55:19,998
是阿里王子
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

990
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:21,797
我不想见你
I do not want to see you.

991
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:24,395
别,别,求你了,公主 再给我一次机会吧
No, no, please, Princess. Give me a chance.

992
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:26,963
-别打扰我 -下去,小猫眯
- [Jasmine] Just leave me alone. - Down, kitty.

993
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,532
我们的小情郎进行的怎么样了?
So, how's our little beau doing?

994
00:55:30,812 --> 00:55:33,406
好猫眯,快走开
- Good kitty, take off. - [Rajah growling]

995
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:34,914
走开,小猫眯
Down, kitty.

996
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,075
等等,等一下
Wait. Wait.

997
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:38,551
我们以前见过吗?
Do I know you?

998
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,088
没有.没有.
Uh, no. No.

999
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:45,456
你让我想起了曾经在市场上遇到的一个人
You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.

1000
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:48,018
市场?
The marketplace?

1001
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:50,997
我有许多随从为我到市场买东西
I have servants who go to the marketplace for me.

1002
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:55,263
我甚至有随从为我到市场上寻找仆人
Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants.

1003
00:55:55,336 --> 00:55:57,531
你遇到的肯定不会是我
It couldn't have been me you met.

1004
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:01,234
是啊.我想也不会是你
No. I guess not.

1005
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:03,938
够了,别说你了 该谈谈她了
[Genie] Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her.

1006
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:06,742
她聪明、有趣,那头发、那眼睛
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

1007
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:08,407
随便什么.选一个
Anything. Pick a feature.

1008
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:11,384
茉莉公主? 你非常...
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine? You're very...

1009
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:14,820
-美丽,高贵,准时 -...准时
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual. -...punctual.

1010
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:16,015
-准时? -对不起
- Punctual? - Sorry.

1011
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:19,518
-漂亮 -改的好
- Uh, beautiful. - Nice recovery.

1012
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,518
Hmm.

1013
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:21,824
你知道我也很有钱
I'm rich, too, you know.

1014
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:24,831
-是啊. -我是国王的女儿
- Yeah. - The daughter of a sultan.

1015
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,890
我知道
I know.

1016
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:30,631
对于能娶到我的王子来说 是很好的奖赏
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

1017
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:33,674
对.对.象我这样的王子
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

1018
00:56:33,741 --> 00:56:34,901
警报!警报!
Warning! Warning!

1019
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:38,104
是啊.象你这样的王子
Right. A prince like you.

1020
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:41,706
和其他那些我见过的自命不凡、 狂妄自大、装模作样的家伙
And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met.

1021
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:44,411
十万火急!十万火急!
Mayday! Mayday!

1022
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:47,148
从阳台上给我跳下去!
[Jasmine] Just go jump off a balcony!

1023
00:56:47,222 --> 00:56:49,383
-什么? -让她停下.让她停下!
- What? - Stop her. Stop her!

1024
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:51,789
-要我去螫她吗? -走开
- Want me to sting her? - Buzz off.

1025
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,523
好,我走 但是记住,"做回"你自己
Okay, fine. But remember, "bee" yourself.

1026
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:57,394
-对呀 -什么?
- Yeah, right. - What?

1027
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,694
你说对了
Uh... Uh, you're right.

1028
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:05,005
你不应该成为别人的战利品
[sighs] You aren't just some prize to be won.

1029
00:57:05,073 --> 00:57:07,906
你有权自由地做出选择
[Aladdin] You should be free to make your own choice.

1030
00:57:07,976 --> 00:57:09,273
我要走了
I'll go now.

1031
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:11,209
-不! -什么事?什么事?
- No! - What? What?

1032
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:12,541
你怎么...
How...

1033
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:15,174
你是怎么做的?
How are you doing that?

1034
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,810
-这是飞毯 -它真可爱
- It's a magic carpet. - It's lovely.

1035
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:18,920
你...
- [kisses] - You, uh...

1036
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,820
你...
- [kisses] - You, uh...

1037
00:57:20,889 --> 00:57:24,256
你不想骑一下试试吗?
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

1038
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:26,589
我们可以飞出皇宫看看外面的世界
We could get out of the palace, see the world.

1039
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:29,824
-它安全吗? -没问题.你相信我吗?
- Is it safe? - Sure. Do you trust me?

1040
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:33,724
-什么? -你相信我吗?
- What? - Do you trust me?

1041
00:57:35,637 --> 00:57:37,305
是的
Yes.

1042
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:37,703
是的
Yes.

1043
00:57:52,186 --> 00:57:56,145
我可以向你展示这个世界
 I can show you the world

1044
00:57:56,224 --> 00:58:00,593
晶莹,华丽,光彩夺目
 Shining, shimmering, splendid

1045
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:02,254
告诉我,公主
 Tell me, Princess

1046
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:08,291
上次释放你的心情是在什么时候
 Now, when did you last Let your heart decide

1047
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:12,328
我要让你睁开双眼
 I can open your eyes

1048
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:15,774
带给你一个又一个奇迹
 Take you wonder by wonder

1049
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:18,641
上面,侧面,还有下面
 Over, sideways and under

1050
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:22,581
在这魔毯上
 On a magic carpet ride

1051
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,518
一个全新的世界
 A whole new world

1052
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:30,285
一个新奇的观点
 A new fantastic point of view

1053
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:35,022
没人要来告诉我们 能或不能去哪儿
 No one to tell us no Or where to go

1054
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,826
或者告诉我们这只是在做梦
 Or say we're only dreaming

1055
00:58:37,899 --> 00:58:41,733
一个全新的世界
 A whole new world

1056
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:45,899
一个从未见过的光彩夺目的地方
 A dazzling place I never knew

1057
00:58:45,974 --> 00:58:50,411
当我高高地飞在天上 它是那么的清澈
 But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear

1058
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:54,881
现在我和你进入了一个全新的世界
 That now I'm in A whole new world with you

1059
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:58,282
现在我和你进入了一个全新的世界
[Aladdin]  Now I'm in A whole new world with you

1060
00:58:58,386 --> 00:59:02,322
不可思议的景象
[Jasmine]  Unbelievable sights

1061
00:59:02,357 --> 00:59:05,952
难以形容的感觉
 Indescribable feeling

1062

没有你,我只能是阿拉丁
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

1210
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:04,423
-阿尔,你已经赢了 -那是因为有你
- Al, you won. - Because of you.

1211
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:07,956
所有人都认为我什么都能办到, 那全是因为有了你
The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you.

1212
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:10,196
如果他们发现我不是真正的王子 那该怎么办
What if they find out I'm not really a prince?

1213
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:14,173
如果被茉莉发现了?我会失去她
What if Jasmine finds out? I'd lose her.

1214
01:08:14,241 --> 01:08:17,540
精灵,我不能 只凭我自己,我无法维持现在的样子
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.

1215
01:08:17,611 --> 01:08:20,375
我不能让你自由
I can't wish you free.

1216
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:25,316
好吧.我懂了 你欺骗了我们每个人
Fine. I understand. You've lied to everyone else.

1217
01:08:25,386 --> 01:08:27,183
我开始觉得受冷落了
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

1218
01:08:27,254 --> 01:08:30,815
现在,主人，如果你能原谅我
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.

1219
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,550
[sighing]

1220
01:08:34,628 --> 01:08:36,619
精灵,我真的很抱歉
Genie, I'm really sorry.

1221
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:37,755
[raspberry]

1222
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:41,562
好吧.那你就在里面呆着吧
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

1223
01:08:42,636 --> 01:08:44,570
你们有什么好看的?
What are you guys looking at?

1224
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:48,631
[whimpering, sniffling]

1225
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:50,939
我...对不起

1226
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:53,070
阿布,对不起.我不是...
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1227
01:08:53,147 --> 01:08:55,138
等等
Wait. Come on.

1228
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:00,543
[sighing]

1229
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:03,089
我这是在干什么?
What am I doing?

1230
01:09:03,157 --> 01:09:05,717
精灵说的对
[sighs] Genie's right.

1231
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:09,320
我应该将真相告诉茉莉
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

1232
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:12,763
阿里.阿里 你能过来一下吗?
[Jasmine] Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?

1233
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,199
好吧,来了
[sighing] Well, here goes.

1234
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:18,501

就在动物园的外面.快来啊
[imitates Jasmine] Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

1236
01:09:21,442 --> 01:09:23,501
我来了

1237
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,045
[wicked laughter]

1238
01:09:26,113 --> 01:09:29,310
你有麻烦了,粉红的家伙?
- [goofy chuckle] - You got a problem, Pinky?

1239
01:09:29,383 --> 01:09:31,112
Jerk.

1240
01:09:31,185 --> 01:09:32,675
[gleeful cackling]

1241
01:09:34,121 --> 01:09:36,715
宝贝,贾法尔见到你一定很高兴

贾法尔,你真是太好了
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

1245
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,468
有点太难为情了,我脸都红了
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

1246
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:52,462
阿古拉巴的臣民们
People of Agrabah,

1247
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:56,669
我女儿最终选定了一位求婚者
my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.

1248
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:59,212
茉莉.
- [crowd cheering] - [Aladdin] Jasmine.

1249
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,271
阿里,你去哪儿了?

1250
01:10:01,348 --> 01:10:03,612
茉莉,有件事我要告诉你

整个王国都在等着我父亲宣布呢

-你不明白... -祝你好运

1254
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:14,025
阿里王子
- [Sultan]...Ali Ababwa! - [cheering]

1255
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:15,789
Oh, boy.

1256
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:18,627
[cheering]

1257
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:22,692
看看他们,正为那小子欢呼呢
Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.

1258
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:22,870
让他们欢呼吧
Let them cheer.
Let them cheer.

1259
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,065
让他们欢呼吧

1260
01:10:26,273 --> 01:10:29,174
你知道,阿尔,我可要真的...
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

1261
01:10:29,243 --> 01:10:31,768
你好象不是他 今晚,阿尔
I don't think you're him. Tonight, the part of Al

1262
01:10:31,845 --> 01:10:35,110
将被一个高大、阴险、丑恶的男人所操纵
will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.

1263
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:38,049
-现在我是你的主人 -那正是我担心的
- I am your master now. - I was afraid of that.

1264
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:41,110
精灵,实现我第一个愿望

1265
01:10:41,188 --> 01:10:45,056
我要当尊贵的国王.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

1266
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:52,293
我的天哪
- Whoa! - Bless my soul.

1267
01:10:52,366 --> 01:10:54,266
这是什么?
What is this?

1268
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:57,498
怎么回事? 我的天,出什么事了?
What's going on? Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

1269
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:59,595
父亲
Father.

1270
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,665
[cackling]

1271
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:04,905
贾法尔,你这个卑鄙的叛徒
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

1272
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:07,947
应该说是卑鄙的国王叛徒
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

1273
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:10,108
我们走着瞧
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

1274
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:13,085
神灯
- [gasps] The lamp. - [Jafar laughs]

1275
01:11:13,153 --> 01:11:16,520
发现者,监护者,阿布布
Finders keepers, Abooboo.

1276
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:24,257
[whistles]

1277
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:27,533
[people screaming]

1278
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,466
精灵,不!
Genie, no!

1279
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,135
对不起,孩子 我现在有了新主人
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

1280
01:11:37,211 --> 01:11:40,408
贾法尔,我命令你马上停止
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1281
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:42,608
可是现在有了新的王法
Ah, but there's a new order now.

1282
01:11:42,683 --> 01:11:44,480
我的王法
My order.

1283
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,611
最终,你会拜倒在我的脚下
Finally, you will bow to me.

1284
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:49,622
我们决不低头
We will never bow to you.

1285
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,817
这我一点也不奇怪?
Why am I not surprised?

1286
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,360
如果你不愿跪倒在国王面前
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1287
01:11:54,428 --> 01:11:57,625
那么你会在巫师面前发抖!
then you will cower before a sorcerer!

1288
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,995
精灵,我的第二个愿望...
Genie, my second wish...

1289
01:12:00,033 --> 01:12:04,436
我要成为世界上法力最强的巫师!
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!

1290
01:12:06,273 --> 01:12:08,571
精灵,停下!
- [Jafar laughs maniacally] - Genie, stop!

1291
01:12:08,642 --> 01:12:11,577
女士们,先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1292
01:12:11,645 --> 01:12:17,174
多情的阿古拉巴将欢迎巫师贾法尔!
a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!

1293
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:19,242
刚才,我们说到哪儿?
Now, where were we?

1294
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,949
对.卑躬屈膝
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

1295
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:29,295
走开
- Down, boy. - [meows]

1296
01:12:29,363 --> 01:12:30,625
公主
Oh, Princess.

1297
01:12:30,697 --> 01:12:33,598
我非常想给你介绍一个人
There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.

1298
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,259
贾法尔.把你的手拿开
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

1299
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:37,326
阿里王子,对,就是他
 Prince Ali Yes, it is he

1300
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:39,531
可他不是你了解的那个
 But not as you know him

1301
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:43,838
看着我的嘴,我要告诉你真相
 Read my lips And come to grips with reality

1302
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:47,037
是的,回想一下过去
 Yes, meet a blast from your past

1303
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:49,605
谁的谎言编的这么好
 Whose lies were too good to last

1304
01:12:49,683 --> 01:12:53,141
向亲爱的阿里王子问声好
 Say hello To your precious Prince Ali

1305
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,814
或者我们应该叫他阿拉丁?
Or should we say Aladdin?

1306
01:12:55,923 --> 01:12:56,912
阿里?
Ali?

1307
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:00,188
茉莉,我曾想告诉你 我只是...
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...

1308
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:04,697
阿里王子其实只是阿拉丁
 So Ali turns out to be Merely Aladdin

1309
01:13:04,765 --> 01:13:06,892
这只是个骗术,还要我继续吗
 Just a con, need I go on

1310
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,265
相信我
 Take it from me

1311
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:11,634
他品行恶劣
 His personality flaws

1312
01:13:11,705 --> 01:13:13,730
给了我充分的理由
 Give me adequate cause

1313
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:16,708
让他收拾行李来一次单程旅行
 To send him packing On a one-way trip

1314
01:13:16,777 --> 01:13:19,143
他的命运将急转直下
 So his prospects Take a terminal dip

1315
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:24,378
他的财产被冻结, 他要被送到在世界的尽头
 His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!

1316
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,851
-再见! -再见,再见.
- So long! - Good-bye, see ya.

1317
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,947
前阿里王子
 Ex-Prince Ali 

1318
01:13:32,426 --> 01:13:34,257
[laughing maniacally]

1319
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:53,910
[wind howling]

1320
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:55,539
[shivering]

1321
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,643
阿布
Abu.

1322
01:14:00,254 --> 01:14:01,915
阿布!
Abu!

1323
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,824
[Abu whimpering]

1324
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,092
这都是我的错
Oh, this is all my fault.

1325
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:12,359
我应该放了精灵 我曾有过机会.阿布
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance. Abu.

1326
01:14:12,432 --> 01:14:15,890
你没事吧?
- Are you okay? - [teeth chattering] Mm-hmm.

1327
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:17,903
对不起,阿布.
I'm sorry, Abu.

1328
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:20,701
事情全让我给搞砸了
I made a mess of everything.

1329
01:14:20,774 --> 01:14:24,369
也许...我应该回去把它纠正过来
Somehow... I gotta go back and set things right.

1330
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,217
飞毯
Carpet.

1331
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:37,416
- [Abu chitters] - [Aladdin strains]

1332
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:39,956
阿布,快来挖
Abu, start digging.

1333
01:14:40,027 --> 01:14:41,153
[frantic panting]

1334
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,261
就是它
That's it.

1335
01:15:01,548 --> 01:15:04,517
好了!
Yeah! All right!

1336
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:06,610
[whines]

1337
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:12,691
现在,我们回阿古拉巴 出发
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

1338
01:15:15,596 --> 01:15:18,326
你这个木偶国王要不要来点饼干?
- [lago] Puppet ruler want a cracker? - [Sultan moaning]

1339
01:15:18,398 --> 01:15:21,196
这是你的饼干,给我全都紫氯
Here's your cracker. Shoved all the way down your throat.

1340
01:15:21,268 --> 01:15:22,599
这儿,还有更多
Here. Have lots.

1341
01:15:22,669 --> 01:15:26,298
停下.贾法尔,放开他
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

1342
01:15:26,373 --> 01:15:28,273
[growling]

1343
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:32,403
茉莉看见你变成这样我很难过
It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.

1344
01:15:34,314 --> 01:15:36,782
象你这样一朵沙漠中的美丽之花
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself

1345
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:40,718
应该投入世界上最有权势的男人的怀抱
should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.

1346
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:42,721
你说什么,亲爱的?
What do you say, my dear?

1347
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:45,553
如果你同意成为我的王后...
Why, with you as my queen...

1348
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:47,685
休想
- Never. - [enraged growl]

1349
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:50,423
我会教你如何尊重我
I'll teach you some respect.

1350
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:51,725
[喘息声]
[gasping]

1351
01:15:53,233 --> 01:15:55,394
不.精灵.
No. Genie.

1352
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,995
我决定许最后一个愿
I have decided to make my final wish.

1353
01:15:59,072 --> 01:16:02,064
我要让茉莉公主
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1354
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:05,134
发狂地爱上我
to fall desperately in love with me.

1355
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:14,910
主人,还有些附加条件, 有一些限制...
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo...

1356
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,047
别跟我顶嘴,你这个兰色的傻大个
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.

1357
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:22,152
奴仆,你必须照我说的做

我无法帮你
Al, I can't help you.

1369

I work for Senor Psychopath now. What are you gonna do?

1370
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:05,929
我是个叫化子,还记得吗? 我要来个即兴表演
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise.

1371
01:17:06,006 --> 01:17:09,567
你的牙是那么的可爱
[Jasmine]...cute little gaps between your teeth.

1372
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:11,577
继续说
Go on.

1373

你已经偷走了我的心 贾法...!
- You've stolen my heart. - [gasping] Jaf...!

1376
01:17:22,856 --> 01:17:26,553
还有那个叫化子?
- [lago mumbling] - And the street rat?

1377
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:29,356
什么叫化子?
What street rat?

1378
01:17:31,965 --> 01:17:34,024
- [clattering] - [gasping]

1379
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,135
[gasping]

1380
01:17:38,138 --> 01:17:39,127
[both] Yech!

1381
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:42,466
那是...
That was...

1382
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:45,734
是你!
You!

1383
01:17:47,147 --> 01:17:51,106
我要杀你几次才行,小子?
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?

1384
01:17:54,054 --> 01:17:55,612
快拿神灯.
Get the lamp.

1385
01:17:57,157 --> 01:17:58,749
不!
No!

1386
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:01,487
公主 你的时间用完了
Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up.

1387
01:18:01,561 --> 01:18:03,961

干的好,贾法...
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

1390
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:14,172
别想耍我
Don't toy with me.

1391
01:18:15,075 --> 01:18:16,702
阿布!
Abu!

1392
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:20,110
小子,事情都清楚了
[Jafar] Things are unraveling fast now, boy.

1393
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:22,944
[Jafar laughing]

1394
01:18:23,016 --> 01:18:24,711
找到关键了吗?
Get the point?

1395
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,548
[laughing]

1396
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,281
[straining]

1397
01:18:30,757 --> 01:18:33,385
我只不过是热了热身
I'm just getting warmed up.

1398
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:39,028
你不敢自己跟我较量一下吗, 你这个胆小的毒蛇?
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?

1399
01:18:39,099 --> 01:18:39,199
一条毒蛇,我是吗?
A snake, am l?
A snake, am l?

1400
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,032
一条毒蛇,我是吗?

1401
01:18:42,102 --> 01:18:46,903
也许应该让你看看我是如何成为毒蛇的
Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be.

1402
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:04,251
[screaming]

1403
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:06,588
一二三四五六七 将那宝剑刺进蛇
 Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake Stick that sword into that snake

1404
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,218
这件事你别插手
You stay out of this.

1405
01:19:08,295 --> 01:19:12,696
贾法尔,贾法尔,他是我的偶像 如果他真能做到的话...太棒了!
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can't do it... great!

1406
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:17,629
阿拉丁
[Jasmine] Aladdin.

1407
01:19:23,844 --> 01:19:25,106
[screams]

1408
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:29,411
茉莉,支持住
Jasmine, hang on.

1409
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:34,751
你这小傻瓜
[laughing] You little fool.

1410
01:19:35,755 --> 01:19:40,124
你认为你可以击败这世界上最强大的人吗
You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth.

1411
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:44,459
勒死他,贾法尔. 勒死他就象...
Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a... Awk!

1412
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:48,558
没了精灵,小子,你就什么也不是
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

1413
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:51,798
精灵.精灵.
The genie. The genie.

1414
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:54,739
精灵比你的法力强多了
The genie has more power than you'll ever have.

1415
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:55,832
什么?
What?

1416
01:19:55,909 --> 01:19:58,309
你的法力是他给的,他也可以收回去
He gave you your power. He can take it away.

1417
01:19:58,378 --> 01:20:01,108
你在干什么? 为什么把我扯进来?
Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?

1418
01:20:01,181 --> 01:20:04,947
面对现实吧,贾法尔 你只能做老二
Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best.

1419
01:20:05,018 --> 01:20:07,384
你说的对
You're right.

1420
01:20:07,454 --> 01:20:11,220
他的法力确实比我强
His power does exceed my own.

1421
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,418
但这不会太久的
But not for long.

1422
01:20:13,493 --> 01:20:16,621
那孩子是疯了 他被打晕了
The boy is crazy. He's a little punch-drunk.

1423
01:20:16,696 --> 01:20:18,288
他被蛇打的太重了
One too many hits with the snake.

1424
01:20:18,365 --> 01:20:21,266
奴仆,我要许我的第三个愿望
Slave, I make my third wish.

1425
01:20:21,334 --> 01:20:25,600
我想做一个万能的精灵
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

1426
01:20:29,276 --> 01:20:33,042
你的愿望就是我的命令 干的好
All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.

1427
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:40,746
Yes.

1428
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,653
Yes!

1429
01:20:43,723 --> 01:20:45,350
法力
The power.

1430
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:48,417
- [Jafar laughs] - [Jasmine coughs]

1431
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:52,363
无敌的法力!
The absolute power!

1432
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,667
-你做了什么啊? -相信我
- What have you done? - Trust me.

1433
01:20:56,670 --> 01:21:00,868
宇宙将由我来控制
The universe is mine to command, to control!

1434
01:21:02,008 --> 01:21:04,772
不要太性急,贾法尔. 你没忘了什么吗?
Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something?

1435
01:21:04,844 --> 01:21:07,108
你想成为精灵...
- Huh? - You wanted to be a genie...

1436
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,477
你办到了
you got it.

1437
01:21:08,548 --> 01:21:09,810
什么?
What?

1438
01:21:09,883 --> 01:21:12,215
任何事都有它自己的法则
And everything that goes with it.

1439
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:15,846
-不!不! -我要离开这
- No! No! - I'm gettin' out of here.

1440
01:21:15,922 --> 01:21:17,947
拥有宇宙间无穷的力量...
[Aladdin] Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1441
01:21:18,024 --> 01:21:21,152
你是个精灵.我不想...
You're the genie. I don't want...

1442
01:21:21,227 --> 01:21:22,529
却必须挤在小小的灯里
Itty bitty living space.

1443
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:25,821
阿尔,你这个小天才
Al, you little genius, you.

1444
01:21:33,406 --> 01:21:35,465
- Ahh! - [meow]

1445
01:21:40,714 --> 01:21:43,316
[贾法尔]把你的臭嘴从我的脸上挪开
[Jafar] Get your blasted beak out of my face.

1446
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:46,653
-[拉戈]闭嘴,你这个笨蛋 -别对我说闭嘴
- [lago] Oh, shut up, you moron. - Don't tell me to shut up.

1447
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:47,984
让我来
Allow me.

1448
01:21:48,054 --> 01:21:52,423
在奇幻谷住上一万年 会让他安静下来的
10,000 years in a Cave ofWonders ought to chill him out.

1449
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:56,724
- [lago yelling, indistinct] - [Jafar] Shut up!

1450
01:22:01,968 --> 01:22:03,868
茉莉...
Jasmine...

1451
01:22:03,937 --> 01:22:07,429
对不起我向你撒了谎 说我是王子
I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.

1452
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:10,169
我理解你为什么那么说
I know why you did.

1453
01:22:10,243 --> 01:22:12,905
我想...
Well, I guess...

1454
01:22:12,979 --> 01:22:15,948
要说再见了?
this is good-bye?

1455
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:19,247
那个愚蠢的法律,这不公平
Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair.

1456
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:20,946
我爱你
I love you.

1457
01:22:21,021 --> 01:22:23,922
阿尔,没问题
[sniffles] Al, no problem.

1458
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:25,958
你还可以许一个愿望
You've still got one wish left.

1459
01:22:26,026 --> 01:22:28,256
你只需再许个愿, 你就又成为王子了
Just say the word and you're a prince again.

1460
01:22:28,328 --> 01:22:30,353
可是,精灵, 你的自由呢？
But, Genie, what about your freedom?

1461
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:33,524
那不过是永远当个奴仆
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1462
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,568
这可是爱
This is love.

1463
01:22:35,635 --> 01:22:40,038
再过一百万年 你也找不到象她这样的女孩了
Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.

1464
01:22:40,106 --> 01:22:43,940
相信我,我知道.我已经看过了
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1465
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:45,739
茉莉,我确实很爱你
Jasmine, I do love you,

1466
01:22:45,812 --> 01:22:49,646
可是我不能再伪装我自己了
but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not.

1467
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:52,048
我知道
I understand.

1468
01:22:53,787 --> 01:22:55,778
精灵,我许愿让你获得自由
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1469
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:58,949
一个拥有纯正血统的王子 就要出现了
One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.

1470
01:22:58,992 --> 01:23:02,928
-什么? -精灵,你自由了
- What? - Genie, you're free.

1471
01:23:22,949 --> 01:23:25,941
我自由了.我自由了
I'm free. I'm free.

1472
01:23:26,019 --> 01:23:28,544
快.快点 快许点不同寻常的愿望
Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous.

1473
01:23:28,621 --> 01:23:30,816
比如说,"我要尼罗河",试试
Say, "l want the Nile."' Try that.

1474
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:33,688
-我要尼罗河 -没门
- Uh, I wish for the Nile. - No way!

1475
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,159
[laughing gleefully]

1476
01:23:35,228 --> 01:23:37,822
这感觉真是太好了!
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1477
01:23:37,897 --> 01:23:41,162
我自由了!我完全自由了!
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1478
01:23:41,234 --> 01:23:43,725
我要到处流浪,我要看看外面的世界
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world.

1479
01:23:43,803 --> 01:23:45,532
我...
I'm...

1480
01:23:52,879 --> 01:23:54,870
精灵,我...
Genie, I'm...

1481
01:23:54,948 --> 01:23:57,542
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

1482
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:00,915
我也是
Me, too, Al. [sniffles]

1483
01:24:00,954 --> 01:24:04,082
不管别人怎么看
No matter what anybody says,

1484
01:24:04,157 --> 01:24:07,217
对我来说你永远都是一个王子
you'll always be a prince to me.

1485
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,454
这就对了
That's right.

1486
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:12,464
你已经证明了你的价值, 这正是我想要的
You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned.

1487
01:24:12,532 --> 01:24:15,933
这才是那法律的关键
It's that law that's the problem.

1488
01:24:16,002 --> 01:24:19,301
-父亲? -我是国王吗?我是国王,对吗?
- Father? - Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?

1489
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:20,964
从今往后
From this day forth,

1490
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,704
公主可以嫁给任何她认为值得嫁的人
the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.

1491
01:24:25,778 --> 01:24:28,246
他,我选择...

我选择你,阿拉丁
I choose you, Aladdin.

1493
01:24:33,953 --> 01:24:35,887
叫我阿尔
Call me Al.

1494
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:40,554
所有人,都过来 大团圆

1496
01:24:42,295 --> 01:24:44,263
我亲一下猴子不介意吧?
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1497
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:45,661
Ooh, hairball.

1498
01:24:45,732 --> 01:24:48,758
我不会再做危害大家的事了
Well, I can't do any more damage around this Popsicle stand.

1499
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:50,826
我要离开这儿!
I'm outta here!

1500

再见,你们这对恩爱小夫妻!

1501
01:24:53,406 --> 01:24:56,239
拉格曼,再见了 我是历史
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1502

1503
01:24:57,911 --> 01:25:00,937
我不在乎我是谁.我自由了!
