或像木乃伊 总之就是能一起玩牌的
or a mummy? Just, you know, somebody to play cards with.

161
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,160
你叫什么名字  女士?

不  不  不  我们是说 你的怪兽名
No, no, no. We mean your monster name.

164
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,490
像人们见到你后 尖叫时的名字?
Like, what do people scream when they see you coming?

165
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,630
就像: "看啊!这里有个.."

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,670
这一切都是幻觉
Don't scare Insectosaurus!

177
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,560
别吓坏虫怪索瑞斯
He's gonna pee himself,

178
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,420
他要是 自个撒尿  我们都会有麻烦

谁才是帅帅的虫子?
Who's a handsome bug, huh?

我搔你肚子时  你很享受吧?

Oh, thank goodness. A real person. You are a real person, right?

188
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,730
而不是半人半机器..你懂的?
Not one of those half-person, half-machine,

189

about monsters, and should focus on more important things, like paying taxes.

197
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,390
因此政府说服人们相信 怪兽是神话与传奇里的东西

并把怪兽关在这个机构

希望铀元素不会用在你身上

别把这里当监狱

把这儿当旅馆你永远不能离开

224

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,308
我不要以这种形式走入历史
Listen up. I'm not going to go down in history

291
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:33,600
一个在他的办公室眼睁睁
as the president who was in office

292
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,380
看着世界毁灭的总统
when the world came to an end,

293
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,450
所以大家敢紧想想办法
so somebody think of something, and think of it fast!

294
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,080
这卡布奇诺真不错 总统先生
- That is a good cup of joe. - Mr. President?

295
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,920
我不仅有个主意 还有个计划
Not only do I have an idea, but I have a plan!

296
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,070
常规武器用在那东西上 并没有效果
Now, conventional weapons have no effect on this thing,

297
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,430
而我们都知道 核武不是个好选择
- and we know nukes ain't an option. - Sure they are. I just...

298
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,050
-当然是好选择  按下.. -不  不  别按  等等
- Don't do it! Stop! - Wait!

299
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,210
我不是唬弄你  总统先生 前途暗淡 胜算并不大
I'm not gonna kid you, Mr. President. These are dark times.

300
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,150
我们需要圣母显灵
The odds are against us.

301
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,690
我们需要生力军  我们需要..
We need a Hail Mary pass. We need raw power! We need...

302
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,770
怪兽
...monsters.

303
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,700
怪兽!那当然了.. 太简单了
Monsters! Of course! It's so simple!

304
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,200
我..我没听懂你说的
I... I'm not following you.

305
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,520
这50年来 我掳获四处乱逛的怪兽
Over the last 50 years, I have captured monsters on the rampage,

306
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,370
把他们关押在一个秘密的监狱
and locked them up in a secret prison facility.

307
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,900
高度机密  所以连提及名字 都是犯了联邦罪
So secret that the mere mention of its name is a federal offense.

308
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,630
他不就正提到第50区..
Is he referring to Area Fifty...

309
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,510
总统先生 跟虫怪索瑞斯打声招呼吧
Mr. President, say hello to Insectosaurus!

310
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,350
蓉森小姐  拜托
Miss Ronson, please.

311
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,090
核子辐射将他从一只小虫
Nuclear radiation turned him from a small grub

312
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,400
变成一只350尺的巨大怪兽 导致东京遇袭
into a 350-foot-tall monster that attacked Tokyo.

313
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,030
而这个是 进化的失落环结
Here we have the Missing Link.

314
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,000
一个两万年前 被冰冻的老渔夫 被科学家们找到
A 20,000-year-old frozen fish man who was thawed out by scientists.

315
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,040
他逃脱了..继续在他的旧水域暴跳如雷
He escaped and went on a rampage in his old watering hole.

316
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,360
这个英俊的家伙是 卡克洛奇博士
This handsome fellow is Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.,

317
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,800
是世上最出色的男人
the most brilliant man in the world.

318
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,950
他发明了个科学仪器 要让人类
He invented a scientific machine

319
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,350
拥有小强般的顽强生命力
that would give humans the cockroach's ability to survive.

320
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,020
很不幸这个是副作用
Unfortunately, there was a side effect.

321
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,110
接着  这东西叫鲍伯
Now, we call this thing B.O.B.

322
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,860
能来个人把她赶出去吗?
Will someone get her out of here?!

323
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,280
谢了
Thank you.

324
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,470
在一次以蕃茄做 生物遗传改变的化学实验中
A genetically altered tomato was combined with a chemically altered

325
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,120
打算将一般农作物变成 顶级的餐后点心
ranch-flavored dessert topping at a snack food plant.

326
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,730
实验产生的湿黏物获得知觉
The resulting goop gained consciousness,

327
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,540
变成无以破坏的胶团
and became an indestructible gelatinous mass.

328
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,960
我们最近新加入的是 珍诺蜜卡
And, our latest addition, Ginormica.

329
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,720
将军  继续
General, continue.

330
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,790
她整个身体辐射出纯能量
Her entire body radiates with pure energy,

331
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,600
导致她有着巨大的力量和体积
giving her enormous strength and size.

332
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,870
长官  这些是我们最好和唯一
Sir, these monsters are our best and only chance

333
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,840
有机会击败机器人的怪兽
to defeat that robot.

334
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,510
对付外星人就够烦了  将军
Don't we already have an alien problem, General?

335
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,680
我不希望再多个怪兽麻烦
I don't think we need a monster problem, too.

336
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,160
你有更好的主意不成  笨蛋?
You got a better idea, nerd?

337
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,750
好吧  请留步
OK. Stay where you are.

338
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,110
将军  我保证会进一步讨论
General, I propose we go forward

339
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,750
怪兽大战外星人的构想  谢谢
with your monsters-versus-aliens idea... thingy.

340
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,590
翻牌
Go fish.

341
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,520
三张的?
...threes?

342
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,670
是的  我有  你是怎么办到的?
Yes. I do! How are you doing this?

343
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,760
你是我见过最幸运的家伙了
- You're the luckiest guy I know.

344
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:05,360
这跟运气可没什么关系
- Luck ain't got nothin' to do with it.

345
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,660
搞什..?嘿!
What the...? Hey!

346
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,870
他们说我疯了 我会向他们证明 我会向他们证明
They called me crazy, but I'll show them. I'll show them all!

347
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,820
博士  我希望你不要像个 疯狂科学家那样发笑
Doctor, I'd prefer you didn't do your mad scientist laugh

348
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,050
我身上可挂了连结仪器的电线
while I'm hooked up to this machine.

349
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,010
你是对的  虫怪
You're right, Insecto.

350
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,540
你已在那个愚蠢实验上 耗时一个多月了
You've let that quack experiment on you for over a month.

351
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,790
我不是愚蠢 我是个疯狂科学家 那可不同
I'm not a quack! I'm a mad scientist! There is a difference.

352
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,270
大伙儿  我能有什么选择?
Guys, what choice do I have?

353
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,090
如果他能把我变正常 或少个几尺
If he can make me normal, or even six foot eight,

354
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,050
我就能离开这儿 回到原来的生活
I can get out of here, get back to the life

355
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,430
得到原本该有的幸福
I'm supposed to have.

356
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,800
-我是说  我应该.. -我猜是:福雷兹诺?
- I should be in... - Let me guess, Fresno?

357
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,820
福雷兹诺只是个中继站 下一站是:密尔瓦基
Well, Fresno is just a stepping stone. Next stop, Milwaukee.

358
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,600
然后是纽约 但愿终有一天..
- Then New York, then hopefully...

359
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,240
是啊  我们都知道:巴黎
- Yeah, we know. Paris.

360
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,060
启动开关吧  博士 但别再那样发笑了
Throw the switch, Doctor, but don't do the laugh.

361
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,580
现在你会感觉到脑袋有些疼痛
Now you're going to feel a slight pinch in the brain.

362
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,500
抱歉
Sorry.

363
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,970
苏姗!哟呼!
Susan!

364
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,020
我变小了吗?
Am I small again?

365
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,270
恐怕没有  亲爱的
I'm afraid not, my dear.

366
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,450
事实上 你还多长了几尺
In fact, you may actually have grown a couple of feet.

367
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,950
没关系  博士  我们明天再试试
That's OK, Doc. We'll try again tomorrow.

368
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,980
你真的没搞懂是吧? 从来没有怪兽能离开这里
You really don't get it, do you? No monster has ever gotten out of here!

369
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,790
那不是事实 隐形人就办到了
That's not true! The Invisible Man did.

370
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,210
不  他没有
No, he didn't. We just told you

371
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,530
我们这么说  是不要你心烦
that so you wouldn't get upset.

372
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,620
他25年前遭到致命攻击而死
He died of a heart attack 25 years ago.

373
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,970
不!
No!

374
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,800
是真的 就在那张椅子
Yeah... in that very chair.

375
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,430
他还在那儿?
He's still there.

376
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,150
明白了吗? 没人离开过  也不会有人离开
You see what I'm saying? Nobody's leaving. Nobody's ever getting out.

377
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,440
好消息  怪兽 你们要出去了
Good news, monsters! You're getting out!

378
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,110
除了今天
Until today.

379
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,180
那么我挑明着说  蒙格
So let me get this straight, Monger.

380
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,890
你要我们去打外星机器人
You want us to fight an alien robot.

381
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,230
美国总统已授权我批准你们获释
And, in exchange, the president of these United States

382
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,130
以做为交换条件
authorized me to grant you your freedom.

383
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,380
啊  真不敢相信
I can't believe it!

384
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:32,130
很快我就能回到 德瑞克的怀抱里
Soon, I'll be back in Derek's arms... ...or he'll be in mine.

385
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,430
我等不及要在春假 回到可可海滩  只要..
I can't wait for spring break back at Cocoa Beach, just

386
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,540
引发人群骚动
freaking everybody out.

387
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,500
而我将回到实验室 继续完成我的实验
And I'll go back to my lab and finally finish my experiments.

388
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,350
不  不  你说的是我  鲍伯
No! That's me, B.O.B.

389
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,290
那么  我会成为..真正的女巨人
- Then I'll be a really giant lady.

390
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,960
那说的是苏姗  鲍伯
- That's Susan, B.O.B.

391
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,220
好吧  那我会回到莫德斯多 跟德瑞克在一起
Fine. Then I'll go back to Modesto and be with Derek.

392
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,890
呃..那说的还是苏姗  鲍伯
That's still Susan, B.O.B.

393
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,010
我想至少该给我个 和德瑞克在一起的机会
I think I, at least, deserve a chance to be with Derek!

394
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,490
行了  走吧
All right, let's go!

395
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,080
大家要有秩序的移动 这是紧急事件
Everybody move in an orderly fashion! This is an emergency!

396
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,090
我们将撤离城市
We are evacuating the city!

397
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,400
这是正确的抉择  但也非必要的
Exact change is appreciated, but not necessary!

398
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,890
前进吧!
Let's move out!

399
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,110
这是旧金山 离我家并不远
This is San Francisco! This isn't far from my home!

400
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,010
感受风吹拂你的触须 是不是很棒啊?
Feel the wind on your antennae. Isn this wonderful?

401
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,970
我有50年没到外头了 真令人兴奋
I haven't been outside in 50 years. It's amazing out here!

402
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,060
好像比以前热了点 地球是不是变暖了
It's hotter than I remember. Has the Earth gotten warmer?

403
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,450
知道这回事真棒 实在是个好现象
That'd be great to know. That would be a very convenient truth.

404
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,300
那就是机器人 好巨大
- Now that's a robot! - It's huge.

405
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,490
别把它破坏的太严重
Try not to damage it too much.

406
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,740
我想将它带回机构
I might want to bring it back to the farm!

407
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,990
不  不  等等 你并没说它有那么巨大
No, no, no, wait! You didn't say anything about it being huge!

408
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,390
等等  别离开
Wait! No! Don't leave!

409
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,020
我想他在看我们
I think he sees us.

410
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,510
你好!嘿! 最近怎样?
Hello! Hi! How you doing?

411
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,930
欢迎  我们打算摧毁你
Welcome! We are here to destroy you!

412
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,660
我不能跟那东西打 我甚至不能.. 我..我在气喘
I can't fight that thing. I can't even... I've never...

413
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,600
有人有巨大的袋子吗?
I'm hyperventilating. Does anybody have a giant paper bag?

414
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,690
放轻松
Relax.

415
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,850
情势都在我老林克的控制下
Old Link's got this under control.

416
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,440
躲到城市里头  苏姗 你会没事的
Hide in the city, Susan. You'll be safe there.

417
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,610
但要躲开那大块头 他会让人有些昏眩
But stay away from the Tenderloin! It's a little dicey!

418
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,030
终于要行动了 我要把那个超大马口铁罐塞入..
Finally, some action. I'm gonna turn that oversized tin can

419
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,340
..真正的马口铁罐里头
into a really dented oversized tin can.

420
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,600
好吧  谁知道虫怪索瑞斯在哪?
OK! Does anybody have a 20 on Insectosaurus?

421
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,110
哇  瞧这大尺寸的东西!
Wow! Would you look at the size of that...

422
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,110
我抓到它了  大伙儿  我抓..
I got him, you guys! I got...

423
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,280
别担心  我不会放它走 我要穿下它..
Don't worry, I won't let go! I'm wearing him down!

424
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,850
他慢下来了
Please tell me he's slowing down!

425
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,160
到城市去  林克 我会尽快赶上你
Get to the city, Link. I'll catch up with you as soon as I can.

426
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,710
也许..你得赶上我才是
Or maybe you'll have to catch up with me.

427
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,220
不  不
Oh, no! No, no, no!

428
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,160
行了  行了  控制住了
OK, OK. I got this.

429
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,340
没错  很痛
Yep, that hurt.

430
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,350
赶到了  我有个计划
Get in! I have a plan!

431
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,820
热狗
Hot dogs!

432
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,650
好了  林克 我会靠上去阻挡它
All right, Link, I'm going to pull up alongside it!

433
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,200
你就准备进入 它的中央处理系统 然后..
You get up in there, get to its central processing unit, and...

434
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,500
嘿  大伙儿  抓住我!
- Hey, guys, catch me! - No!

435
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,210
快点  快点  保持移动
Let's go, let's go! Keep it moving!

436
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,060
嘿  不要鸣喇叭
Hey! No honking!

437
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,860
抱歉  移开点 在你右边..控制不了
Excuse me! Coming through! On your right! No control!

438
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,580
好的  会没事的 听着  我要救你出来 忍耐着点
OK! It's going to be OK! Look, I'm gonna get you out of there!

439
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,100
你得离开这座桥 不然..
Hold on a second! We have to get off the bridge before...

440
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,630
不  不  不! 离我远点!
No, no, no! Get away from me!

441
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,570
只是经过  没事
Coming through! Watch it!

442
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,120
嘿  毛球  你跑去哪了?
Hey, furball, where you been?

443
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,360
是啊  我知道 爸爸让情势有些走样
Yeah, I know. Papa's a little out of shape.

444
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,780
拜托  他要杀了我
Excuse me! He's trying to kill me!

445
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,340
他为什么要这样做  为什么..?
Why is it doing that? Why would it...

446
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,650
你干得不错! 我什么都肯干!
- Wow. You're doing great! - I'm doing everything!

447
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,120
撑不久  来吧  大伙儿 我们来搞定这东西
Not for long. Come on, you guys. Let's take this thing down!

448
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,710
是防护罩  挺典型的
A deflector shield. Typical.

449
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,520
你是压不扁小强的
You can't crush a cockroach!

450
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,780
虫怪索瑞斯
Insectosaurus!

451
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,060
虫怪索瑞斯
Insectosaurus!

452
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,770
-鲍伯! -什么?
- B.O.B.! - What?

453
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,400
帮帮我! 抱歉
- Help me! - Sorry.

454
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,610
我在盯着那边的鸟儿
- I was staring at this bird over there.

455
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,530
我们得把桥上的人疏散
- Get these people off the bridge!

456
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,880
得令
Got it.

457
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,930
不  鲍伯  把护栏移开
No, B.O.B.! Move the dividers!

458
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,640
哦  是  你说的对 我失误
Oh, yeah, you're right. My bad.

459
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,480
快  快  快  快
Go, go, go, go!

460
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,990
林克!
Link!

461
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,790
哦  好不舒服
Oh, I don't feel good.

462
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,460
行的  苏姗  你办得到的
OK. Susan, you can do this.

463
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,420
好吧  我们来搞定这东西
All right. Let's take this thing down.

464
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,390
搜寻任务失败
Retrieval has failed.

465
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,190
别烦恼  常有的事
Don't get upset. It happens to everyone.

466
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:03,030
那个低阶生命体 还以她能偷走我的量子能?
That lower life form thinks she can steal my Quantonium?!

467
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,720
再另外派只去探寻!
Send another probe at once!

468
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,890
量子能无法经由机器人取回
Quantonium cannot be retrieved via robot.

469
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:14,070
名为苏姗的碳基生命体 现在太强大了
Carbon-based life form, locally known as Susan, is now too strong.

470
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,900
哦  你认为你够大够壮..
Oh, you think because you're all big and strong

471
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,070
..可以破坏我的探测机器人
and you can destroy my robot probe

472
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,260
然后要我又躲又藏的
that you're gonna send me running and hiding?!

473
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,640
我躲躲藏藏的日子结束了
My days of running and hiding are over!

474
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,640
电脑 设定前往地球的航道 我要亲自取回量子能
Computer, set a course to Earth. I will retrieve the Quantonium myself,

475
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,640
纵使要把她的身体 撕裂成小细胞,也得干
even if I need to rip it out of her body one cell at a time!

476
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,620
小心点  很热的
Careful, it's hot.

477
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,070
三个星期前 你若叫我去打败
Three weeks ago, if you had asked me to defeat a giant alien robot,

478
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,320
巨形外星机器人 我肯定回答:办不到
I'd have said, "No can do."

479
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,320
但我办到了 你们看到我那时有多神勇吗?
But I did it! Me! I'm still buzzing. Did you see how strong I was?!

480
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,990
这世上不可能 有我打不开的瓶子
Probably isn't a jar in this world I can't open.

481
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,370
你真是我的英雄  亲爱的
You were positively heroic, my dear.

482
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,330
我最欣赏你 拯救桥上人群的举动
I especially loved how you saved those people on the bridge.

483
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,380
很令人感动 她挺让人惊讶对吧  林克?
It was a nice touch. Wasn't she amazing, Link?

484
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:19,110
对呀  很了起 很酷  我爱死了
Yeah, she was great. Really cool. Loved it.

485
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:25,110
可怜的林克  经过这般讨论后 你被个女孩比了下去
Oh, poor Link. After all that tough talk, you were out-monstered by a girl.

486
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,310
难怪你会沮丧 嘿  我不是沮丧 只是累了
- No wonder you're depressed. - Hey, I'm not depressed. I'm tired.

487
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,560
你怎么会累? 你什么也没干
Why are you tired? You didn't do anything.

488
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,790
我从没那么好睡过  好吗? 我得了睡猿症
Well, I haven't been sleeping well.

489
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:39,360
睡猿..困猿.. 随便啦  很不受
I got sleep apnes... apnea. Whatever. It's not fun.

490
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,460
那么林克有些荒疏 我是说睡觉误事
So Link's a little rusty... I mean, sleep deprived.

491
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,460
不久你会恢复原来的样子 我也一样
You'll be back to your old self in no time. And so will I.

492
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,620
那"世上没有我打不开的瓶子" 那股劲哪去了?
What happened to the "there isn't a jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

493
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,170
等等  你有找到打不开的瓶子? 里头是装什么?
Wait. Did you find a jar you couldn't open? Were pickles in it?

494
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,300
是泡菜吗? 装泡菜的瓶子在哪?
- Where's the giant jar of pickles?! - What my associate is trying to say

495
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,260
我想说这让我联想到
is that we all think the new

496
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,110
我想这个新苏姗 是只喵喵猫
Susan is the "cat's me-wow."

497
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,610
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

498
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,930
谢谢大伙儿 这么说很窝心
Thanks, you guys. That is so sweet,

499
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,100
但我有个正常生活要过 了解吧?
but I have a normal life waiting for me. You know?

500
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,250
明确告诉我
So, tell me,

501
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,940
你要如何以 这巨大身躯去过正常生活?
exactly, how this normal life thing works with you being giant.

502
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,820
我可不会永远都是巨人
I'm not gonna be a giant forever.

503
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:26,590
德瑞克不会放弃 直到找出方法治疗我的..
Derek won't rest until we've found a cure for my...

504
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,620
..病症 我们是团队
...condition. We're a team.

505
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:35,000
我们也帮得上忙 也许有天我们可以认识德瑞克
We could all do with a Derek. Perhaps, someday, we could make his acquaintance!

506
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,520
真的吗? 你们想见见德瑞克?
Really? You guys want to meet Derek?

507
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,390
第一站:莫德斯多
First stop, Modesto!

508
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,140
珍诺蜜卡  我通知你家人 说你快回家了
Ginormica, I called your family to let them know you were coming home.

509
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,290
也通知了莫德斯多警察单位 别对你开枪
Now, I also called the Modesto PD and told them not to shoot at you.

510
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,120
谢谢  将军
Thanks, General.

511
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,810
好的  要记得 人们不习惯看到..任何像..
OK, remember, these people aren't used to seeing... ...anything like...

512
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,340
你  或像你..或像你..
...you, or you... ...or you.

513
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:26,110
所以只要..冷静点 只要..知道吧?跟着我走
So just be, you know, cool. Just be... you know... Follow my lead.

514
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:36,240
停下  那是意外! 别破坏任何东西!
Stop! That was an accident! Don't destroy anything!

515
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,580
苏姗?
Susan?

516
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,590
苏姗? 妈?爹地?
- Susie Q! - Mom? Daddy?

517
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:52,430
他们有在你身上做实验吗? 没有  妈  我很好
- Did they experiment on you? - No, Mom. I'm fine.

518
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,290
没事的 他们跟着我来的
It's OK. They're with me.

519
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,080
他们是我的新朋友
These are my new friends.

520
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,960
哦  德瑞克  我好想念你
Oh, Derek! I missed you so much,

521
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,920
想想  我们重聚首了
thinking that we'd someday be together again!

522
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,800
希望我不会再回到监狱 我爱你  我爱这个男人
It's the only thing that got me through prison! I love you! I love this man!

523
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,320
不  鲍伯 那是我母亲 你会闷死她的
No, B.O.B.! That's my mother! You're suffocating her!

524
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,930
亲爱的  你没事吧?
Honey, are you all right?

525
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,340
我尝到火腿
- I taste ham.

526
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:21,710
抱歉  妈 他只是昏头昏脑的
- Sorry, Mom. He's just a hugger.

527
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,290
德瑞克在哪?
Where's Derek?

528
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,820
他在工作  甜心
He's at work, sweetie.

529
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:30,090
你也知道 他多在乎他的事业
You know how he is about his career.

530
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,490
没有德瑞克 就没必要庆祝了
- We're not gonna celebrate without him!

531
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,330
苏姗  我该拿你的朋友怎么办?
- Susan! What do I do with all your little friends?

532
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,020
请他们吃些小点心 他们什么都吃
Just put out some snacks! They'll eat anything!

533
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,140
哦  真是美味!
Ambrosia!

534
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,730
如何啊?
How's it going?

535
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,110
女朋友不错哦
Qu pasa, girlfriend?

536
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,530
开始狂欢了  虫怪
Way to cut up a rug, Insecto!

537
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,160
谁要跟林克一道游个泳啊?
Who wants to go for a swim with the Link?

538
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,860
嗨  我是 班左.维塔勒金.百卡布内
Hi. I'm Benzoate-Ostylezene-Bicarbonate.

539
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:12,340
你可以叫我鲍伯 这样叫容易些
Or you can call me "B.O.B.", whichever's easier.

540
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,580
我是不是太强硬了? 很抱歉  我有些粗俗
Did I come on too strong? I'm sorry.

541
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,450
我曾在狱中待了大半人生
I'm a little rusty. I've been in prison my whole life.

542
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,140
我为什么提到监狱?
Why'd I mention prison?

543
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,250
哦  我不是要吓你 我马上走开
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just going to go.

544
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,770
啊  我觉得好蠢
I feel so stupid.

545
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:32,180
大家保持镇静 无论如何  不要激怒他们
All right, everyone, just stay calm. Whatever you do, do not provoke them.

546
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,160
大家要来点原子泡沫琴酒吗? 这种酒蛮..
Anyone care for an Atomic Gin Fizz? It's got quite a...

547
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,700
刺激的
...kick.

548
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,870
氯气  氯气 氯气进了我的眼睛
Chlorine! Chlorine in my eyes!

549
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,870
各位,逃生去吧
- They're turning on us!  - Everyone run for your lives!

550
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,180
他们要逃离什么?
What are they running away from?

551
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,680
..真是有趣  吉姆
That's hilarious, Jim.

552
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,869
那正是道地的乡下幽默
That's exactly the kind of down-home country humor

553
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,000
我在福雷兹诺时所会想念的
I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

554

这是德瑞克.狄托 播报的最后一次
This is Derek Dietl, signing off for the very last time.

晚安..莫德斯多 172频道
- Good night, Modesto! - Channel 172.

And cut.

557
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,410
满意我的播报吗? 顺利完成
Did you like that sign off? Just made it up.

558
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,750
哦  我的老天
Oh, my goodness.

559
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,880
慢着  慢着  慢..
Wait, wait, wait! But, but...!

560
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,600
哦  德瑞克 你绝对无法想像 我这三周所发生的事
Oh, Derek. You wouldn't believe my last three weeks!

561
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,390
只有想着你 才能让我保持清醒
Thinking about you was the only thing that kept me sane.

562
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,410
不能呼吸
- Can't breathe! Ribs collapsing!

563
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,780
哦  糟糕  哦  糟糕 真是抱歉
- Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!

564
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,820
哦  天啊  好点了吗?
Oh, my goodness. Is that better?

565
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,950
好的  好的
OK. OK.

566
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,480
我还在适应我新的力道
I'm still kind of getting used to my new strength.

567
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:07,310
哇  你真的很大
Wow! You really are big!

568
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,150
是没错
Yeah,

569
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,400
但我还是我呀 我还是那个你所爱的女孩呀
but I'm still me. I'm still the same girl you fell in love with.

570
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,900
那个..毁坏金门大桥的女孩
Except you did just destroy the Golden Gate Bridge.

571
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,300
呃  那是阻止 巨形机器人的唯一方法
But that was the only way I could stop that giant robot!

572
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,870
你想过我能做像那样的事吗?
You ever think I could do something like that?

573
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,290
不  没有
No, I didn't. I can honestly say it never, ever, ever, ever,

574
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,310
我肯定的说 我从来..没想过那样的事
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever occurred to me.

575
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,060
我知道这有些不可思议
Look, I know this is a little weird.

576
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,110
好吧  是很不可思议 但我们会理出头绪的
OK, it's a lot weird, but we'll figure it out.

577
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:42,240
我们会一起找到方法 让我变回正常人
I know that, together, we can find a way to get me back to normal.

578
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,160
苏姗  请站在我的立场想想
Susan, try and look at this from my perspective.

579
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,020
我的新闻能左右观众
I have an audience that depends on me for news,

580
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,580
气象  运动  窝心的台词
weather, sports and heart-warming fluff pieces.

581
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,940
你却希望我把这些都放一旁
You expect me to put all that on hold

582
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,780
你就为你的遭遇 要毁掉这些?
while you try to undo this thing that happened to you?

583
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,200
那我就该全心全意配合?
That I had absolutely nothing to do with?

584
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,720
是啊 那确实是我所期盼的
Yes. That's exactly what I expect.

585
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,370
那我们所谈论关于未来的事呢? 你还想要吗?
What about the life we always talked about? Don't you still want that?

586
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,850
当然了  只是..
Of course. I just...

587
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,400
难道不明白 我怎么和你继续下去
...don't see how I can have that with you.

588
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:18,440
德瑞克  拜托.. 别这么做
Derek, please, don't do this.

589
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,150
你必须面对事实
You have to face facts, Susan.

590
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,930
别逼我这么说 我现在不打算结婚
Don't crush me for saying this, but I'm not looking to get married

591
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,240
并在别人的阴影下 渡过余生
and spend the rest of my life in someone else's shadow.

592
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,400
而你正投下相当大的阴影
And you're casting a pretty big shadow.

593
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,210
很抱歉 都结束了
I'm sorry. It's over.

594
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,500
祝你好运  苏姗
Good luck, Susan.

595
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,890
哇  多么喧嚣啊
Wow! What a shindig!

596
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,270
你父母的确知道 怎么控制场面
Your parents really know how to throw it down.

597
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,210
很棒的宴会
What? No, that was a great party,

598
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,050
是我出狱后  去过最好的之一
one of the best I've been to since I got out of prison.

599
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,510
我肯定是在不同的宴会
I must have been at a different party,

600
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,440
我倒觉得不怎么样
'cause that's not how I interpreted it at all.

601
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,170
我认为你父母不喜欢我
I don't think your parents liked me,

602
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,950
而且我认为 杰罗给我假的电话号码
and that JELL-O gave me a fake phone number.

603
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,950
至少垃圾是免费的 还有..
Well, at least the garbage was free. You know? I mean...

604
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,210
别自欺欺人了 即便我们拯救了
Ah, who are we kidding?

605
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,730
这星球上的每个城市
We could save every city on the planet,

606
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,360
他们还是会这样看待我们 他们本来就当我们是
and they'd still treat us the same way they've always treated us...

607
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,290
怪兽
...like monsters.

608
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,590
没错  怪兽们
Right. Monsters.

609
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,350
别提了 德瑞克的事呢?
Anyway, how is Derek?

610
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,840
德瑞克是个自私的蠢蛋
Derek is a selfish jerk.

611
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,650
-不是吧 -就是
- No! - Yes.

612
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,680
他许诺的未来
All that talk about "us." "I'm so proud of us."

613
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,030
我所憧憬的未来 只不过是他在福雷兹诺的工作
"Us just got a job in Fresno." There's no "us."

614
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,690
根本没有未来 只有德瑞克他自己
There was only Derek.

615
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,950
为什么我得被殒石击中 才看清事实?
Why did I have to get hit by a meteor to see that?

616
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,160
白痴!
I was such an idiot!

617
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,790
为什么我曾以为 和德瑞克厮守会很棒?
Why did I ever think life with Derek would be so great, anyway?

618
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,740
我是说 看看我所干的那些事
I mean, look at all the stuff I've done without him.

619
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,970
跟外星机器人战斗 那是我  可不是他
Fighting an alien robot? That was me, not him.

620
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:52,180
那太了不起了 遇上你们大伙儿 太了不起了
And that was amazing! Meeting you guys? Amazing.

621
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,210
卡克洛奇博士 你能爬上墙  还能..
Dr. Cockroach, you can crawl up walls

622
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,300
建造超级电脑
and build a supercomputer

623
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,790
只用到 一个披萨盒  二罐发胶  还有..
out of a pizza box, two cans of hairspray, and...

624
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,130
还有文件夹 了不起
- A paper clip! - Amazing!

625
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,630
而你  无须多做介绍 你正是进化的失落环结
And you! You hardly need an introduction. You're the Missing Link!

626
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,640
你曾在可可海滩 掳获250个女学生
You personally carried 250 co-eds off of Cocoa Beach,

627
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,970
仍有余力攻击国家警卫队
and still had strength to fight off the National Guard!

628
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,850
还有海岸警卫队 也有救生员
And the Coast Guard and, also, the lifeguard.

629
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,200
了不起
Amazing!

630
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,600
鲍伯  有谁能够从难以想像的
B.O.B.! Who else could fall

631
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:21,080
高度掉落却毫发无伤
from unimaginable heights and end up without a single scratch?

632
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,900
林克 是你
- Link? - You.

633
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,290
了不起
Amazing!

634
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:31,090
回应的好  虫怪 苏姗  不要欺骗自己
Good point, Insecto! Susan, don't short-change yourself!

635
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:35,180
哦  我不会再欺骗自己 绝对不会
Oh, I'm not going to short-change myself ever again!

636
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,320
苏姗
Susan!

637
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,700
加油!虫怪!
Way to go, Insecto!

638
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,760
虫怪  小心!
Insecto, look out!

639
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,720
虫怪索瑞斯!不..!
Insectosaurus! No!

640
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,770
不会有事的  看着我
You're gonna make it.

641
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,470
别阖上眼睛
It's going to be all right. Look at me.

642
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,410
千万别阖上眼睛
Don't you close those eyes. Don't you dare close those eyes.

643
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,120
不要..
You can't...

644
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,450
你一定很害怕
You must be terrified.

645
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,150
你在奇怪的地方醒来 穿着奇怪的衣服
You wake up in a strange place, wearing strange clothes,

646
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,360
被奇怪的生物囚禁 漂浮在奇怪的盘旋装置
imprisoned by a strange being floating on a strange hovering device.

647
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,400
很奇怪  是吧?
Strange, isn't it?

648
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,340
不会的 这不是第一次
Hardly. It's not the first time.

649
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,010
哇  你还真闲
Wow. You really get around.

650
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,970
你就在萃取室里头
To the extraction chamber!

651
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,830
听着  你想从我身上得到什么?
Look. What is it that you want from me?

652
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,630
你偷走确实属于我的东西
You have stolen what is rightfully mine!

653
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,550
我可没偷你什么东西
I didn't steal anything from you.

654
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,800
你巨怪的躯体 就包含有量子能
Your enormous, grotesque body contains Quantonium,

655
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:55,240
是世上最强力的物质
the most powerful substance in the universe.

656
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,780
你真的以为能占为己有吗?
Did you really think you could keep it from me?

657
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,790
就为了这个?
That's what this is all about?

658
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,620
你毁坏旧金山 使百万居民陷入恐惧
You destroyed San Francisco, you terrified millions of people...

659
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,380
还有杀了我朋友 就只为了得到这个?
...you killed my friend, just to get to me?

660
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:15,260
安静 你的声音在我的耳头嘎嘎作响
Silence! Your voice is grating on my ear nubs.

661
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,750
真可惜  量子能所能 展现的力量不是随处可见
It's a shame you won't be around to see what the power of Quantonium

662
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,000
某个有触角的人知道 该如何使用它
can do in the tentacles of someone who knows how to use it!

663
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,730
我知道该如何使用它
I know how to use it just fine!

664
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:33,860
别自寻烦恼 那力场是无法穿透..
Don't bother. That force field is impenetrab...

665
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,400
搞什么啊?
What the Flagnard?!

666
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,540
哈!那应该可以阻止你弱小..
That should stop your puny...

667
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,250
电脑  关闭第2舱门
Computer, close door, hangar two!

668
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,800
关闭第3舱门
Close door, hangar three!

669
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,090
关闭第4个
Door, hangar four!

670
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:02,050
全部关闭
Close them all!

671
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,440
电脑  开始粹取
Computer, begin extraction!

672
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:37,860
我终于可以在新的星球上 重建我的文明
Finally, I can rebuild my civilization on a new planet.

673
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:41,610
我该在哪里开张呢?
Any thoughts on where I should set up shop?

674
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,510
你的星球  行吧?
Your planet, perhaps?

675
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,180
你黏糊糊的触角 离我的星球远点
You keep your slimy tentacles off my planet!

676
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,980
你若想阻止我 当你有量子能时就该做了
If you wanted to stop me, you should have done it

677
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,060
现在你什么也不是
when you possessed the Quantonium!

678
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,210
下面的人们是无辜的 可没妨害过你呀
Now you're nothing.

679
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,210
在我的星球被摧毁前 那里的人们也是无辜的
There are innocent people down there who didn't do anything!

680
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:03,030
我很遗憾你的星球被摧毁
There were innocent people on my home planet before it was destroyed.

681
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,240
哦  不需要 我就是摧毁它的人 不解?
- I'm sorry your planet was destroyed. - Oh, don't be.

682
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,390
在我对你透露我的故事后
I'm the one who destroyed it. Confused?

683
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:16,340
所有的事都会变得清澈明朗
After I reveal my tale to you, everything will become crystal clear.

684
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,970
电脑..初始化无性繁殖机器
Computer, initialize cloning machine.

685
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,730
是的  嘎勒煞
Yes, Gallaxhar.

686
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,720
在很久以前 当我还只是只小乌贼
Many zentons ago, when I was but a squidling,

687
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,450
我发现到我父母是..
I found out my parents were...

688
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,310
没有孩子能够忍受那个的
No child should ever have to endure that!

689
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,920
所以我坚持己见 并与一只巨..
So I went on the road with a giant...

690
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,410
很快在那之后结婚了
And soon thereafter was married!

691
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,880
本来还过得不错 直到她想要..
Things were going well, until she wanted to...

692
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,540
那时我总回答:"不行"
And then I was all, "No way!",

693
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,020
而她总说:"行的"  于是我..
and she was all, "Yes, way," and I was like...

694
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,940
我想我对你说太多了
But I've told you too much already!

695
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,980
让我新诞生的星球命名为
Let the birth of my new planet, now called...

696
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,280
嘎勒煞星球  开始吧
..."Gallaxhar's Planet" begin!

697
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:36,920
UFO又再度降落美国
Once again, a UFO has landed in America,

698
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:40,360
似乎是UFO唯一想 降落的国家
the only country UFO's ever seem to land in.

699
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,920
抱歉..怎么回事? 好的  好的
Excuse me. What's that, Henshaw? Okey-dokey.

700
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:52,620
现在为您连线到 来自外星太空船的传送
We now take you, live, to a transmission from the alien spacecraft.

701
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,330
地球的人类 我为和平而来
Humans of Earth, I have come in peace.

702
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:03,340
你们不必怕我 对你们无害
You need not fear me. I mean you no harm.

703
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,500
然而  你们最该注意的是
However, it is important to note most of you

704
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,720
接着24小时内  你们将无法存活
will not survive the next 24 hours.

705
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,700
即便有人活下来 也将被奴役或拿来做实验
And those who do survive will be enslaved and experimented on.

706
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,140
你们对此不必有成见 仅是在做生意
You should in no way take any of this personally.

707
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:20,460
再扼要说明:
It's just business. So just to recap:

708
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:25,360
我为和平而来 对你们无害  但你们都得死
I come in peace, I mean you no harm and you all will die. Gallaxhar out.

709
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:32,470
传送完毕
OK, boys, set the terror level

710
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,660
好的  设定恐怖层级为棕色警戒 因为我得去换裤子
at code brown 'cause I need to change my pants.

711
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,390
我们该怎么做  博士?
- What're we gonna do now, Doc? - I...

712
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,970
不知道
I don't know.

713
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:00,540
我来告诉你们该怎么做 我们不该让虫怪白白送死
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're not gonna let Insecto die in vain.

714
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:06,770
我们要上去那里 找到苏姗  并且击败外星人
We're gonna get up there, find Susan, and we're gonna take that alien down!

715
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,540
好了先生们 你们的喷射背包
All right, you got enough juice in

716
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,220
有足够的燃料到达那里
those jetpacks to get up there,

717
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,080
但不够送你们回来
but not enough to make it home.

718
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:20,170
我会尽我所能来接你们 若办不到
I'll come get you if I can. If I don't,

719
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,710
表示我挂了 或来迟了
it means I'm dead. Or late.

720
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,000
我担任你们的监护人 将近50年了
I've been your warden for close to 50 years.

721
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,260
没比这更漫长的任务了
That's no longer the case.

722
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:31,420
但是这值得
For what it's worth...

723
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,830
那真无礼 我们做了什么呢?-不  鲍伯  那不是无礼
- That's rude. What did we do? - No, B.O.B., that's not rude.

724
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,350
 那是表示尊敬的手势
That's a sign of respect.

725
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,550
将军  它正瞄准我们
General, it's targeting us!

726
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,570
就是这主意  中尉 保持这方向
That's the idea, Lieutenant. Hold your course.

727
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,120
全力右转  全力右转 全力右转
Hard right! Hard right!

728
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,960
控制不住 我控制不住
I can't shake it!

729
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,300
坚持到撞击 我们要狂飙一会儿
Hang on to your socks! We're going for a ride!

730
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:26,400
这就是为什么 我总是穿着降落伞  中尉
That's why I always wear a parachute, Lieutenant.

731
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,110
你可以放手了  中尉
You can let go of me now, Lieutenant.

732
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,520
-你这儿向谁打信号? -嘿  肃静
Who are you signaling? We're right here.

733
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,010
嘎勒煞万岁!
- Hail Gallaxhar!

734
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,990
不  不  不是全部 你  那个
- No, not all of you. You, there.

735
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,770
该怎么办? 另三个退后
How do I do this? Three back.

736
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,360
不  不  不  那位  就是你
No, no, no, no. That guy next to you. The one I'm pointing at!

737
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,710
就我指的那个
You! The one...

738
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,460
就是你..卡卡卡.. 就你  生化人  对  很好
You, clone! Yes! Good!

739
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,410
把人犯押解到焚化炉
Take the prisoner to the incinerator.

740
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,050
她对我们没有利用价值了
She's useless to us now.

741
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,810
-嘎勒煞万岁! -我万岁!
- Hail Gallaxhar. - Hail me.

742
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:01,820
珍诺蜜卡不再.. 像原来那样了
Wow. Ginormica ain't so... "ginormic" anymore.

743
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,270
我们该怎么救她呢? 他们人太多了
How are we supposed to get to her? There's too many of them.

744
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,620
办不到的
It's impossible.

745
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:15,710
我或许没脑袋  先生们 但我倒有个主意
I may not have a brain, gentlemen, but I have an idea.

746
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,720
这根本行不通
This is not going to work.

747
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:38,190
站住
Halt!

748
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:48,290
我.. 嘎勒煞命令你 即刻移交人犯
I... Gallaxhar, command you to hand over the prisoner this instant.

749
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,650
无疑地  你是无法 修理的瑕疵品
Clearly, you are defective beyond repair.

750
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:55,040
守卫  把这个瑕疵生化人 带去焚化炉
Guards, take this defective clone to the incinerator!

751
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,550
你们还在等什么? 你  还有你!
Well, what are you waiting for? You and you!

752
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,550
什么?真的?
Seriously?

753
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:08,850
是的  把人犯与瑕疵生化人带去焚化炉
Yes! Take the prisoner and the defective clone to the incinerator!

754
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:13,600
啊  当然  长官 这是安全通关卡 以备不需
- Of course, sir. - Here's a security pass, just in case.

755
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:17,320
-需要枝枪吗? -是的  需要
- Would you like a gun? - Yes, I would.

756
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,990
嘿  大伙儿  看呀
Hey, guys, look.

757
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:28,940
真不敢相信你们来救我 谢谢你们
I can't believe you guys came to save me. Thank you.

758
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,460
用不着客气 我们怪兽该相互依存
Don't mention it. We monsters got to stick together.

759
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:36,360
但我不再是怪兽了 我只是..我
But I'm not a monster anymore. I'm just me.

760
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:40,510
亲爱的  这无关你的尺寸 你永远..
My dear, no matter what your size, you'll always be...

761
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,510
什么也不是 只是个肮脏的碳基生命体
...nothing but a filthy, carbon-based life form!

762
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,470
嘎勒煞万岁!
Hail Gallaxhar!

763
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,180
嘎勒煞万岁!
Hail Gallaxhar.

764
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,480
这些伪装还真有效!
These disguises are the bomb!

765
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,230
就是了  跟我来
That's it! Follow me.

766
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,260
-有个方法能够拯救.. -嘎勒煞万岁!
- The only way to save the Earth... - Hail Gallaxhar!

767
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,720
嘎勒煞万岁!
Hail Gallaxhar. The only way...

768
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,430
-有个方法能够拯.. -嘎勒煞万岁!
- Hail Gallaxhar! - Hail Gallaxhar.

769
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,100
有个方法能够拯救地球 就是在入侵之前炸毁它
...to save the Earth is to blow up this ship...

770
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,310
嘎勒煞万岁!
- Hail Gallaxhar! - Hail Gallaxhar.

771
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,960
嘎勒煞万岁! 在入侵展开之前
- ...before the invasion starts.

772
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:11,400
-那么我们该怎么做?
- How are we gonna do this?

773
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,210
-我们得找到主动力核心
We need to find the main power core.

774
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,440
抱歉  你能指引 主动力核心在哪吗?
Excuse me, could you direct us to the main power core?

775
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:20,710
很乐意  就在那里 萃取室的上面
Gladly. It's right there, above the extraction chamber.

776
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,630
非常感谢 嘎勒煞万岁!
Thank you very much. Hail Gallaxhar.

777
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,350
-小心 -喔  当心点  笨蛋
- Watch out! - Look out, brainless!

778
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,710
给我那玩意儿
Give me that thing!

779
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,400
像这种武器 应该由负责任的人拿着
A weapon like this needs to be in the hands of someone responsible.

780
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,820
怎么?
What?!

781
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,030
嘎勒煞万岁?
Hail Gallaxhar?

782
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,980
-怪兽
Monsters!

783
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,790
-怪兽 怪兽?
- Monsters. - Monsters?!

784
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:59,210
注意! 所有外星人摧毁所有怪兽
Attention, all aliens! Destroy all monsters!

785
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,510
要试试这个吗?
You want some of this?!

786
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,970
你要伤害我朋友 就得过我这关
You want to hurt my friends, you'll have to go through me!

787
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,770
哦  对
Oh, yeah.

788
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,220
我们好像办到了
I can't believe we made it!

789
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:11,970
-天啊  -警告  发现侵入者
-O... M... G.  -Warning: Intruder

790
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,580
你绝无法破解 我的色彩密码
You'll never figure out my color code.

791
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:23,280
六音步的色彩密码系统 难以破解  但只消一会儿
A hexadecimal color code system. This won't be but a moment.

792
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,530
红  绿  蓝  黄  橘 宝贝蓝

purple, pink, mauve, gold, brown, mocha, avocado, adobe gold!

794
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,520
博士  加油!跳吧!
Doc, come on, dance!

795
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:44,630
你失败累人的舞步 比不上我的安全设定
Your busted, tired dance moves are no match for my security protocols.

796
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,860
我们无法阻止他们太久
- We can't hold them off much longer!

797
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:49,280
有件事你并不知道  亲爱的
- One thing you don't know about me!

798
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:52,870
我的..博士学位..研究的是..
My Ph.D... is in...

799
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:56,540
跳舞
...dance! Dance! Dance!

800
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:59,540
安全设定被破解
Security protocol breached.

801
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,980
本舰已被设定为自毁

802
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:07,920
在T减6分钟后  全部摧毁
Total annihilation in T-minus six minutes.

803
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,380
-什么?马上发动入侵 -不再有能力入侵
- Well, launch the invasion then! - Invasion no longer possible.

804
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,930
电脑  将量子能导入舰桥
Oh, space balls! Divert the Quantonium to the bridge,

805
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:19,380
并准备好逃生舱
and prepare my escape capsule!

806
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,370
看哪!他们都吓跑了 怪兽赢了
Look at that! They're all running scared! Monsters win!

807
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:39,900
我不认为他们吓跑了
I don't think that's why they're running.

808
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:44,670
本舰将在T减5分钟后自毁
Ship will self-destruct in T-minus five minutes.

809
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,090
嘎勒煞万岁!
Hail Gallaxhar!

810
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,340
我们办不到
We're not gonna make it!

811
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:00,100
撑住
Hang on!

812
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,840
坚持住
Keep going!

813
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,640
没用的  难以撼动
It's no use. It won't budge.

814
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,360
我要还是珍诺蜜卡 就办得到了
If I was still Ginormica, I could do this!

815
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,730
苏姗  趁还有机会 快逃离这里吧
Get out of here while you still got the chance!

816
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,570
不  别这么说 我不会丢下你们的
No! Don't say that. I'm not leaving you guys.

817
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,990
你要的  找到蒙格
Yes, you are. Rendezvous with Monger.

818
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,220
他就在舰外面等你 去吧  趁还来得及
He's outside the ship, waiting for you. Go while there's still time.

819
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:41,160
本舰将在T减4分钟后自毁
Ship will self-destruct in T-minus four minutes.

820
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,920
别担心我们  苏姗
Don't you worry about us, Susan.

821
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,850
你终于有机会恢复原来的生活
You finally have a chance to get your old life back.

822
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,610
我不要我原来的生活
I don't want my old life back.

823
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,470
他们以为能阻止我?
They think they've stopped me?!

824
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,810
他们阻止不了
They've stopped nothing.

825
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:05,150
雌性碳基生命体 或称苏姗  不包含在内
Female carbon-based life form, or Susan, not contained.

826
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,670
什么?
What?!

827
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,720
探测机器人注意 攻击那个地球生物
Attention, robot probes! Crush the earthling!

828
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,000
机器人舱房已毁
Robot bay has been destroyed.

829
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,960
发射费佐伊火炮
Fire phasoid cannon!

830
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,550
你疯了吗? 你可能会杀了我!
Are you crazy?! You could have killed me!

831
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,820
那么我们彼此认识
Then we understand each other.

832
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:23,100
现在  打开门 放了我的朋友
Now, open the doors and let my friends go.

833
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:24,430
要不然呢?
Or what?

834
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,370
你该不会真的以为 你是我的对手吧?
You don't actually think you're a match for me, do you?

835
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:34,740
量子能已经成功导入舰桥
Quantonium has been successfully diverted to the bridge.

836
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:38,170
逃生舱  准备进行传送
Escape capsule ready for transport.

837
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:43,470
就像我之前所说 你该在拥有量子能时打败我
Like I told you before, you should have defeated me when you had the Quantonium

838
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,680
享受爆炸的乐趣
Have fun exploding!

839
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:16,650
现在  把门打开 即使我想  也办不到
- Now open the doors. - Even if I wanted to, I couldn't!

840
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,870
当你设定船舰自毁 就是这种情况了
That's what happens when you set a ship to self-destruct!

841
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,080
我们都死定了
Now we're all going to die!

842
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,850
而你无能为力 苏姗..
And there's nothing you can do about it, Susan!

843
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,730
我可不这么认为
I wouldn't be so sure.

844
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,440
还有  我叫珍诺蜜卡
And the name is Ginormica.

845
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:49,600
T减1分钟后毁灭
