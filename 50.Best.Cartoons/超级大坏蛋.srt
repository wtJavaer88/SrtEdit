2
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,800
至今我的生活是这样的:
Here's my day so far:

3
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,640
蹲过大牢 失去过梦中情人
Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams,

4
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,110
被狠狠扁过
and got my butt kicked pretty good.

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,810
仍然 事情变得更加糟糕
Still, things could be a lot worse.

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,550
噢 对了
Oh, that's right.

7
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,950
我就要摔成肉饼了
I'm falling to my death.

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,990
不是吧
Guess they can't.

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,420
你也许会问 怎会如此结局? 
How'd it all come to this, you ask?

10
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,490
结局早已是注定的
My end starts at the beginning.

11
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,660
从最初就注定了
The very beginning.

12
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,200
是的 那就是我
Yes, that's me.

13
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,670
我有一个非常正常的童年
I had a fairly standard childhood.

14
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,680
我出生于 你们所说的破碎的家庭
I came from, what you might call, a broken home.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,600
字面意义上的破碎
Literally broken.

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,150
我在八天大的时候 我还和我的双亲在一起
I was eight days old and still living with my parents.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,510
很悲剧吧
How sad is that?

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,780
显然这个时候该改变了
Clearly it was time to move on.

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,720
这是你的跟班 他会照顾你的
Here is your minion. He will take care of you.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,320
还有 这个是你的奶嘴
And here is your binky.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,260
你的命运是...
You are destined for...

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,660
我没有听清楚最后的那一部分 不过听起来很重要
I didn't quite hear that last part, but it sounded important.

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,460
...二 一 - 命运是啥? 
...two, one. - Destined for what?

24
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,970
我出发去寻找我的人生
I set out to find my destiny.

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,840
另一个格兰普象限的小鬼与我的想法完全一致
Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,250
就是那天我遇到了大好人先生...
That was the day I met Mr. Goody Two- Shoes...

27
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,630
...那时我们闪亮的人生轨迹开始了
...and our glorious rivalry was born.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,570
难道这个就是我命运? 
Could this be what I was destined for?

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,200
奢华的梦幻般的生活
A dream life filled with luxury.

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,510
显然不是的
Apparently not.

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,950
就连命运也会按喜好挑选
Even fate picks its favorites.

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,580
没啥
No big deal.

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,410
一个截然不同的人生等着我
A much different fate awaited me.

34
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,830
宝宝 真体贴
A baby! How thoughtful.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,760
噢 是的 是的 我看到了它就想到了你
Oh, yes. Yes, I saw it and thought of you.

36
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,700
幸运的是 我找到了一个小小的一个叫家的地方
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,030
我们能留下它么
Can we keep it?

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,770
这个地方教育我对和错
A place that taught me the differences between right...

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,270
的区别
...and wrong.

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,770
大好人先生
Mr. Goody Two- Shoes, on the other hand,

41
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,440
过着衣来伸手饭来张口的日子
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,080
我们的宝宝会飞呀
Our baby can fly.

43
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,480
是的 是的 你的宝宝最强了 亲爱的
Yes, yes, nothing but the best for you, darling.

44
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,920
飞行能力 刀枪不入 无敌发型
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.

45
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,260
我又更加更加强的本领
But I had something far, far greater.

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,730
强大的智慧......
My amazing intellect...

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,420
...我有能制造破坏力超强的工具
...and knack for building objects of mayhem.

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,210
在几年的良好表现后
After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior,

49
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,240
我有机会能继续深造了...
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning...

50
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,640
...通过一个叫学校的奇怪地方
...at a strange place called shool.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,410
在那里我再次遇到了大好人先生
It was there that I once again ran into Mr. Goody Two- Shoes.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,420
在那里他已经有了他的脑残粉丝团了
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies.

53
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,890
他用美味食物
He bought their affections with showmanship

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,400
收买友情
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,400
所以我也要做爆米花 然后赢得这群盲目份子的喜爱
So I, too, will make this popp- ed corn and win over those mindless drones.

56
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,940
熄灯
Lights out.

57
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,030
从那时我学到了艰辛的一课:
That's when I learned a very hard lesson:

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,860
好人总是受到爱戴
Good receives all the praise and adulation,

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,900
干坏事的就是要去蹲墙角
while evil is sent to quiet- time in the corner.

60
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,340
看来我无法合群
So fitting in wasn't really an option.

61
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,780
当他们在学唱儿歌时...
While they were learning the Itsy Bitsy Spider...

62
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,950
...我在学习如何将生物脱水然后再按照意愿水化它们
...I learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will.

63
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,920
有些时候 觉得只有小跟班和我在一起 与全世界为敌
Some days, it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world.

64
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,050
不管我怎么努力
No matter how hard I tried,

65
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,290
我永远都不合群
I was always the odd man out,

66
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,230
是剩下的那个
the last one picked,

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,490
永远一团糟 是老鼠屎
the screw- up, the black sheep...

68
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,030
瞄准他! 
Get him!

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,470
...坏孩子 - 怪胎! 
...the bad boy. - Freak!

70
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,570
傻逼! 
Weirdo!

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,110
这就是我的命运吗? 
Was this my destiny?

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,010
等等 也许没错
Wait, maybe it was.

73
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,990
当坏蛋不就是我最拿手的吗
Being bad is the one thing I'm good at.

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,260
我恍然大悟 如果我是个坏孩子
Then it hit me: If I was the bad boy,

75
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,420
我就要当最坏的那个
then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.

76
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,760
我命中注定会成为超级大坏蛋
I was destined to be a super- villain,

77
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,570
我们生来就是对手
and we were destined to be rivals.

78
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,670
生死已注定
The die had been cast,

79
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,040
我那不朽史诗般的终身事业就这样开始了
and so began an enduring, epic, lifelong career.

80
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,240
我爱这份工作
And I loved it.

81
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,550
我们的恩怨越来越错综复杂
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

82
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,720
他赢了几次
He would win some.

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,360
我也不逊色
I would almost win others.

84
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,830
他的名号是曼城卫士 蛮城的守护者
He took the name Metro Man, defender of Metrocity.

85
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,620
我打算取一个低调点的名字 超级大坏蛋
I decided to pick something a little more humble: Megamind...

86
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,570
不可比拟的英俊的犯罪天才 一切罪恶的主人
...incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy.

87
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:21,570
超级大坏蛋

88
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,180
下班了再看 开门
Read on your own time. Open up.

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,630
- 嘿 - 呸
- Hey! - Boo!

90
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,960
噢 早上好 典狱官
Oh, good morning, Warden.

91
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,070
好消息哦 我改过自新了
Great news: I'm a changed man, and...

92
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,970
作为合格的公民 我可以重返社会了
...and I'm ready to re- enter society as a solid citizen.

93
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,540
你是个恶棍 而且永远是个恶棍
You're a villain, and you'll always be a villain.

94
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,370
你根本没有改过 也就别想着离开
You'll never change, and you'll never leave.

95
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,840
你真搞笑
You're fun.

96
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,280
有人给你寄了份礼物
You got a present in the mail.

97
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,810
是狗狗吗
Is it a puppy?

98
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,150
曼城卫士给你的 "希望你珍惜85次无期徒刑的每分每秒"
From Metro Man. "To count every second of your 85 life sentences."

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,590
真好玩 没想到曼城卫士也会幸灾乐祸
That's funny. Never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.

100
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,460
噢 但他品位的确不错 我帮你保管吧
Oh, but he does have nice taste. I think I'll keep it.

101
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,760
能不能不要拖延我的时间了
Any chance you could give me the time?

102
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,870
今天曼城卫士博物馆开放 我不想迟到
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man Museum.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,570
噢 不 看来你要错过了
Oh no. Looks like you're gonna miss it,

104
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,640
错过好几千年
by several thousand years.

105
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,170
噢 是吗
Oh, am I?

106
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,210
曼城 曼城卫士日快乐
Happy Metro Man Day, Metro City.

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,250
在这美丽的日子 美丽的城市
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown,

108
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,520
我们有幸向这个美丽的人致敬 曼城卫士
where we're here to honor a beautiful man, Metro Man.

109
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,260
他的心胸似海洋 但更宽广
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.

110
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,730
这些年 他用他的超视力一直看护着我们
For years he's been watching us with his super- vision,

111
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,430
用他的超能力解救我们 用他那超宽广的爱心照顾我们
saving us with his super- strength and caring for us with his super- heart.

112
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,400
现在我们回报他的时候到了
Now it's our turn to give something back.

113
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,510
这里是洛克斯安 瑞驰
This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting live

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,110
在 曼城卫士博物馆落成典礼现场发回的报道
from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,910
喔 好的 刚才他们让你在广播里念的那一段
Wow. OK, the stuff they make you read on- air,

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,350
真难以置信 都疯狂了
that's un- freaking- believable. It's crazy.

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,750
那是我自己写的 哈尔
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,320
其实我想说的是
What I was trying to say was,

119
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,190
在现代社会里
I can't believe that in our modern society,

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,850
还能出现艺术的美感真是难得啊
they let, like, actual art get onto the news.

121
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,330
补救的不错啊 哈尔
- Nice save, Hal. - What are we...

122
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,590
我们去喝杯咖啡什么的吧
Like, let's just get a coffee or something.

123
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,430
拜托 今天是 曼城卫士节的大日子
Come on, it's time to get in the Metro Man Day spirit.

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
如果我是曼城卫士的话
Well, if I were Metro Man,

125
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,000
决不会让超级大坏蛋 绑架你那么多次
Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

126
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,510
- 这是最最最重要的事 - 你真贴心 哈尔
- That's the first thing. - That's sweet, Hal.

127
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,970
我会像澳洲野犬照顾孩子一样看着你
And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby.

128
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,410
好吧 那听起来...
OK, that sounded...

129
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,840
- 好吧 那听起来有点怪 - 是的 确实有一点
- OK, that sounded a little weird. - A little bit. Yeah.

130
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,210
你的鬼脸让我也感到怪怪的
And you're making a weird face, and that's making me feel weird.

131
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,780
重点是 我会看着你就像...
The point is, I would watch you like someone...

132
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,250
不是爱 我们又没恋爱 我不是说我爱你
Not love. We're not in love. I'm not saying I love you.

133
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,650
嘿 不管怎么样 我爱你
Hey, I love you. Whatever.

134
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,760
但是 我又没有说就像我爱着你 我是说...
But I'm not saying like I'm in love with you. I'm saying...

135
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,890
洛克斯安 洛克斯安
Roxanne? Roxaroo?

136
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,970
- 什么...什么 - 嘿...
- Whoa... What? - Hey...

137
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,140
好好上班 政府花钱又不是让你游手好闲的
Get back to work. The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

138
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,310
- 不许动! - 同志们 你们要干什么
- Freeze! - Whoa. What are you doing, guys?

139
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,280
是我 我是典狱官
It's me! It's the warden.

140
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,450
喂 开门
Hey! Open up!

141
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,160
不 你们这些笨蛋 我们被他耍了
No, you fools. He's tricked us.

142
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,760
你说得没错
You were right.

143
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,160
我一直都会是个大坏蛋
I'll always be a villain.

144
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,620
哎呀帅哥 要搭你一程不
Well, hello good- Iooking. Need a lift?

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,150
当然要啊 你这条聪明绝顶的鱼
Certainly do, you fantastic fish, you.

146
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,820
- 快上车吧 - 我自由了
- Get in the car, you. - I'm free!

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,430
是吗
Right?

148
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,560
你送我的手表太赞了 小跟班
Nice work sending me the watch, Minion.

149
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,100
- 那还用说 老板 - 用力打
- You got it, boss. - Punch it!

150
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,740
成功 大家一起来举起双手
All right, put your hands in the air.

151
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,280
女士们先生们 欢迎曼城卫士
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man!

152
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,650
- 你们在等谁 - 曼城卫士! 
- Who's your man? - Metro Man!

153
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,380
是的 曼城! 
Yeah, Metro City!

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,650
来吧 举高你们的手
Gimme some. Come on. Give it now.

155
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,690
把手都给我 来吧 很好
Give it to me. Right on. Gimme the good stuff. All right.

156
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,270
嘿 曼城
Hey, Metro City.

157
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,670
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

158
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,110
你们都知道 你们都知道 我是很低调的
You know, you know, I just want to bring it down a bit.

159
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,380
小伙子们 小点声 谢谢你们 朋友们
Boys, a little lower. Thank you, fellas.

160
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,790
现在来点实际的
Let's get real for a moment.

161
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,220
对的 对的 对的
That's right. That's right. That's right.

162
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,920
尽管有了博物馆是非常非常酷的事情
Although getting a whole museum is super- cool, is super- cool,

163
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,330
但你们知道我最大荣誉是什么吗
you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?

164
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,230
你们真的想知道吗 真的吗
Do you really want to know? Really?

165
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,870
那我来告诉你们
I'll tell you.

166
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,450
你们给我的最大荣誉就是...
The greatest honor you've given me is letting me serve you,

167
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,170
...让我为你们服务 帮助曼城的市民
the helpless people of Metro City.

168
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,080
每天结束的时候
And at the end of every day,

169
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,310
我常常问自己
well, I often ask myself...

170
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,880
如果没有你们 我会是谁? 
...who would I be without you?

171
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,990
- 我爱你 曼城卫士! - 我也爱你们 市民朋友
- I love you, Metro Man! - And I love you, random citizen.

172
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,100
我跟你说 小跟班 没什么能比得上自己的邪恶老窝了
I tell you, Minion. There's no place like evil lair.

173
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,370
我特地为您保持潮湿阴冷
I've kept it cold and damp just for you, sir.

174
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,140
我看起来怎样 小根班? 我看起来很邪恶不? 
How do I look, Minion? Do I look bad?

175
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,180
先生 您恐怖得一塌糊涂
Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

176
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,870
你的小嘴儿越来越甜了
You always know what to say.

177
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,180
噢 我的脑蝇 当然想你们啦
Oh, the brain- bots certainly missed you, sir.

178
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,820
想你们的老爹不 那个最调皮的捣蛋鬼呢
Did you miss your daddy? Who's a menacing little cyborg?

179
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,220
是你啊 是的 就是你 不许咬
You are. Yes, you are. No biting.

180
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,350
不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

181
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,620
要扳手吗? 去捡回来吧
You want the wrench? Go get the wrench.

182
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,700
- 噢 快看 - 现在欢笑又回来了
- Oh, look at that. - Now, back to laughing.

183
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,140
她快醒了 快准备干活
She's awake. Quick, to work.

184
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,080
瑞驰小姐 我们又见面了
Miss Ritchi, we meet again.

185
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,090
把袋子洗了你会死啊
Would it kill you to wash the bag?

186
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,350
瑞驰小姐你就扯起嗓子喊吧
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.

187
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,620
你喊破喉咙也不会有人听见的
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

188
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,260
为...为什么你不叫啊
Wh... Why isn't she screaming?

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,060
瑞驰小姐 如果你不介意的话
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind?

190
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,760
就像这样...
Like this...

191
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,670
但是 那是 可怜女士的叫法
But that's, that's a poor lady scream.

192
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,270
他比我擅长些
He's a little better.

193
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,110
这个是不是在那个傻叉超级恶棍网站上
Is there some kind of nerdy super- villain Web site

194
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,110
搞到的特斯拉线圈和闪光按键
where you get Tesla coils and blinky dials?

195
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,840
事实上 大部分都是从...
Actually, most of it comes from an outlet store in...

196
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,320
不要接话
Don't answer that.

197
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,450
- 罗马尼亚买的 - 不要 停
- Romania. - Don't! Stop!

198
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,850
她在用她那记者的小伎俩
She's using her nosy reporter skills

199
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,460
从你不设防的脑袋里 挖掘我们的秘密
on your weak- willed mind to find out all our secrets.

200
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,530
这点小伎俩对我没用
Such tricks won't work on me...

201
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,360
- 能再说慢点吗 - 妖精
- Please talk slower. ...temptress.

202
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,630
你有什么秘密 一眼就看穿了
What secrets? You're so predictable.

203
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,800
看穿了 看穿了
Predictable? Predictable?

204
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,570
噢 你叫这个看穿了
Oh, you call this predictable?

205
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,480
你的短吻鳄嘛 是的
Your alligators. Yes.

206
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,340
耶 在来的路上我就想到了
Yeah, I was thinking about it on the way over.

207
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,890
那这个呢 砰 在你脸上
What's this? Boom! In your face.

208
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,080
- 陈词滥调 - 不 看这个
- Cliche. - No! Look, watch.

209
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,150
- 幼稚 - 震撼吧
- Juvenile. - Shock and awe.

210
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,730
- 没新意 - 噢 这多可怕啊
- Tacky. - Oh, it's so scary!

211
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,520
- 见过了 - 那这个呢
- Seen it. - What's this one do?

212
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,490
浮夸
Garish.

213
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,660
- 好吧 蜘蛛还有点新意 - 蜘蛛? 
- OK, the spider's new. - Spider?

214
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,980
是的 蜘蛛
Yes. The... The spee- ider.

215
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,480
即使被这只致命黑寡妇咬一小口
Even the smallest bite from Arachnis deathicus

216
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,140
就会彻底瘫掉...
will instantly paralyze...

217
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,350
帮我赶走 它在咬我
Get it off! It bit me!

218
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,780
放弃吧 超级大坏蛋 你的计划就没成功过
Give it up, Megamind. Your plans never work.

219
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,710
别浪费时间了 赶紧给男朋友打电话吧
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?

220
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,200
很荣幸的能把这个新博物馆献给给曼城卫士
It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man his new museum.

221
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,700
有请
If you please.

222
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,700
- 曼城卫士! - 嘿 我孩子看不见
- Metro Man! - Hey! My kid can't see.

223
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,330
- 超级大坏蛋 - 噢 好极了 曼城卫士
- Megamind! - Oh, bravo, Metro Man.

224
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,070
呸! 
Boo!

225
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,080
没错 我一起玩 呸
Yes, I can play along too. Boo!

226
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,340
我早知道你会来闹场子
Should've known you'd try to crash the party.

227
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,680
噢 不仅仅是闹场子这么简单
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

228
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,410
今天会让你和蛮城都会很难忘
This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget.

229
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,610
是读作曼城! 
It's pronounced Metro City!

230
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,660
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
Potato- tomato, potato- tomato.

231
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,190
我们都知道结局会怎么样 那就是你再次入狱
We all know how this ends: With you behind bars.

232
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,960
正在我的海豹皮靴里发抖呢
I'm shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots.

233
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,700
你就要永别蛮城了 不然的话这是你最后一次
You will leave Metrocity, or this will be the last

234
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,600
听到洛克斯安 瑞驰讲话了
you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi.

235
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,070
洛克斯安 不要慌 洛丝 
Roxanne! Don't panic, Roxie.

236
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,080
- 我马上就到 - 是的 我不慌张
- I'm on my way. - Yeah, I'm not panicking.

237
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,310
要想阻止我 你先找到我吧 曼城卫士
In order to stop me, you need to find me first, Metro Man.

238
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,970
我们在废弃的t望台
We're at the abandoned observatory.

239
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,180
不 不是的
No, we're not!

240
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,380
不要听她的 她疯掉了
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.

241
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,680
曼城卫士就要到了 先生
Metro Man approaching, sir.

242
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,890
等等
Hold on a second.

243
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,930
噢 我的天
Oh, good heavens!

244
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,010
你没想到我们是在真的t望台吧
You didn't think you were in the real observatory, did you?

245
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,180
准备发射死亡射线 小跟班
Ready the death ray, Minion.

246
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,150
死亡射线 准备发射
Death ray, readying.

247
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,550
看这里 我的老朋友
Over here, old friend.

248
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,220
友情提醒下 你掉进我的陷阱啦
In case you haven't noticed, you've fallen right into my trap.

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,370
你无法打败正义 这是一种理想 一种信念
You can't trap justice. It's an idea, a belief.

250
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,730
就算最虔诚的信念也会被时间所侵蚀
Even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time.

251
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,370
正义是耐腐蚀的金属
Justice is a non- corrosive metal.

252
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,030
但是 金属能被复仇的火焰融化
But metals can be melted by the heat of revange.

253
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,110
是仇恨 最好冷冻起来
It's "revenge," and it's best served cold.

254
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,080
但能用微波炉方便的进行加热
But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil.

255
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,240
我想保修期快到了吧
Well, I think your warranty is about to expire.

256
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,580
或许我能延长保修期
Maybe I got an extended warranty.

257
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,380
不正确使用该产品保修是无效的
Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for its intended purpose.

258
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,650
噢 姑娘们 姑娘们 你们都很漂亮 我能回家了不
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?

259
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,230
当然可以了 如果曼城卫士抗住
Of course. That is, if Metro Man can withstand the full,

260
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,890
太阳的聚光
concentrated power of the sun!

261
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,200
发射
Fire!

262
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,600
小跟班 发射
Minion. Fire?

263
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,250
- 先生 还在预热中 - 你说什么? 
- It's still warming up, sir. - Come again?

264
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,780
- 预热中 先生 - 预热中 太阳还要预热
- Warming up, sir. - Warming up? The sun is warming up?

265
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,080
就一下下...
One second more and...

266
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,090
...就一下下 一下下 一下下 下下 下...
...just tippy- tappy tippy- tap- tap, tip- top more,

267
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,460
- 我们马上就准备... - 说实话
- and we are ready in just... - Honestly!

268
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,790
我就来了 洛丝
On my way, Roxie.

269
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,060
都跟你说了 要准备好 都说了无数次了
I told you to have things ready. I told you countless times.

270
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,100
为嘛老是怪我
Why do you always blame me?

271
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,100
蜘蛛毒让我开始抽风
My spider bite is acting up.

272
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,540
你的计划又打了水漂了 承认吧
Your plan is failing. Just admit it.

273
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,110
是啊 希望下次能行
Yeah, good luck with that one.

274
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,640
你站哪边
Whose side are you on?

275
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,640
- 输的一边 - 谢谢
- The losing side. - Thank you.

276
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,540
能给我的绑架贵宾卡上多积一分吗
Could someone stamp my Frequent Kidnapping Card?

277
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,850
这个活动早就到期了
You of all people know we discontinued that promotion.

278
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,960
- 各位 再见了 - 下周老时间见吗
- Ciao- ciao, all! - Same time next week?

279
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,020
见鬼! 金刚罩! 
Dag! Crab nuggets!

280
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,790
- 他在讲啥 - 金刚罩
- What did he just say? - "Crab nuggets"?

281
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,220
天啊 我飞不出去
Fackled fish cracker!

282
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,390
还剩十秒
Ten seconds to full power.

283
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,870
- 天呐 我困住了 - 十...
- Good lord, I'm trapped. - Ten...

284
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,870
- 他又搞什么东东 - 九...
- what kind of trickery is this? ...nine...

285
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,740
- 你这个疯子 ...八...
- You mad genius. ...eight...

286
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,640
- 你终于得逞了 ...七...
- Your dark gift has finally paid off. ...seven...

287
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,470
- 有吗? ...六...
- It... It has? ...six...

288
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,410
这个穹顶镀了铜
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

289
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,880
- 是的 怎样 - 先生...
- Yeah? So? - Sir...

290
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,420
- 铜耗尽了我的能量 ...二...
- Copper drains my powers. ...two...

291
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,990
- 你的弱点居然是铜 ...一...
- Your weakness is copper? ...one.

292
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,590
- 开玩笑吧 - 充满
- You're kidding, right? - Full power.

293
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,180
我觉得他这次死翘翘了
I don't think even he could survive that.

294
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,350
还是不抱希望吧
Well, let's not get our hopes up just yet.

295
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,020
- 快快看 - 曼城卫士! 
- Look! - Metro Man!

296
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,060
曼城卫士
Metro Man.

297
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,630
曼城卫士! 
Metro Man!

298
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,880
- 你做到了 先生 - 我做到了吗
- You... You did it, sir. - I did it?

299
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,950
他做到了
He did it.

300
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,250
- 我做到了 - 他做到了
- I did it? - He did it.

301
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,760
- 你做到了 先生 - 我做到了
- You did it, sir. - I did it!

302
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,920
- 你做到了 - 我做到了 蛮城是我的啦
- You did it! - I did it! Metrocity is mine!

303
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,970
- 你做到了 先生 - 我做到了 是的 我 我
- You did it, sir! - I did it! Yeah, me, me!

304
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,500
- 是的 我做到了 - 我们 我们一起做到了
- Yes, I did it! - Us! We both did it!

305
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,470
- 不是我们 是我 - 你 比我做的
- Not us! I! - You, a little more

306
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,370
- 多那么一点 - 比你多的多
- than me but still, come on! - A lot more than you.

307
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,840
他们什么时候颁奖
When they're giving out the awards,

308
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,450
- 我跟在你后面 - 什么奖 什么奖 为啥颁奖
- I'm gonna be right there next to you. - What awards? What awards, for what?

309
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,510
放音乐
Hit it!

310
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,200
放下武器
Drop 'em!

311
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,710
首先 真是惊天大逆转啊
First off, what a turnout.

312
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,870
很疯狂吧
How wild is this?

313
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,640
我所做的就是铲除了全宇宙最强悍的人
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.

314
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,550
还有什么问题吗 是的 后面那位
Are there any questions? Go on. Yes! You in the back.

315
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,680
我肯定大家都想知道 你会怎么处置我们和这座城市
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city.

316
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,500
很好 真高兴你问这个问题
Good, I'm glad you asked that.

317
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,160
想想下你们能想到的最恐怖
Imagine the most horrible, terrifying,

318
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,300
最邪恶的事情
evil thing you can possibly think of,

319
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,340
然后再乘以...六
and multiply it... by six!

320
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
同时
In the meantime,

321
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,380
你们可以继续过你们无聊的
I want you to carry on with the dreary, normal things

322
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,070
柴米油盐酱醋茶的生活
you normal people do.

323
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,380
享受这样的生活吧
Let's just have fun with this. Come on.

324
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,020
我会回来的
And I will get back to you.

325
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,930
现在 狠狠地甩门
Now slam the door really hard.

326
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,120
他们...还是能看到你啊
They... They can still see you.

327
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,630
- 现在呢 - 是的 还是能看到啊
- Now? - Your elbow's still in.

328
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,170
很好
Good.

329
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,140
他来了 邪恶之王
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord

330
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,870
噢 小跟班 你有想过今天吗
Oh, Minion, did you think this day would ever come?

331
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,210
没有 完全没 先生
No way. Not at all, sir.

332
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,370
从没 过个万把年也没... 我的意思是
Never. Never in a million... I mean...

333
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,580
- 是的 我想过 - 看看这精美的吊顶
- Yes, I did. - Look at the intricate mouldings.

334
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,620
在看呢 在看呢
I'm looking. I'm looking.

335
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,550
这是啥
And what's this?

336
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,750
看上去像基地里的大监视器
It's like one of the giant monitors in the lair.

337
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
但好像只有一个画面啊
But it seems to only carry one station.

338
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,000
哦 那啊 主人 那个叫做窗户
Oh, that, sir, is called a window.

339
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,640
- 窗户... - 所有孩子从这里往外看
- Window? - All the kids are looking through them.

340
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,500
哦 我以前从没看到过风景
I've never had a view before.

341
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,970
蛮城 小跟班 这都是我的了
Metrocity, Minion, it's all mine.

342
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,480
如果我的父母现在能看到我的话
If my parents could see me now.

343
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,680
先生 我肯定他们在坏蛋的天平向您微笑
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.

344
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,250
现在大好人先生被铲除了
And now that Mr. Goody Two- Shoes is out of the way,

345
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,950
我有了我想要的一切了
I can have everything I want,

346
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,460
而且没人能阻止我了
and there's no one to stop me!

347
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,370
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

348
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,310
一直饥渴 永远都得不到满足
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

349
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,480
我能理解 漂亮的小小小小鸟
I understand you, little well- dressed bird.

350
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,920
无目标 空虚啊 都成真空了啊 难道不是吗
Purposeless, emptiness. It's a vacuum, isn't it?

351
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,780
是啊... 你的空虚像什么
It's... What's your vacuum like?

352
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,760
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿 现在不行 小跟班
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Not now, Minion.

353
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,030
我和这死鱼眼的塑料玩具
I'm in a heated, existential discussion

354
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,830
正在进行关于存在的激烈辩论? 
with this dead- eyed, plastic desk toy.

355
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,580
有...有什么不对吗 先生
Is... Is something wrong, sir?

356
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,940
想想
Just think about it.

357
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,670
我们有了一切
We have it all.

358
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,380
然而我们一无所有
Yet, we have nothing.

359
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,880
现在没有挑战了
It's just too easy now.

360
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,750
抱歉 我很迷惑 先生
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

361
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,260
我的意思是 我们做到了 不是吗
I mean, we did it, right?

362
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,690
是啊 是你做到了啊
Well, you did it, sir.

363
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,360
是的 你说得非常清楚
Yes, you've made that perfectly clear.

364
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,440
那为什么我感觉这么...这么的不给力呢
Then why do I feel so... mel- on- choly.

365
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,100
不给力
"Mel- on- choly"?

366
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,900
- 不高兴 - 好吧...
- Unhappy. - Well...

367
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,670
那我们明天
What if tomorrow,

368
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,250
去绑架洛克斯安 瑞驰好不
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

369
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,350
那一直对您都很给力 您不是一直觉得这样很给力吗
That always seems to lift your spirits.

370
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,010
好主意 小跟班 但没有他 又有什么意思呢
Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?

371
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,160
- 他? 先生? - 没啥
- "Him," sir? - Nothing.

372
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,890
好吧 那么 那就... 当是考虑下吧
OK, all right. We'll just... that's something to consider...

373
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,060
...还有...我想我们先休整下
...and... Well, I think I'll just power down for a while then.

374
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,040
他总是在那里保护我们 那么可依靠
He was always there for us. Dependable.

375
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,710
也许我们认为他就应该这样 你们知道的 也许
Perhaps we took him for granted. You know, maybe,

376
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,080
直到失去我们才懂得他的珍贵
we never really know how good we have it until it's gone.

377
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,150
我们想念你 曼城卫士 我想你
We miss you, Metro Man. I miss you.

378
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,750
我还有一个问题要问超级大坏蛋 现在你满意了吧
And I have just one question for Megamind: Are you happy now?

379
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,800
这是洛克斯安 瑞驰 在没有英雄的城市为您报道
This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting from a city without a hero.

380
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,680
接下来 你想成为奴隶大军吗 你们该知道......
Coming up next, are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.

381
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,150
包起来当是孩子的圣诞礼物吧
And... wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas,

382
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,120
- 我们收工了 - 好了 明天见 哈尔
- 'cause we're done. - OK. See you tomorrow, Hal.

383
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,390
等等 洛丝 我家正要办个聚会
Wait. Roxie, I'm having a party at my house.

384
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,320
就算是放松一下什么的
It's gonna be, like, off the hook, or whatever.

385
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,160
你应该来玩玩 我找了个DJ
You should come over. I got a deejay,

386
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,200
租了个气垫房子 搞了酒
rented a bouncy house, made a gallon of dip.

387
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,330
很不错的捏
It's gonna be sick.

388
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,090
噢 我...我不知道 哈尔
Oh. I... I don't know, Hal.

389
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,290
我不想去人多的地方
I don't really feel like being around a bunch of people.

390
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,460
不 不 不 那最好了 因为只有你和我
No, no, no, that's the best part. It'll just be like you and me.

391
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,270
嗷 那很吸引人啊
Wow. That... that's certainly very tempting, but...

392
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,850
我还请了个婚礼摄影师
I did hire a wedding photographer. That's just in case we were like,

393
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,710
只是以防我们会做什么疯事
something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it.

394
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,320
就像是拍一张当纪念 你知道的
Like, maybe we should have this for, like, ever. Like a memory, you know?

395
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,250
我还是不去了
I'm gonna pass.

396
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,090
还有些工作要做 好了 再见
I have some work here that I need to do, anyway.

397
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,490
好吧 周四呢 周四可以考虑不
Cool. So Thursday? Soft Thursday?

398
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,930
- 晚安 哈尔 - 那就是说周四还是可以啦
- Good night, Hal. - That's a soft yes on Thursday.

399
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,830
我是怎么想的? 租了间气垫房子? 
What's wrong with me? Rented a bouncy house?

400
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,700
姑娘们都不喜欢气垫房子
Chicks don't like bouncy houses.

401
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,460
他们比较喜欢小丑
They like clowns.

402
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,600
笨蛋车 把我的手都弄破了
Stupid van! You broke my finger!

403
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,950
我铸成了大错
I've made a horrible mistake.

404
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,550
我无心要毁掉你的
I didn't mean to destroy you.

405
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,550
我的意思是 我曾经想要毁掉你
I mean, I meant to destroy you,

406
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,820
但没想到会成功
but I didn't think it would really work.

407
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,420
我们该怎么办? 
What are we supposed to do?

408
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,260
没有你 恶魔们在街上会泛滥成灾的
Without you, evil is running rampant through the streets.

409
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,960
我已经厌倦了在大街上捣乱
I'm so tired of running rampant through the streets.

410
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,060
干嘛要做坏人
What's the point of being bad

411
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,470
如果没有好人来阻止你? 
when there's no good to try and stop you?

412
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,370
一定要找人去阻止超级大坏蛋
Someone has to stop Megamind.

413
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,170
- 嘿 我们快撞了 - 你吓到我了
- Hey, we're closing soon. - You scared me.

414
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,680
- 巴里 对吗? - 伯纳德
- Barry, right? - Bernard.

415
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,150
伯纳德 刚才我只是... 呃 我在自言自语
Bernard. I was just... Well, I was talking to myself.

416
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,910
你可能认为我有点不对劲
You probably think I'm a little bit nuts.

417
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,850
我不可以直接冒犯客人
I'm not allowed to insult guests directly.

418
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,920
谢谢你 只是... 伯纳德 我想再待一会儿
Thank you. Just... Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

419
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,690
好吧
OK.

420
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,880
谢谢
Thanks.

421
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,460
我还有好多邪恶计划
I had so many evil plans in the works.

422
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,860
傻瓜光线
The illiteracy beam.

423
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,700
台风奶酪
Typhoon cheese.

424
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,530
机械绵羊
Robo- sheep.

425
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,970
后无来者的较量
Battles we will now never have.

426
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,710
我连道别的机会都没有
You know, I never had the chance to say goodbye.

427
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,180
所以只好趁现在了
So it's good that we have this time now.

428
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,410
摧毁这里之前
You know, before I destroy the place.

429
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,850
我对事不对人 只是这地方给我太多痛苦回忆
Nothing personal, it just brings back too many painful memories.

430
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,120
有人吗? 
Hello?

431
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,260
- 有人吗? - 是洛克斯安
- Hello? - Roxanne.

432
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,540
- 你的戏服真是俗不可耐 - 戏服? 
- That's a pretty tasteless costume. - Costume?

433
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,470
超级大坏蛋的头也没弄得这么夸张
Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

434
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,780
你居然还做了这么劣质的脱水枪仿制品 多么...
And you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...

435
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,550
你好? 有人吗? 
Hello? Is someone there?

436
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,150
你好? 谁在那里啊? 
Hello? Who's there?

437
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,420
伯纳德 是你啊
It's just you, Bernard.

438
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,560
对啊 只有我一个 伯纳德
Yes. It's just me. Bernard.

439
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,600
好吧 谢谢你让我在这透透气
Well, thank you for letting me stay.

440
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,240
听着 如果我是你的话 我不会停留超过2分钟37秒
Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds

441
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,000
我们准备拆墙和天花板
if I were you. We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

442
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,370
哇 听起来是一次大翻新耶
Wow, that sounds like quite the renovation.

443
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,170
那我和你一起下去好了
I guess I'll catch a ride down with you then.

444
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,580
我一直在想他最后关头会想做什么
I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last- minute escapes.

445
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,050
会吧 他真是个厉害角色
Yeah. He was really good at those.

446
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,930
噢 要是这世上有个重启按钮就好了
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.

447
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,990
我已经研究过这个按钮了
I've looked into the reset button.

448
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,860
科学根本做不到
The science is impossible.

449
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,660
噢 伯纳德...
Oh, Bernard...

450
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,570
我不知道你是...多愁善感 你还好吧? 
I didn't know you had... feelings. Are you OK?

451
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,080
曼城卫士已经走了 再也没人可以威胁超级大坏蛋
Metro Man's gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.

452
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,510
想开点吧 伯纳德
Oh, come on, Bernard.

453
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,380
只要恶魔尚在 正义使者一定会出击的
As long as there's evil, good will rise up against it.

454
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,780
希望如此
Oh, I wish.

455
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,650
我相信总会有人站出来阻止超级大坏蛋
I believe someone is gonna stand up to Megamind.

456
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,150
- 你真的这么想? - 对啊 我的意思是 俗话说
- You really think so? - Yeah. I mean, it's like they say,

457
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,820
时势造英雄
"Heroes aren't born, they're made."

458
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,290
英雄能造出来 对啊! 
Heroes can be made. That's it!

459
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,490
你只需要找到对的配件就行啦
All you need are the right ingredients.

460
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,600
- 对 勇敢 - 没错
- Yeah. Bravery. - Yes.

461
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,760
- 力量 - 当然
- Strength. - Of course.

462
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,130
- 决心 - 必需的! 
- Determination. - Imperative!

463
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,300
加一点DNA 噢 有了这个 人人都可以做英雄! 
And a smidgen of DNA. Oh, with that, anyone can be a hero!

464
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,840
对啊! 
Yeah!

465
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,080
我想我们要跑了
I think we should run!

466
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,810
再见! 
Bye!

467
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,750
是时候要忘掉过去了
Time to put the past behind us.

468
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,120
只关注未来...
Only the future...

469
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,650
太近喇 我现在真的被吓到了
I'm too close! I'm genuinely scared right now.

470
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,790
希望没被人看到
I hope no one's seeing this!

471
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,620
制造一个英雄? 等一下 什么? 为什么? 
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what? Why would you do that?

472
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,630
那我就有对手喇
So I have someone to fight.

473
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,290
小跟班 我是一个没英雄打的坏蛋
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

474
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,330
就像阴缺少了阳
A yin with no yang.

475
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,440
斗牛赛没有斗牛
A bullfighter with no bull to fight.

476
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,070
也就是说 我没动力
In other words, I have no purpose.

477
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,370
来 问我打算怎么做 来吧 问啊
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it. Go on! Ask!

478
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,040
你打算怎么做? 
How are you gonna do it?

479
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,620
我打算给某个人...还没想好是谁...
I'm going to give someone... I don't know who yet...

480
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,280
曼城卫士的能力
Metro Man's powers.

481
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,550
我要训练这个人变成蛮城的新英雄
I'm going to train that someone to become Metrocity's new hero.

482
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,790
我在这 跟上! 
Over here! Follow!

483
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,460
最终 我会和这位英雄决战
And then finally, I'm going to fight that hero

484
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,330
一场史诗般的正邪之战
in an epic battle of good and evil.

485
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,200
一切将和以前一样
Which will put everything back the way it was...

486
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,670
世界还是一样的愉快美好
...when the world was perfect and rosy.

487
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,240
小跟班 看着吧 曼城卫士的斗篷
Behold, Minion, Metro Man's cape.

488
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,850
看清楚了 告诉我你看到什么
Look closely. Tell me what you see.

489
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,740
- 头屑? - 对 就是他的DNA
- Dandruff? - Yes. It's his DNA.

490
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,750
从这里 我们可以找到他的超能力源头
From this, we'll extract the source of Metro Man's awesome power.

491
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,750
主人 我觉得这是个坏主意
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

492
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,330
对! 这是个超级邪恶的主意 无人能比
Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man.

493
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,330
但我意思是这种坏有点不怎么样...
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad that...

494
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,370
好吧 或许在你看来超级邪恶
...OK, you might think is good in your bad perception,

495
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,510
但普通人看来 只是有点坏而已
but from a good perception it... it's just plain bad.

496
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,200
噢 你根本不晓得什么是好坏
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.

497
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,550
现在 我们只有一次机会
Now, we have just one shot at this.

498
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,120
我们必须找个合适的对象 心地要高贵
We must find a suitable subject, someone of noble heart and mind.

499
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,840
总是无私地替别人着想
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

500
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,580
到底什么在响啊? 
What on Earth is that?

501
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,200
主人 听起来是从那里传出来的
It seems to be emanating from there, sir.

502
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,900
喔罗? 
OIIo.

503
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,360
是"哈罗"
It's "Hello."

504
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,870
哈罗? 像这样吗? 
Hello? Like that?

505
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,370
- 伯纳德 是我 洛克斯安 - 是洛克斯安
- Bernard, it's Roxanne. - It's Roxanne.

506
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,530
我打来是想谢谢你那天的鼓励
I just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day.

507
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,240
- 噢 你也启发了我 - 太好了
- Oh, you inspired me too. - Great!

508
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,810
是时候去阻止超级大坏蛋 告诉他我们不会任凭摆布
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.

509
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,970
噢 是吗? 她好可爱
Oh, really? She's so cute.

510
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,450
我对他的下落已经有头绪了
I'm already hot on his trail.

511
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,880
- 什么启发了你啊? - 主人? 
- And what gives you that idea? - Sir?

512
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,750
我刚找到他的秘密藏身处
I just found his secret hideout.

513
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,520
她怎么找到我的藏身处? ! 
How did she find my hideout? !

514
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,120
呃 你怎么找到他的藏身处的? 
How did you find his hideout?

515
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,600
这是曼城唯一一栋建筑物屋顶有假天文台
This is the only building in Metro City with a fake observatory on the roof.

516
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,600
算了 她没办法找到秘密入口的
OK. There's no way she'll find the secret entrance.

517
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,800
有张地毯写着"秘密入口"! 
There's a doormat here that says "Secrit Entrance"!

518
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,840
- 小跟班! - 我老忘记入口在哪
- Minion! - I kept forgetting where it was.

519
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,640
她会发现我们所有的秘密! 
She'll discover all our secrets!

520
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,510
- 噢 不! - 你这个笨科学废品
- Oh, no! - You dim- witted creation of science!

521
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,170
- 什么? - 什么? 不 不 不是你 洛克斯安
- What? - What? Oh, no, not you, Roxanne.

522
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,820
没有 我刚在对我母亲的骨灰瓮...大喊大叫
No, I was just yelling at my... mother's urn.

523
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,650
不要乱来 我很快到
Don't do anything. I'll be right there.

524
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,280
洛克斯安? 
Roxanne?

525
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,930
噢 不是吧 又不见了
Oh no, not again!

526
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,530
洛克斯安? 
Roxanne?

527
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,470
很高兴你在这 等一下 你怎么这么快就到啊? 
I'm glad you're here. Wait, how did you get here so fast?

528
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,270
呃 我...我刚好在这附近竞走
Well, I... I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.

529
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,540
穿着西装? 
In a suit?

530
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,270
这叫..."正式竞走" 那不重要
It's called... formal speed walking, but that's not important.

531
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,580
我来带路吧 这条路看起来比较刺激
I better take the lead. This way looks exciting.

532
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,080
不 那写着"出口"
No, it says "Exit."

533
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,950
也就是刺激的另一种说法 对吧
Which is the abbreviation for "exciting," right?

534
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,390
这里就是喇
This is the mother Iode!

535
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,320
- 哇 快看啊 - 哇

536
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,020
知道吗 我真的需要你帮忙解开这些秘密
You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.

537
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,560
- 真的吗? - 你是专家啊
- Really? - You're an expert

538
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,200
- 很了解超级大坏蛋的一切 对吧? - 对 没错
- on all things Megamind, right? - Yes. Right.

539
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,100
我们共同协力找到他的邪恶计划 并阻止他
Together, we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it.

540
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,960
- 要加入吗? - 噢 太好玩了
- Are you in? - Oh, what fun!

541
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,200
我就想听这句
That's what I want to hear.

542
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,470
小跟班 暗号: 派脑蝇出来
Minion, Code: Send In The Brain- bots.

543
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,670
你知道的 当暗号发出时...
You know, the whole point of a code is...

544
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,840
噢 暗号: 照做就对了 小跟班
Oh, Code: Just Do It, Minion.

545
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,450
入侵者! 入侵者! 入侵者! 
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

546
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,980
- 是我啊 你们这群蠢材 - 伯纳德! 
- It's me, you fools! - Bernard!

547
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,620
是你爹啊
It's Daddy!

548
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,490
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

549
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,190
- 你把伯纳德怎么样了? - 噢 伯纳德? 对了
- What have you done with Bernard? - Oh, Bernard? Oh, yes.

550
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,420
我正在折磨他
I'm doing horrible things to that man.

551
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,070
我不想伤害他 不过那些镭射光线 钉子
I don't want to get into it, but lasers, spikes.

552
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,470
不 求求你! 不要! 不要用镭射光线 不要用钉子
No, please! No! Not the lasers and the spikes!

553
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,840
- 你知道钻孔器吧 - 噢 不要! 不要钻孔! 
- You know the drill. - Oh, no! Not the drill!

554
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,410
- 放他走 不然的话... - 不然什么? 
- Let him go or... - Or what?

555
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,670
不然的话我就会知道这把奇形怪状枪的用途
Or I'm gonna find out what this weird- Iooking gun does.

556
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,110
不 别开枪! 别用这把枪! 
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!

557
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,720
我这就去救他
I'll just go get him.

558
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,350
- 放开我 你这恶魔 - 做不到! 
- Unhand me, you fiend! - Never!

559
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,720
他的力量太强大了! 
His strength's too much!

560
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,260
噢 我做到了! 
Oh, I work out!

561
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,090
真的奏效了 你好苗条啊
Well, it's really paying off! You're so fit,

562
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,360
还有着不可思议的魅力
and strangely charismatic.

563
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,130
你没事吧? 
Are you OK?

564
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,140
我尽力了 但他太厉害了
I did my best, but he's too fantastic.

565
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,360
给我吧 这么重的枪我帮你拿
Here. Let me carry that heavy gun for you.

566
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,970
我来就好
I got us covered.

567
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,240
- 放手 这是我的枪! - 伯纳德快跑! 
- Let go. It's mine! - Bernard, run!

568
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,610
洛克斯安? 
Roxanne?

569
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,580
- 快被你弄烂了! - 给我! 
- You're going to break it! - Give it to me!

570
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,410
噢 不! 
Oh, no!

571
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,650
洛克斯安? ! 
Roxanne? !

572
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,130
那到底是谁啊? 
Who on Earth is that?

573
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,280
- 救命啊! - 洛克斯安! 
- Help! - Roxanne!

574
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,850
伯纳德! 你是对的 这门后真够刺激的
Bernard! You were right about that door being exciting.

575
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,410
- 入侵者! 入侵者! - 走这边
- Intruder! Intruder! - This way.

576
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,040
入侵者! 入侵者! 入侵者! 
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

577
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,290
你在干嘛? 
What are you doing?

578
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,290
这能阻止它们 拿着! 
This'll stop them. Here!

579
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,260
有点太极端了 不是吗? 
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

580
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,860
- 快扔啊! - 爹爹我很抱歉
- Just throw it! - Daddy's sorry.

581
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,340
- 哇 真刺激啊 - 对啊
- Wow. That was really exciting. - Yeah.

582
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,110
- 你好强大啊 - 我知道
- You were very strong in there. - I know.

583
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,110
除了曼城卫士 我没见过有人能阻止他
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.

584
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,340
- 怎么回事? - 哈尔 发生什么事了? 
- What's going on? - Hal, what happened?

585
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
我想有只蜜蜂撞到我鼻子了
I think a bee flew up my nose.

586
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,080
我正准备冲进去救你
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you,

587
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,950
但貌似有50个忍者袭击我 所以我必须要先对付他们
but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me, so I had to beat 'em all up,

588
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,030
我搞定了 我...他们全部都哭着求饶...
and I did, and I... They were all, like, crying and stuff...

589
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,360
- 哇 好勇敢啊 对吗? - 你是谁? 
- Wow, a brave one, isn't he? - Who are you?

590
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,660
噢 这...这是伯纳德 我的搭档
Oh, thi... this is Bernard. He's my partner.

591
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,200
- 搭档? - 对 对 搭档
- Partner? - Yes. Yes. Partner.

592
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:32,470
听着 搭档 我才是她的搭档 她只是不晓得自己在说什么
Well, look, "partner," I'm her partner. She doesn't know what she's saying.

593
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,970
她有创伤后遗症
She's been through a traumatic experience.

594
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,580
我想我要带他回家了 再次谢谢你伯纳德
I'd better take him home. Thanks again, Bernard.

595
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,820
搭档 我明天打给你
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

596
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,320
好啊 没问题 等你电话
Yeah, OK. I'd like that.

597
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,120
真奇怪啊你
That was weird for everybody,

598
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,320
因为你意外地不抱我反而抱他
'cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me.

599
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,730
主人? 主人! 
Sir? Sir!

600
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,300
暗号: 你知道那是谁了吗? 
Code: Did You Find Out who It was?

601
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,060
暗号: 把车开过来
Code: Get The Car.

602
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,400
暗号: 马上到 主人
Code: Right Away, Sir.

603
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,640
- 再见! - 明天见 哈尔
- Bye- bye! - See you tomorrow, Hal.

604
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,220
我不会锁门 免得你晚点想来看我
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.

605
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,450
这男的是谁啊? 我们已经被注入神力了
Who is this man we've infused with godlike power?

606
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,200
主人 他叫哈尔 斯图尔特 28岁
Well, sir, his name's Hal Stewart. He's 28 years old.

607
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,630
没有犯罪前科 事实上完全没记录
No criminal record. Actually no records at all.

608
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,360
很明显这个男人一事无成
Apparently this man hasn't accomplished anything.

609
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,340
小跟班 还没而已 还没...而已
Not yet, Minion. Not... yet.

610
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,310
难道日子不能变得有趣一点吗? 
Could this day get anymore fun- tastic?

611
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,470
所以我要过去射毁他的力量 因为这根本就是个错误
So, I will just go ahead and diffuse him since this is clearly a mistake.

612
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,620
不 小跟班 这活儿远没那么简单
No, Minion! There's something much more powerful at work here.

613
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,320
这不是错误 这是命中注定的
This is no mistake. It's destiny.

614
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,950
哈尔 斯拖尔特! 准备迎接你的命运吧! 
Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!

615
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,460
哈尔? 哈尔 斯拖尔特? 
Hal? Hal Shtewart?

616
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,400
- 嘿 在床上! - 我说得对吗? 
- Hey! In the bed! - Am I saying it right?

617
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,900
念"斯图尔特"才对
"Stewart."

618
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,830
想打劫吗? 
Is this a robbery?

619
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,400
因为对面的女士拥有更多值钱东西
'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.

620
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,700
噢 看啊 是哈尔 斯图尔特 快啊 喷一下
Oh, look, it's Hal Stewart. Quick, the spray.

621
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,200
用光了
All out.

622
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,570
- 那就用失忆棒吧 - 噢 对啊
- Well, use the Forget- Me Stick. - Oh, right.

623
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,880
看着他
Just look at him.

624
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,520
不 他完全不像个英雄的样子
No, he doesn't look quite the hero- type to me.

625
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,420
小跟班 你真是个讨厌鬼
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

626
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,590
无论资质好坏 都可以做英雄
A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.

627
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,120
我闻到英雄的气息
I smell a hero.

628
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,660
我闻到有东西糊了
I smell something burning.

629
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,860
起作用喇! 各就各位! 
I think it's working. Places! Places!

630
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,160
准备好 各就各位
Places! Places! Places.

631
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,670
你准备好伪装了吗? 
Do you have your disguise?

632
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,640
什么啊? 
What?

633
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,450
噢 你看上去太美了
Oh, you look fantastic.

634
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,830
醒来吧 我最伟大的创造
Rise my glorious creation.

635
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,790
醒来吧 到爹爹这里来
Rise, and come to Papa.

636
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,160
- 发生什么了? - 别紧张 孩子
- What's going on? - Easy my child.

637
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,560
- 你是谁? - 是我把你送到这个星球来的
- Who are you? - I sent you to this planet

638
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,640
教会你正义 荣耀 和高尚
to teach you about justice, honor, and nobility.

639
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,940
我是你父亲
I am your father.

640
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,070
你是我的宇宙父亲? 
So you're like my space dad?

641
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,970
对 我是你的宇宙父亲
Yeah, I'm like your space dad.

642
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,250
那你是? 
And you are what?

643
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,140
我是你的宇宙继母
I'm your space stepmom.

644
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,220
我最近整形了
I've had some work done recently.

645
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,190
这是梦吗? 
Is this some kind of dream?

646
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,420
是梦想成真
This is a dream come true.

647
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,760
你已经被赐予深不可测的能力
You've been blessed with unfathomable power.

648
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,830
- 什么能力 - 深不可测
- What kind of power? - Unfathomable.

649
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,330
就是深...得无法了解
It's unf... without fathom.

650
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,730
对 我们来指导你
Yeah. We've come to guide you

651
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,600
成为蛮城的新英雄
on your path to be Metrocity's new hero

652
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,940
与超天才超级大坏蛋决战
and battle the super- genius of Megamind.

653
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,240
我知道你一时无法接受这么多
I know this is a lot to take in.

654
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,510
这也许需要几个月时间来理解
It may take months for you to come to grips.

655
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,450
开什么玩笑! 
No freaking way!

656
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,460
我还没说完
I wasn't finished.

657
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,700
我要当英雄! 
I'm gonna be a hero!

658
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,490
我要当英雄喇! 
I'm gonna be a hero!

659
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,500
看吧 小跟班 他是完美的
See, Minion, he's perfect!

660
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,130
开始! 
And... action!

661
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,970
- 帮帮我! - 我没事! 
- Someone help me! - I'm OK!

662
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,840
你这个...坏蛋! 
You... Bad!

663
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,710
杀! 杀! 杀! 
Zap! Zap! Zap!

664
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,580
燃烧恶魔的火焰光亮无比
The flames of my evil burn bright.

665
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,320
现在你来说些什么报复我吧
Now you say something cool back at me.

666
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,490
看 完全不会痛 感觉不到什么
Look. It doesn't even hurt. Don't even feel it.

667
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,330
不不不 不是 肚子往下 手往上 像个曼城卫士
No, no, no, no, no. Stomach down, hands up. Like Metro Man.

668
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,370
- 哇 等一下! - 小心
- Whoa! Wait! - Watch out.

669
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,970
他没救了 没救了! 
He's hopeless. Hopeless!

670
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,700
- 或许我们可以改变策略 - 真的吗? 
- Maybe we should change tactics. - You think so?

671
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,440
噢 你知道男孩的
Oh, you know how boys are.

672
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,950
他们喜欢电脑游戏
They love video games.

673
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,680
- 我可以找几个玩伴 - 等不及了
- I could throw a few parts together. - Can't wait.

674
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,690
大声地笑 笑脸
LOL. Smiley face.

675
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,150
等不及什么 主人? 
Can't wait for what, sir?

676
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,290
真是个有趣的故事
That was such a funny story.

677
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,160
顺便说一句 说得很精彩
And brilliantly told, by the way.

678
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,850
好了 轮到你说一个
OK, now you tell one.

679
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,500
伯纳德我从不知道你这么风趣
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.

680
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,100
我也从没听过你笑
And I never heard you laugh before.

681
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,400
对啊 好一阵子了 感觉很好啊
Yeah, it's been a while. Feels pretty good.

682
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,980
开始
And action.

683
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,380
搞定你喇! 
Gotcha!

684
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,380
- 你不常出外的 对吗? - 噢 多好玩啊
- You don't get out much, do you? - Oh, what fun!

685
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,690
我小时候和我妈来过这里
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.

686
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,530
是我最爱做的事情之一
It was one of my favorite things to do.

687
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,960
现在看来 是个垃圾堆
Now look at it. It's a dump.

688
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,780
为什么我们要打扫城市啊 主人? 
Why are we cleaning up the city, sir?

689
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,420
我们不希望咱们的新英雄在垃圾堆里战斗吧? 
Well, we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump now, do we?

690
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,490
他们都回来了 可是怎么会? 为什么? 
They're all back. But how? Why?

691
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:23,020
或许超级大坏蛋没有那么坏呢
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

692
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,590
就是这样喇
That's it.

693
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,170
飞吧 像鸽子般飞翔吧
Be free, my beautiful dove!

694
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,070
好吧 好吧
OK, OK.

695
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,510
曼城卫士和我从来都没有在一起
Metro Man and I were never a couple.

696
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,770
- 可我还以为你们俩... - 我知道 所有人都这么想
- But I thought you two were... - I know. Everybody did.

697
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,610
只是...他不是我喜欢的类型
It's just... Well, he was never really my type.

698
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,080
真的? 
Really?

699
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,280
好了 轮到你告诉我
OK, now you tell me something.

700
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,180
一些你从没告诉别人的秘密
Something you've never told anyone.

701
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,460
呃 在学...学校...
Well, in sh... school...

702
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,360
没有人喜欢过我
...none of the other kids really liked me.

703
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,790
我从来就是被剩下的那个
I was always the last one picked for everything.

704
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,210
我没和你在同一间学校太遗憾了
It's too bad that we didn't go to the same school.

705
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,440
哈尔 我想你已经准备好了
Hal, I think you're ready for this.

706
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,550
- 我有儿子了? - 没有
- Do I have a son? - No.

707
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,350
你真幽默
You make me laugh.

708
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,490
它可以伸展的 给你穿的
It stretches. It's for you.

709
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,280
这个字母T是什么意思? 
Hey, what's the T stand for?

710
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,790
太阳神
Titan.

711
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,900
"太阳神"? 什么意思? 
"Titan"? What's that supposed to mean?

712
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,590
只有这个名字可以注册成商标了
It was the only name I could trademark.

713
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,640
哈尔 在你生命里 有特别的人吗? 
Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?

714
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,840
还没有 不过...有一个很漂亮的女孩
No, not yet. But... there's this really, really good- Iooking one

00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,100
我的眼睛总离不开她

00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,620
那很好
That's very good.

717
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,080
- 恋情是很鼓舞人的 - 我也是这么认为的
- Romance is very inspiring. - That's what I hear.

718
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:03,120
你要做的是拯救她 那么她就是你的了
All you have to do is save her and she'll be yours.

719
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,890
- 我想要炸油条? - 我! 
- Who wants churros? - I do!

720
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,160
- 我要 谢谢你 宇宙继母 - 炸油条一直陪伴你
- I do, yeah. Thanks, Space Stepmom. - Churros all the way around.

721
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,930
数到三 拔出油条
On the count of three, unsheathe your churro.

722
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,690
一二三! 
One, two, three!

723
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,000
敬太阳神! 
To Titan!

明天 你会和超级大坏蛋决斗 整个城市将会知道你的名字
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind, and the city will know your name.

725
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,000
城市的公园恢复往日的风采
...the city's parks restored to their original glory,

726
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,050
街道治安稳定 银行重新开张
the streets the safest they've been, the banks reopened.

727
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,150
超级大坏蛋发生什么了吗? 
Has something happened to Megamind?

728
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,020
难道有人降服了这只怪兽? 
Has someone tamed this monster?

729
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,350
这是洛克斯安 瑞驰 谨慎乐观
This is Roxanne Ritchi, cautiously optimistic,

730
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,550
愉悦困扰地为你报导
and pleasantly confused.

731
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,720
今晚你看起来心情不错啊 主人
Well, you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.

732
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,560
对啊 小跟班 还要多长时间啊? 
Oh, yes. How long is this going to take, Minion?

733
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,630
只剩一点点修改了 主人 很快做好
Just a few alterations, sir, and I will be done

734
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,930
你的最可怕斗篷
with your most terrifying cape yet!

735
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,470
我要把它命名为...
I'm calling it...

736
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,830
黑曼巴蛇! 
...the Black Mamba...

737
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,640
黑曼巴蛇 很好
Black Mamba. Perfect.

738
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,550
天啊 我快迟到了 我要走了
Gosh, I am running late. I have to go.

739
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,780
什么? 哪...你要去哪里 主人? 
What? Where... Where are you going, sir?

740
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,220
明天早上我们和太阳神初次登场战斗
We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning.

741
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,360
我们还没测试过你的大战斗服呢
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.

742
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,430
小跟班 你处理好细节先 我要...帮人跑腿办件事
You attend to the details, Minion. I have to... run a quick errand.

743
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,850
你不会帮人跑腿的
You don't run errands.

744
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,330
- 发生什么了? - 什么? 
- What's going on here? - What?

745
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,730
噢 等一下
Oh, wait a minute.

746
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,430
你擦了名牌香水? 
Are you wearing Jean Paul Gaultier's Pour Homme?

747
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,970
只是我的体香而已 车钥匙在哪? 
It's just my natural musk. Now, where are the car keys?

748
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,530
和瑞驰小姐有关 对不对? 
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it?

749
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,140
你在和她约会
You're going on a date with her.

750
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,840
不是 兄弟 别闹了
No, my main man. Get out of town.

751
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,680
噢 糟了 糟了 你爱上她了
Oh, this is bad. This is bad. You've fallen in love with her.

752
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,220
小跟班 你太多管闲事了 把钥匙给我
You are forgetting your place, Minion. Now give me the keys.

753
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,390
如果洛克斯安发现你是谁 那怎么办? 
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?

754
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,020
她不会发现的 不然我干嘛还撒谎? 
She will never find out. That's the point of lying.

755
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,660
老实说 如果我不认识你
Honestly, if I didn't know any better,

756
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,770
我会以为你第一天来当恶魔
I'd think this was your first day of being evil.

757
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,340
不! 
No!

758
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,770
这太过分了喔
This has gone far enough!

759
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,940
噢 你翅膀硬了啊
Oh, that was really grown- up!

760
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,180
主人 主人 求求你 这是为你好
Sir, sir, please. It's for your own good.

761
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,780
噢 你知道什么
Oh, what do you know?

762
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,180
我或许不知道太多 但我知道:
I may not know much, but I do know this:

763
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,090
坏人是得不到心爱的女人的
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

764
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,060
或许我再也不想当坏人了
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

765
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,230
你听到了
You heard me!

766
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,130
你是谁啊? 
Who are you?

767
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,170
- 快把钥匙给我! - 不给! 
- Now, give me the keys! - No!

768
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,840
我生来就是要照顾你
My sole purpose in life is to look after you.

769
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,000
我不需要你的照顾
Well, I don't need you to look after me.

770
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,440
你说什...你说什么? 你不需要我? 
What are you s... What are you saying? You don't need me?

771
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,180
让我把话说清楚 暗号: 我不需要你
Let me make it clear. Code: I Don't Need You.

772
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,180
你知道吗? 你知道吗? 
You know what? You know what?

773
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,220
暗号: 我会收拾行李 然后离开! 
Code: I'll Just Pack My Thing And Go!

774
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,190
- 暗号: 随便你! - 暗号: 我也随便你! 
- Code: Fine! - Code: Fine Back!

775
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,290
- 祝你约会顺利 - 我会的
- Well, good luck on your date! - I will!

776
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,160
- 这完全说不过去 - 我知道
- That doesn't even make any sense! - I know!

777
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,530
我快接近真相了 我可以感觉到它
I know I am so close. I can feel it.

778
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,810
好吧 好吧 我得回想一下
OK, OK. I just have to take a step back.

779
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,140
等一下
Wait a minute.

780
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,720
太阳神
"Titan."

781
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,030
- 太阳神是什么东西? - 我的顺风耳听到东西喇
- What's a Titan? - My super- ears are burning.

782
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,270
我通常只听到罪犯的声音 你没有捣乱吧? 
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?

783
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,370
我在开玩笑 我在开玩笑
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.

784
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,210
- 我叫太阳神 - 太阳神
- The name's Titan. - Titan.

785
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,870
正直可敬的英雄守护者
Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome.

786
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,250
你叫什么名字? 我开玩笑的 我知道你的一切
What's your name? Just kidding. I know everything about you.

787
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,050
我...我带了花来
And I... And I brought some flowers.

788
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:30,720
不知道你喜欢什么 所以我全部都带来的
Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed, you know, all of them.

789
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,930
好吧 不喜欢花? 算了 忽略这些花
OK. You don't like flowers? OK, forget the flowers.

790
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,190
你想干嘛? 
What do you want?

791
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,700
或许我们可以一起去兜风 飞遍整个城市
Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town.

792
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,360
先互相了解一下
Get to know each other first.

793
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,970
一定会让你很兴奋的
This must be very thrilling for you.

794
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,470
你知道你在干嘛吗? 
What do you think you're doing? !

795
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,910
噢 我飞太快了吗? 你是对的
Oh, am I moving too fast? You're probably right.

796
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,810
我应该先拯救你几次 再进行浪漫桥段的
I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic.

797
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,810
救到你喇
Saved ya.

798
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,850
有我这个伟大的英雄 你真够幸运的
You are lucky to have such a great hero here.

799
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,880
- 你居然敢... - 噢 糟了 赶快找人来救她
- Don't you ever... - Oh, no! Somebody do something!

800
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,990
噢 对了 对了 我来喇 我来喇
Oh, right, right, duh. I gotcha. I gotcha.

801
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,400
好刺激啊 你差点没命了
That was a close one. You almost died,

802
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,230
- 但我救了你 - 大楼! 
- but I saved you. - Building!

803
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,300
接住你了 不好意思 你刚刚说什么
Gotcha! I'm sorry. What were you saying?

804
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,340
我救你的声音太大 听不见
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.

805
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,070
放我下来 马上
Put me down! Right now!

806
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,700
好 知道了 知道了 等一下
OK, all right. All right, hold on.

807
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,780
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

808
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:33,120
我想我是有点 有点为你而疯
I suppose I'm a, I'm a little crazy, about you.

809
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,550
你到底是谁
Who are you, really?

810
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,160
好了 准备好大吃一惊吧 小姐
Oh, right. Well, prepare to have your mind blown, little lady.

811
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,820
- 当当 - 哈尔? 
- Ta- da. - Hal?

812
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,800
正是 是不是很棒 现在没什么能分开我们了
Yeah. Isn't this great? Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

813
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,270
- 不 一点都不棒 - 哇 这可是我们的第一次吵架
- No. It's not great. - Wow. Our first fight.

814
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,130
太有我俩的特色了 我们就像一对老夫妻一样
This is so us. We're like an old married couple.

815
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,280
听着 根本没有"我们"这个说法 永远都不会有
Look, there is no "us," OK? There will never be an "us."

816
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,270
可是...我有超能力啊
But... I have powers.

817
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,310
我有个斗篷 我是个好人
I have a cape. I'm the good guy.

818
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,950
你是个好人 哈尔 可是你不明白
You are a good guy, Hal, but you don't understand.

819
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,990
- 我们得搞清楚为什么... - 不 不 这...
- We need to find out why... - No, no. This...

820
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,750
- 哈尔 深呼吸 - 不该是这样的
- Hal, just take a deep breath - This isn't right!

821
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,690
- 听我说 - 你应该和我在一起
- And listen to me for a moment. - You're supposed to be with me!

822
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,160
我警告你 哈尔
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

823
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,820
叫我太阳神 叫太阳神 不要叫我哈尔
It's Titan! It's Titan, not Hal!

824
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,320
- 伯纳德 - 洛克斯安
- Bernard. - Roxanne.

825
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:45,790
- 对不起 我来晚了 - 哇 你的头发看起来受了点刺激啊
- Sorry I'm late. - Wow, your hair looks exciting.

826
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,860
今天晚上刺激的可不止这点
Not the only exciting development of the night.

827
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,590
超级大坏蛋造出来一个新的英雄 我知道他为什么这么做
Megamind's created a new hero, and I know why.

828
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,140
现在都说得通了 他怀念有人教训他的日子
It all makes sense now. He missed getting his butt kicked,

829
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,600
所以就造出来一个新的英雄
so he created a new hero

830
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,440
- 好有人教训他 - 正是
- to kick it for him. - Yeah.

831
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,010
可是为什么他选上了哈尔
But why would he pick Hal?

832
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,510
哈尔是最糟糕的选择了
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.

833
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,010
哇 真是让人难以接受啊
Wow. That's a lot to take in.

834
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,980
这太难以置信了
It boggles my mind.

835
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,350
太让我难以接受了 不过 我确信
I am extremely boggled. You know, I'm sure we'll get

836
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,290
我们总会弄清楚是谁教训谁的
to the bottom of who's kicking whose butt.

837
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,090
可是现在呢 我们还是 好好享受我们的时光吧
But in the meantime, let's enjoy each other's company.

838
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,930
抱歉 伯纳德 你是对的
I'm sorry, Bernard, of course, you're right.

839
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,760
我应该闭嘴了
You know, I could use a breather.

840
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,230
敬伯纳德
To Bernard,

841
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,700
你是我这疯狂的 乱七八糟的世界里 唯一正常的存在
for being the only normal thing in my crazy, upside- down world.

842
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,140
为正常 干杯
To... being normal.

843
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,290
- 洛克斯安 - 嗯? 
- Roxanne? - Yes?

844
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,150
如果我不那么正常
Say I wasn't so normal.

845
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,960
如果我这人秃头 而且肤色跟常人不太一样
Let's say I was bald and had the complexion of,

846
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:00,070
我只是说如果 并不特指谁
of a popular primary color, as a random, nonspecific example.

847
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,870
- 你还会愿意和我做朋友吗 - 那当然
- Would you still enjoy my company? - Of course!

848
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,940
不能以貌取人嘛
You don't judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside.

849
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,300
听你这么说我放心了
That's a relief to hear.

850
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,340
看一个人应该看他的言行才是
You judge them based on their actions.

851
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,140
这无足挂齿 是吧
Well, that seems kind of petty, don't you think?

852
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,910
怎么了 怎么了
What? What?

853
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,840
不要看我 出了点技术故障
Don't look at me! Just a technical glitch!

854
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,280
现在别看 不要介意
Don't look yet! Well, never mind that.

855
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,810
好了
OK.

856
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,490
我们说到哪里了
Where were we?

857
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,690
- 是你... - 镇定 镇定
- You... - Now, now, hold on.

858
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,330
是你
You!

859
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,080
我可以解释的
I can explain!

860
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,430
你刚刚说的还算数吗? 
What about everything you just said?

861
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,620
你说过不以貌取人的
About judging a book by its cover?

862
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,700
好 那我们来说说内涵
Well, let's take a look at the contents then, shall we?

863
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,990
你毁了曼城卫士 接管了这城市
You destroyed Metro Man, you took over the city,

864
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,930
你让我在乎你
and then, you actually got me to care about you!

865
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:47,770
你为什么这么坏 耍我
Why are you so evil? Tricking me?

866
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,950
对你有什么好处
What could you possibly hope to gain?

867
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,050
等等 我不信
Wait a minute. I don't believe this.

868
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,960
你不会真的以为我会和你在一起吧
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?

869
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:11,030
是啊
No.

870
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,660
小跟班 你说的对
OK, Minion! You were right!

871
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,770
我...不完全对
I was... less right!

872
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,670
我们应该坚持我们擅长的 做坏人
We should stick to what we're good at... being bad.

873
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,880
小跟班
Minion?

874
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,160
你
You there!

875
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,160
对 就是你
Yeah, you.

876
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,200
把黑曼巴蛇拿出来
Bring out the Black Mamba.

877
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,900
好了 太阳神 咱就是堕落也要有范
OK, Titan. It's time to go down in style.

878
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,600
我听说新出现了一个英雄 敢挑战我
I hear there's a new hero who dares challenge my evil.

879
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,430
那个叫太阳神的在哪
Where is the one they call Titan?

880
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,270
你有胆就来挑战我
Challenge me if you dare!

881
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,630
哦 不 我们要撞车了
Oh no. We're gonna crash!

882
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,170
这也太尴尬了
This is embarrassing.

883
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:16,010
整个就是欠考虑 没技术含量
Of all the inconsiderate, bone- headed...

884
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,120
...不负责任 鲁莽...
...irresponsible, rude...

885
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,780
这就叫不专业
Unprofessional, that's what this is!

886
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,190
如果是曼城卫士会让我等这么久吗
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

887
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,360
当然不会 他可是够专业的
Of course not! He was a pro!

888
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,470
嘿 超级大坏蛋 我正想见你呢
Hey, Megamind! You're actually the guy I want to see.

889
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,000
门在那
Also, there's a door here.

890
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,940
你知道我等了你多久吗
Do you have any idea how long I waited for you?

891
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,470
不不不 我不明白你在说什么
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.

892
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,940
你能不能安静一会 我正在打这关
Could you just, just shut up for one second. I'm trying to beat this level.

893
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,480
你到底有想过要出场吗
Were you even planning on showing up?

894
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,780
这是什么
What's this?

895
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,740
你从哪弄来的这些
Where did you get all this stuff?

896
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,510
这不是我的
It doesn't belong to me.

897
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,590
- 你偷的? - 帅吧? 
- You stole it? - Pretty cool, right?

898
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,120
- 不不不 你是个英雄 - 当英雄是窝囊废干的事
- No, no, no, no! You're a hero! - Being a hero is for losers!

899
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,160
工作工作工作 一天24小时 一周7天 这有什么意义
It's work, work, work, 24/7, and for what?

900
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,460
我演这出就是为了得到那女孩
I only took the gig to get the girl,

901
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,960
结果发现洛克斯安什么都不愿意跟我一起做
and it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

902
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,860
- 洛克斯安 瑞驰? - 正是 洛克斯安 瑞驰! 
- Roxanne Ritchi? - Yeah! Roxanne Ritchi!

903
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,400
我看见她跟人吃晚餐
I saw her having dinner and making googly eyes

904
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,510
还对着那个傻乎乎的书呆子 把眼睛瞪得溜圆! 
at some intellectual dweeb!

905
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,900
谁稀罕这些玩意啊
Who needs all that noise?

906
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,980
所以我觉得我俩应该合作
That's why I think we should team up.

907
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,940
你 等等 你说什么
You... Wait... What?

908
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,210
我的力量 加上你的聪明
With my power, and your big- headedness,

909
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,440
- 我们就可以统治这个城市 - 你想合作? 
- we could rule the city! - You want to team up?

910
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,250
我还设计了我俩的行头
I even drew up some new costume designs, see?

911
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,720
- 设计行头? - 你负责出谋划策
- Costume designs? - You'd be the brains,

912
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,220
所以你的标志就是个大脑
so you'd get a little brain,

913
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,860
再戴上个墨镜什么的
wearing glasses on your costume, or something.

914
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,020
而我就是那个主角 我就要
And since I'm the cool one, I'd have, like,

915
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,590
两个击剑的坦克...
two tanks swordfighting...

916
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,960
我没办法相信
I can't believe you.

917
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,760
你的天赋 你的力量
All your gifts, all your powers,

918
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:45,530
而你却把它们挥霍在浪费自己的私欲上
and you... you squander them for your own personal gain.

919
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,640
- 对 - 不 我才是唱白脸的
- Yes! - No! I'm the villain!

920
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,840
你是唱红脸的 我来做坏事
You're the good guy! I do something bad,

921
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:54,510
你来抓我 我造你的原因就是这个
and you come and get me! That's why I created you.

922
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,520
对 对 你疯了 宇宙老爸告诉我...
Yeah, right. You're nuts. Space Dad told me...

923
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,920
看 我就是你的宇宙老爸
Look, I'm your space dad!

924
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,530
你应该更像曼城卫士
You should be more like Metro Man.

925
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,460
- 你骗我 - 哦 你不喜欢那样? 
- You tricked me? - Oh, don't like that?

926
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,820
还有呢
Well, there's more.

927
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:15,330
我还是跟洛克斯安拍拖的那个书呆子
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.

928
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,240
- 不 - 而且我俩进展神速
- No. - And we were smooching up a storm!

929
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,530
你被我抓到 我就
When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna...

930
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,370
对 对 我知道 伸张正义吧
Yes! Yes, I know! Bring me to justice.

931
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,980
哦 神啊 我可怀念这样了
Oh God, how I've missed this.

932
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,950
英雄重重地打出了他的第一拳
And the hero strikes the first blow.

933
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,420
而坏人马上反击
But evil returns with a backhand!

934
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,030
耶
Yes!

935
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,470
出来 你个小怪物! 
Come out, you little freak!

936
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,040
我要看看你那大头放在人行道上是什么效果
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement!

937
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,620
最老套的把戏就把你给打败了
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book!

938
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,020
你个蓝不啦叽的笨蛋
You little blue twerp!

939
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,150
预备
En garde!

940
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,170
哦 要的就是这精神! 
Oh, now that's the spirit!

941
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,830
我挡! 我刺! 我再挡! 
Parry! Thrust! Parry again!

942
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,240
现在 计谋放一边 该是把戏上场了
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter!

943
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,240
你先
You go first!

944
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,850
好了 我不知道怎么办才好了
OK! Look, I'm not sure where to go with that!

945
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,610
这一招是为了你偷走我女朋友
This one's for stealing my girlfriend!

946
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,880
这一招是为了你装宇宙老爸耍我
This one's for Space Dad making a fool out of me!

947
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:55,000
还有 超级大坏蛋 还有这一招是为了宇宙继母! 你骗了她
And, Megamind, this one's for Space Stepmom! You lied to her!

948
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,500
干的好 这场架打得很好 很好
Well done. I thought that battle went really, really well.

949
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,670
- 不过 我还想评论几句 - 评论? 
- I mean, I have a few notes. - Notes?

950
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,900
这不重要 你可以把我扔进监狱了
But they can wait. You can take me to jail now.

951
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:07,840
不不不 我想的是太平间 你死定了
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue. You're dead!

952
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,210
喂喂喂喂喂 游戏可不是这么玩的
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't how you play the game.

953
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,350
游戏结束了
Game over.

954
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,450
脑蝇! 
Brain- bots!

955
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,690
我要求暂停
I'm calling time out!

956
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,540
暂停 暂停 暂停
Time out? Time out! Time out!

957
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,050
脑蝇 启动自动防故障装置
Brain- bots, initiate the fail- safe.

958
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,550
你猜怎么着 这个棕色的家伙 是铜做的
Guess what, Buster Brown? It's made from copper.

959
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,360
这个你可束手无策
You're powerless against it.

960
01:03:56,530 --> 01:04:00,870
我就是用这个来打败... 曼城卫士
It's the very same metal used to defeat... Metro Man?

961
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,570
不要再拿我和曼城卫士比较了
You should stop comparing me to Metro Man!

962
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,680
你可以逃跑 超级大坏蛋 可你躲不掉的
You can run, Megamind, but you can't hide!

963
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,880
我们得救了 我们得救了
We're saved! We're saved!

964
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,520
你叫什么名字 新的英雄? 
What's your name, new hero?

965
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,880
- 我叫太阳神 - 谢谢你
- It's Titan. - Thank you!

966
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,620
谢谢你 太阳神解放了我们
Thank you! Titan has freed us!

967
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:30,290
哦 我可不会说"解放" 应该说是新的统治
Oh, I wouldn't say "free." More like under new management.

968
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:38,200
- 你想要什么? - 太阳神变坏了
- What do you want? - Titan's turned evil.

969
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,330
恭喜你 你的天才计划又背后捅了你一刀
Congratulations. Another one of your genius plans has backfired on you.

970
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,710
守门的怎么会让你上来的
And why did my doorman let you up?

971
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,310
卡洛斯
Carlos.

972
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,470
求你了 洛克斯安 别关门 别 我要你帮我
Please, Roxanne, no. No. I need your help.

973
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,310
你怎么会需要我帮你
Why do you need my help?

974
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,860
因为你是我认识的最聪明的人
Because you're the smartest person I know.

975
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,720
可你不能躲在这里
But you can't hide here.

976
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,060
铜应该有效的 铜怎么会没用
The copper should have worked. Why didn't the copper work?

977
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,720
上次铜就很有用啊
The copper worked perfectly well last time.

978
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,730
铜 你根本是在胡说八道
Copper? You're not making any sense.

979
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,660
听着 如果我们找不到太阳神的弱点
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness,

980
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,390
他会把整个城市都毁了
he'll destroy the whole city.

981
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,900
- 好吧 有什么我能帮得上的 - 我们要找到答案
- OK, how can I help? - We need to find answers.

982
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,740
你最了解曼城卫士 他有没有什么藏身处 洞穴之类的? 
You knew Metro Man best. Did he have a hideout? A cave?

983
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,610
一个偏远的堡垒什么的 随便什么能给我们线索的东西
A solitary fortress of some kind? Anything that would give us clues.

984
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,410
嗯 我是知道一个地方
Well... there is one place I know.

985
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,650
是你赋予他力量的 你就不能再拿走吗
You gave him these powers. Can't you just take them away?

986
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:35,390
不能 那天我放错隐形车 丢了镭射枪
I can't. I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.

987
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,400
就是你甩了我的那天 一个人 还下着雨
The night you dumped me. Alone. In the rain.

988
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,000
你有没有回头过
Did you ever look back?

989
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,340
- 没有 - 我蓝色的大脑袋啊
- No! - My giant blue head!

990
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,630
我想我们到了
I guess we're here.

991
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,340
他就是把它藏在这里的
So, this is where he hid it.

992
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,880
过了这么多年了 我当年的校舍啊
After all these years. My old shoolhouse.

993
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,450
我为了那天晚上的事道歉
You know, I think there's an apology in order for the other night.

994
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,650
那太好了 不过快点
OK, that would be nice, but make it quick.

995
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,800
我们还得对付很多麻烦事呢
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.

996
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,360
哇 我没办法相信这些东西他都留着
Wow. I can't believe he kept all this stuff.

997
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,170
我还记得他穿着这些东西
I remember when he wore that.

998
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,830
- 我们是不是应该专心? - 是 当然的 要专心
- Shouldn't we try to stay focused here? - Yes, of course. Right. Focused.

999
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,010
嘿 过来看看这个
Hey. Come over and look at this.

1000
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,280
是什么 你发现什么了
What is it? What did you find?

1001
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,380
看
Look.

1002
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,380
这杯子里面有冰块
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1003
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,890
是啊 水冻了就会变成冰嘛
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.

1004
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,220
我 我的意思是 你不觉得奇怪吗
No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd

1005
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,590
这冰居然还没化
that the ice hasn't melted yet?

1006
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,430
生命的奥秘
One of life's great mysteries.

1007
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,300
嘿
Hey.

1008
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,880
我们已经证实了传言
We now have confirmed reports.

1009
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,790
太阳神本来以为他是这城市的英雄 现在变坏了
Titan, first thought to be this city's new hero, has turned evil.

1010
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,830
这城市从未经历如此的破坏
The city has never seen this level of destruction.

1011
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,930
万一曼城卫士还活着
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1012
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,930
- 你还活着 - 你还活着
- You're alive? - You're alive.

1013
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,870
- 我还活着 - 可是我 我们
- I'm alive. - But I, we...

1014
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,160
我们看到你的白骨了 你死了
We saw your skeleton! You were dead!

1015
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,310
你是鬼吗
Are you a ghost?

1016
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,770
你最好能给我们一个好一点的解释
There had better be an amazing explanation for this.

1017
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,910
说话吧 幽灵
Speak, apparition.

1018
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,680
好了 好了 好了 好了
OK. OK, OK, OK.

1019
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:45,550
你们都应该知道真相
You both deserve the truth.

1020
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,960
一切都从观象台说起
It all started back at the observatory.

1021
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,360
洛克斯安被绑架 我应该去解救她
Roxanne was kidnapped. I was gonna stop you.

1022
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,740
那天我脑子不太对劲
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1023
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,030
我那天就是应付事
We were kind of going through the motions.

1024
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,200
于是呢 我就利用我的速度
So... using my super- speed,

1025
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,570
我决定去安静安静
I decided to go clear my head.

1026
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,080
开炮! 
Fire!

1027
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:06,410
然后我意识到
Then I realized,

1028
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,520
我们一生都在玩这个傻乎乎的把戏
we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.

1029
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:14,150
我想去忽略我的感觉
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling,

1030
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,260
可心里就是堵得慌
but I just felt stuck.

1031
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:21,290
我忽然明白 除了我的超能力
I began to realize, despite all my powers,

1032
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:25,920
曼城每个市民都有个我所没有的东西 选择的权利
each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't: A choice.

1033
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:31,030
从我记事起 我只能成为这个城市所希望我去做的
Ever since I can remember, I've always had to be what the city wanted me to be.

1034
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,400
我想做的事情呢
But what about what I wanted to do?

1035
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,140
这想法忽然出现在我脑海里
Then it suddenly hit me.

1036
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,010
我是有选择的
I do have a choice.

1037
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,380
我可以做我想做的
I can be whatever I want to be.

1038
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,950
没人说过当英雄得是终身的
No one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig.

1039
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,180
可我也不能就那么退出
You can't just quit, either.

1040
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,190
于是 我就想到了这个绝妙的办法 假死
That's when I got the brilliant idea... to fake my death.

1041
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,560
铜会消耗我的能量
Copper drains my powers.

1042
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,670
你的弱点是铜? 
Your weakness is copper?

1043
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:04,630
被你的死亡光波击中的那一霎那 我觉得自己前所未有地活着
Once your death ray hit, I'd never felt so alive.

1044
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,900
我就从附近的护士学校借了个道具
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.

1045
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,410
曼城卫士终于死了
Metro Man was finally dead.

1046
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,740
而音乐卫士诞生了
And Music Man was born!

1047
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:15,180
- 音乐卫士? - 这样我就能留着我的标志了
- Music Man? - That way I could keep my logo.

1048
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,410
- 为什么? - 又来? 
- 'Cause of wha...? - Come again?

1049
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:20,110
我终于能接触我真正的能力...
I was finally free to get in touch with my true power...

1050
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,650
...将魔力赋予歌词
...weaving lyrical magic.

1051
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,050
听着
Check this out.

1052
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,290
我有一双眼睛
I have eyes that can see

1053
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,400
能穿透...
Right through lead...

1054
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,560
- 你太糟糕了! - 确实 你蛮有天赋
- You're horrible! - Granted, you have talent.

1055
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:37,430
可外面有个疯子 正毁了我们的... 你的城市
But there's a madman out there destroying our... your city.

1056
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,630
你怎么可以这样
How could you do this? !

1057
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,780
这个城市的市民那么相信你 你却抛弃了他们
The people of this city relied on you, and you deserted them!

1058
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,710
你害我们落入他的魔爪
You left us in the hands of him!

1059
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,250
- 无意冒犯 - 不 我和你站一边的
- No offense. - No, I'm with you.

1060
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,390
我们需要你的帮助
Look, we need your help.

1061
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,180
我很抱歉 我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry. I really am.

1062
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,850
我不干了
I'm done.

1063
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:00,520
小兄弟 你知道吗 有阳必有阴
You know, little buddy, there's a yin for every yang.

1064
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,790
有邪恶势力 正义势力就会奋起反抗
If there's bad, good will rise up against it.

1065
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,270
我花了很多时间才找到我自己的称号
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.

1066
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,940
现在是时候去找你自己的称号了
Now it's about time you find yours.

1067
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,040
嘿 谁需要他了
Hey, who needs him?

1068
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,900
我们自己就可以打败太阳神
We can beat Titan ourselves.

1069
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,050
我们可以回到邪恶老巢 带上些镭射枪
I say we go back to the evil lair, grab some ray guns,

1070
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,810
把他带到小巷里 叫上所有的黑帮往他身上招呼
hold him sideways, and just go all gangsta on him.

1071
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,020
我们不能
We can't.

1072
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,990
难道就这样了? 你就这么放弃了? 
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1073
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:35,190
我才是坏人 我不会拯救世界 然后飞向夕阳
I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day, I don't fly off into the sunset,

1074
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,960
抱得美人归的也不是我
and I don't get the girl.

1075
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:39,990
我要回家
I'm going home.

1076
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,430
除非马上有救星降临 否则一切都要毁了
Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost.

1077
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,930
成千上万人涌入城市 上演出埃及记
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.

1078
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:22,040
而留下的市民们 要记得在另行通知之前不要出门
Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice.

1079
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,270
当局已发出警告
Authorities have issued a warning

1080
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,780
无论如何都要待在市中心
to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.

1081
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,320
哈尔! 
Hal!

1082
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,700
哈尔! 
Hal!

1083
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,660
我猜猜 见识过我的厉害后
Let me guess. After seeing how awesome I am,

1084
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,170
你终于清醒了 好吧 我忘记你了
you've finally come to your senses? Well, I'm over you.

1085
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,540
- 我是来阻止你的 哈尔 - 就你? 好啊
- I've come to stop you, Hal. - You? Oh, wow.

1086
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,700
那你打算怎么做? 把我报道死? 
OK, what are you gonna do, report me to death?

1087
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,900
我要跟你讲道理
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1088
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,180
我们两个共事这么久 我了解你
You and I, we worked together for a long time. I know you.

1089
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,880
你不了解我 你从来不肯了解我
You don't know me. You never took the time to know me.

1090
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,390
这是我俩第一次正式约会
This is the first time we've hung out socially,

1091
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,390
也正是我要毁了这城市的时候
and it's when I'm about to destroy the city!

1092
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,290
我要跟真正的哈尔说话
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1093
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,730
那个热爱摄影师职业的
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman,

1094
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,300
有点耳背 有点呆呆的
and eating dip, and being a nerd,

1095
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,560
而且不像太阳神 哈尔的那个人
and being not as scary as the Tighten Hal.

1096
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,900
已经晚了
Too late!

1097
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,100
...打断了我们的计划...
...interrupting our scheduled...

1098
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:28,070
...发生极端的事件...
...extraordinary events taking place...

1099
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,010
打中了山谷...
Heat in the valley and...

1100
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:31,340
超级大坏蛋! 
Megamind!

1101
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,280
我俩有事没完
You and I have some unfinished business.

1102
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,010
我在曼城之塔等你
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower.

1103
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,620
还有 为了防止你打退堂鼓...
Oh, and just so you don't get cold feet...

1104
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,690
洛克斯安
Roxanne.

1105
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,490
来吧 洛丝 呼唤你的英雄 让他来救你
Come on, Roxie, call for your hero to come rescue you.

1106
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,370
超级大坏蛋 我不知道你有没有在听 如果你听到了
Megamind, I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are,

1107
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,800
你不能放弃
you can't give up.

1108
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:01,300
我所认识的超级大坏蛋可不会逃避
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight,

1109
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,000
哪怕他知道他绝对没有赢的机会
even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.

1110
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,650
这是你最美好的品质
It was your best quality.

1111
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,910
你要赶紧振作起来
You need to be that guy right now.

1112
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,250
这城市需要你
The city needs you.

1113
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,450
我需要你
I need you.

1114
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,720
洛克斯安
Roxanne.

1115
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,230
给你一个小时
You have one hour.

1116
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,730
不要让我等太久
Don't keep me waiting.

1117
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:29,560
典狱官 典狱官 听着 你得放我走
Warden! Warden! Listen to me! You have to let me go!

1118
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,700
必须有人阻止太阳神
Tighten has to be stopped!

1119
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,310
抱歉了超级大坏蛋 你还有88个无期徒刑要服
Sorry, Megamind. You still have 88 life sentences to go.

1120
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,640
够你反省的了
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.

1121
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:41,650
你真的要我说吗? 那我说好了
Did you want to hear me say it? I'll say it.

1122
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:45,320
听着 我从我心里最黑暗的地方说
Here it is, from the blackest part of my heart.

1123
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,020
对不起
I am sorry!

1124
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,360
我可不买帐
Not buying it.

1125
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,460
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

1126
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,800
我吓到这城市那么多次
I've terrorized this city countless times.

1127
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:06,530
还造出来一个其实是坏人的英雄
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.

1128
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,140
我还骗了洛克斯安 还有
I lied to Roxanne, and...

1129
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:15,110
...我最好的朋友小跟班 视他如草芥
...my best friend Minion, I treated like dirt.

1130
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:19,620
请你不要让这个城市...
Please don't make this city...

1131
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,150
...不要让洛克斯安 替我受罪
...don't make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings.

1132
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,950
接受你的道歉
Apology accepted.

1133
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:36,840
哦 小跟班 你个神奇的小鱼
Oh, Minion, you fantastic fish, you.

1134
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,940
我们还等什么呢 快走
What are we waiting for? We'd better get going.

1135
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,300
你还真骗倒我了
You got me.

1136
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,250
- 好运 伙计们 - 我们要死了
- Good luck, fellas! - We're gonna die!

1137
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,780
等等 你说什么
Wait, what?

1138
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,080
嘿 曼城的衰人们 我在曼城之塔
Hey, Metro losers. This is Metro Tower.

1139
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,390
人们说这是这城市力量的象征
They say it's supposed to be a symbol of our city's strength.

1140
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,620
对我来说 却总是让我回想起
But for me, it's a reminder of the day

1141
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:07,200
这个女人残忍的伤我的心的那天的伤心地 我讨厌伤心地
this woman ferociously ripped out my heart. And I hate reminders!

1142
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,770
救命
Help!

1143
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:27,610
请不要这样 我知道良心未泯 哈尔
Please don't do this. I know there's still good in you, Hal.

1144
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,280
你太天真了 洛丝
You're so naive, Roxie.

1145
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,430
你能看到所有人的优点 哪怕那人没优点
You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there.

1146
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,690
你活的太理想化
You're living a fantasy.

1147
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:38,090
复活节兔子 牙仙女什么的根本不存在
There is no Easter Bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy,

1148
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,100
根本没有英国女王这回事
and there is no Queen of England.

1149
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,270
这才是现实 你得醒醒了
This is the real world, and you need to wake up!

1150
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:59,250
你敢挑战超级大坏蛋吗? 
You dare challenge Megamind?

1151
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,480
这塔容不下两个超级大坏蛋
This town isn't big enough for two super- villains!

1152
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:07,290
哦 你的确是个坏蛋 但还不算超级大坏蛋
Oh, you're a villain all right! Just not a super one!

1153
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,360
是吗 有什么区别吗? 
Yeah? What's the difference?

1154
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:14,800
闪亮登场! 
Presentation!

1155
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,880
- 我知道你会回来的 - 哦 我也是这么想的
- I knew you'd come back. - Well, that made one of us.

1156
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:09,120
- 有什么计划吗? - 保命再说
- What's the plan? - Well, it mostly involves not dying.

1157
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,550
这计划不错
I like that plan.

1158
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,910
建筑物来了! 
Building!

1159
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,410
快点! 开快点! 
Go faster! Make this thing go faster!

1160
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,280
我控制不住! 
I can't control it!

1161
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,960
不
No.

1162
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,430
这也太简单了
Well, that was easy.

1163
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,900
还有一件事没完
Looks like there's only one loose end now.

1164
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:14,310
拜托 好歹尊重一下公共交通嘛
Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation.

1165
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,450
你回来了! 
You came back!

1166
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,750
你说对了洛克斯安 我不该离开的
You were right, Roxanne. I never should have left.

1167
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,220
我以为你死了
I... I thought you were dead.

1168
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,630
我的死亡是... 夸大了的
My death was... greatly exaggerated.

1169
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,560
你就是传说中的那个阿飞啊
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1170
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,550
抱歉 我尽力了
I'm sorry. I did the best I could.

1171
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,050
我为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1172
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,320
小跟班? 
Minion?

1173
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,990
惊喜吧! 
Surprise!

1174
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,060
他才是真正的英雄
He's the real hero.

1175
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,270
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

1176
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,570
你去哪? 
Going somewhere?

1177
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,610
除了监狱? 
Besides jail?

1178
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,620
不 别打脸 哥们 拜托
No, not in the face, man. Please.

1179
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:26,230
你知道应该怎么办 太阳神 离开蛮城! 
If you know what's good for you, Tighten, you'll stay out of Metrocity!

1180
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,830
- 明白了! - 永远地
- You got it! - For good!

1181
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,960
你也太卑鄙了吧 姐
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1182
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:08,260
管这个小镇叫"蛮城"的只有你了
But there's only one person I know who calls this town "Metrocity."

1183
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,440
就你
You.

1184
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,870
我猜你觉得这挺好玩的? 
Bet you think it's really funny?

1185
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,340
大家都在嘲笑一下这帅哥? 
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy?

1186
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,320
你嚣张不了多久的
Well, you're not gonna be laughing for long.

1187
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,490
隐形车
The invisible car.

1188
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,650
喂 记得我甩你的那天晚上吗
Hey! Remember that night that I dumped you?

1189
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,190
你现在提这事? 
You're bringing this up now?

1190
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,560
我那天有回头的! 
Well, I did look back!

1191
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,890
你回头了? 你真的回头了? 
You did? You did?

1192
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:42,560
是啊 现在该你回头看看了
Yes! And you should look back right now!

1193
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,460
哦 我懂了
Oh, I get it!

1194
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,910
这是你最后一次耍我了
This is the last time you make a fool out of me!

1195
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,350
我把你造成了英雄
I made you a hero.

1196
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,580
干傻事的是你自己
You did the fool thing all by yourself.

1197
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,360
你太可悲了
You're so pathetic.

1198
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:14,130
不管你站在哪边 你总是败者
No matter what side you're on, you're always the loser.

1199
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,430
当败者是有好处的
There's a benefit to losing.

1200
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,870
你可以从失败中吸取教训
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1201
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:25,780
哦 你别逗我了
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1202
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,210
小跟班 我要是活下来 我非杀了你不可
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1203
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,490
好好飞吧
Enjoy your flight!

1204
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,150
超级大坏蛋! 
Megamind!

1205
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,000
故事就是这么结束的
So this is how it ends.

1206
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:58,300
一般 我会把它载入我光辉失败史的最后一页
Normally, I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.

1207
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,380
但今天不行
But not today.

1208
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,490
我还能说什么呢? 恶习难改
What can I say? Old habits die hard.

1209
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,120
说再见吧 洛丝
Say bye- bye, Roxie.

1210
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,830
喔罗
OIIo.

1211
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:33,170
坏人呢 总是输的
The thing about bad guys, they always lose!

1212
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,220
- 你做到了 你赢了 - 是啊...
- You did it. You won. - Well...

1213
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,810
我终于找到了赢的理由 就是你
I finally had a reason to win. You.

1214
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,060
小跟班! 
Minion!

1215
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:59,340
我看不见了 忽冷忽热 忽明忽暗的
Can't see. It's cold and... warm, and dark and light.

1216
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:01,530
是我 小跟班 我在这
It's me, Minion. I'm right here.

1217
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,770
我们两个一起经历这么多
We've had a lot of adventures together, you and I.

1218
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,540
是啊 小跟班
We have, Minion.

1219
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:13,340
我说 大多数都以失败收场
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure,

1220
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,050
可我们今天没输 是吧 先生
but we won today. Didn't we, sir?

1221
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:21,890
是啊 小跟班 我们做到了 谢谢你
Yes, Minion, we did it. Thanks to you.

1222
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:26,330
暗号 我们现在是好人了
Code: We're The Good Guys Now.

1223
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:29,270
暗号 我想是的
Code: I Guess We Are.

1224
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,510
哦 哦 哦 我要死了 我想 我快要死了
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going! I think this, this is it!

1225
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,630
我要到那 遥远的...
I'm going... going far...

1226
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,510
真是爱演戏啊
What a drama queen.

1227
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:52,580
我现在觉得好多了 我想我只是需要游个泳而已
You know, I'm feeling much better now. I guess I just needed a swim.

1228
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,320
他真吓到你了 是吧
He had you, didn't he?

1229
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,590
小跟班的老把戏 别对我做这表情
Classic Minion. Don't give me that face.

1230
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,320
他就是靠那张小脸骗人的
He reels you in with that little face.

1231
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,330
- 看他那张老脸 - 我们做到了
- Look at that face. - We did it!

1232
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,130
我们做到了
We did it!

1233
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,030
- 拳头泵! - 你做到了
- Fist pump! - You did it!

1234
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:05,760
我们赢了 我们赢了 我们赢了
We won, we won, we won!

1235
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,780
回去吧 你个野蛮人
Get back, you savages!

1236
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:14,110
抱歉 抱歉 他不太习惯人们积极的反应
Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.

1237
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:21,180
有趣 我觉得命运不是给我们的...
Funny, I guess destiny is not the path given to us...

1238
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:27,120
...而是我们自己选择的
...but the path we choose for ourselves.

1239
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,640
好了 把手抬起来
All right, put your hands in the air.

1240
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,370
钱包交出来
Now hand over your wallets.

1241
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,300
我开玩笑啦
I'm just kidding!

1242
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,540
开玩笑
Just kidding!

1243
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,950
我不得不承认 当好人是有好处的
I have to admit, being good has its perks.

1244
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:55,880
知道吗 你穿白色很帅
You know, you look pretty good in white.

1245
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,290
超级大坏蛋 麻烦你...
Megamind, if you plea...

1246
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:05,630
喂 你挡着我孩子了
Hey. My kid can't see.

1247
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,670
抱歉 朋友
Sorry, my friend.

1248
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,630
你还有很长的路要走 我知道你
Way to go, little buddy. I knew he had it in him.

1249
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:13,770
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1250
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:18,000

1252
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,510

Hit it!

1253
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,650
超级大坏蛋! 超级大坏蛋! 超级大坏蛋! 超级大坏蛋! 
Megamind! Megamind! Megamind! Megamind!

1254
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,570
我是坏人 我是坏人 没错 耶
I'm bad! I'm bad! That's right. Yeah!

1255
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,200
先生 你真得多清清你的口袋了
Sir, you really need to empty your pockets more often.

1256
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,610
这是我一生里最糟糕的一天
This has been the worst day of my entire life.

1257
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,300
别着急
No worries.
