7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,390
这是一个讲述我死亡的故事
This is the story of how I died.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,180
别紧张  其实这是个很有趣的故事
Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,180
通缉  福林?莱德  小偷

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,030
更确切地说  我并不是主角
And the truth is, it isn't even mine.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,580
主角是一个名叫瑞普兹的女孩
This is the story of a girl named, Rapunzel.

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,030
故事要从太阳讲起
And it starts, with the sun.

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,270
很久很久以前
Now, once upon a time,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,500
天空坠落了一抹阳光
a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,040
在这抹阳光中  
And from this small drop of sun,

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,210
开出了一株金色的仙花
grew a magic, golden, flower.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,540
它能治愈百病  抚平创伤
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,650
看到那边的老婆婆了吗
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?

19
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,560
你最好记住她
You might want to remember her.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,350
她算是个关键人物
She's kind of important.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,090
几个世纪过去了
Well, centuries pass

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,020
在那不远的山水间  崛起了一个王国
and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.

23
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,380
受人爱戴的国王和皇后统治着这片土地
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,520
皇后就快分娩了
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby,

25
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,000
可是她病了
but she got sick,

26
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,800
病得很重
really, sick.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,240
她已命在旦夕
She was running out of time.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,740
这时  人们通常期盼着奇迹的降临
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,290
而这个故事里  期盼的是那朵金色的仙花
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,860
早说了她很重要吧
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,170
这个女巫格特尔
You see instead of sharing the suns gift,

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,000
并没有和别人分享这太阳的馈赠  
this woman, Mother Gothel,

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,250
而是独占了它的治愈能力
hoarded its healing power

34
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,160
让自己永葆青春容颜
and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,240
她要做的只是唱一首特别的歌
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,020
仙花闪耀  
Flower gleam and glow,

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,210
魔力显现
let your power shine

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,360
倒转时光  
Make the clock reverse,

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,510
带回往昔美好
bring back what once was mine.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,220
带回往昔美好
What once was mine.

41
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,180
现在明白了吧  
All right, you get the jist.

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,230
她一唱歌就变年轻了  很恐怖吧
She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,490
找到了
We've found it!

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,600
仙花的魔力治愈了皇后
The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.

45
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,500
一个健康的小公主诞生了
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,600
她有一头美丽的金发
With beautiful golden hair.

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,240
提醒一下
I'll give you a hint.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,020
她就是瑞普兹
That's Rapunzel.

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,970
为了庆祝公主降生
To celebrate her birth,

50
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,580
国王和皇后放飞了一盏天灯
the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,360
那一刻  一切都那么完美
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.

52
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,130
然而美好的时光戛然而止
And then that moment ended.

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,990
仙花闪耀  
Flower, gleam and glow,

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,660
魔力显现
let your powers shine

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,940
倒转时光
Make the clock re... Huh!

56
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,700
格特尔闯进了城堡
Gothel broke into the castle,

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,550
偷走了公主  就这样  消失了
stole the child, and just like that... gone.

58
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,280
全国上下苦苦寻找公主
The Kingdom searched and searched,

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,160
却怎么也找不到
but they could not find the Princess.

60
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,030
而在密林深处
For deep within the forest

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,560
一座隐秘的高塔里
In a hidden tower.

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
格特尔待这个孩子视如己出
Gothel raised the child as her own.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,040
返还吾之所失
... save what has been lost,

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,770
带回往昔美好  
bring back what once was mine,

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,750
往昔美好
what once was mine.

66
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,440
格特尔的仙花失而复得
Gothel had found her new magic flower.

67
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,790
这次她决定让它永不见天日
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.

68
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,600
为什么我不能出门
Why can't I go outside?

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,670
外面的世界很危险
The outside world is a dangerous place.

70
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,030
到处都是恐怖自私的人
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

71
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,030
你必须待在这里  这里最安全
You must stay here, where you're safe.

72
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,040
-明白吗  小花  -明白了  妈妈 
- Do you understand, flower? - Yes, Mommy.

73
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,370
但这塔的高墙  并非密不透风
But the walls of that tower, could not hide everything.

74
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,700
每年在她生日那天
Each year on her birthday,

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,140
国王和皇后都会放飞成千上万盏天灯
the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky.

76
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,520
希望有一天  
In hope that one day,

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,920
失踪的公主会回到身边
their lost Princess, would return.

78
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,870
那我猜帕斯卡没躲在这儿
Well I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.

79
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,470
找到你了
Gotcha!

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,690
第二十二次胜利
That's twenty two for me.

81
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,310
要不要改写成四十五局二十三胜
How about twenty three, out of forty five?

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,740
好吧  那你想玩什么
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

83
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,560
这可不行
Yeah, I don't think so.

84
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,420
我喜欢待家里  你也是
I like it in here and so do you.

85
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,830
别这样  帕斯卡  这里其实不错
Oh, come on Pascal, it's not so bad in there.

86
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,200
{\pos(180,240)}魔 发 奇 缘

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,920
早晨七点  又是平凡的一天
7a.m. The usual morning line-up

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,140
琐碎家务  先扫净地板
Start on the chores I sweep 'til the floors all clean.

89
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,990
抛光打蜡  洗衣拖地  洗洗刷刷
Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up.

90
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,880
再扫一次  也才七点十五
Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.

91
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,200
读一二三本书
So I'll read a book, or maybe two or three.

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,910
画四五六幅画
I’ll add a few new paintings to my gallery.

93
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,330
弹吉他  做针线  烹饪煮饭
I'll play guitar, and knit, and cook and basically.

94
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,370
可我的精彩人生何时开始
Just wonder when will my life, begin.

95
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,810
午饭后  玩拼图  投飞镖  烤蛋糕
Then after lunch, it's puzzles, and darts and baking.

96
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,330
做纸工  跳芭蕾  下象棋
Papier-mache, a bit of ballet, and chess.

97
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,550
制陶器  学腹语  做蜡烛  
Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.

98
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,940
然后伸个懒腰  画个草图  
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,060
爬个房梁  织条裙子  
Take a climb, sew a dress,

100
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,040
再把书重读一遍
and I'll re-read the books.

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,540
若还有时间  我要再画些图
If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall some more,

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,530
墙上肯定还有空
I'm sure there's room somewhere.

103
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,620
然后我把头发一点一点慢慢梳
And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush, and brush my hair.

104
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,920
永远待在老地方
Stuck in the same place I've always been.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,940
我不停好奇  疑惑  幻想
And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering...

106
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,190
我的精彩人生何时开始
Wondering, when will my life begin?

107
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:13,060
明晚  灯光又将闪亮
Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.

108
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:22,100
一如每年生日闪耀的夜空
Just like they do on my birthday, each year.

109
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:32,450
灯光闪耀的地方究竟什么样
What is it like, out there where they glow?

110
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:41,360
如今我已长大  也许妈妈会放手
Now that I'm older. Mother might just let me go.

111
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,970
真想天天看到这美景
I could get used to a view like this.

112
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,440
-莱德  快  -等等
- Rider, come on. - Hold on.

113
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,290
好吧  我爱上这景色了  
Yep, I'm used to it.

114
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,020
哥儿们  我要一座城堡
Guys I want a castle.

115
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,600
干这行  总有一天你能买下一座城堡
We do this job, you could buy your own castle.

116
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,750
是花粉症吧
Oh, hay fever?

117
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,820
是啊
Yeah.

118
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,930
等等  别跑
Wait, wait. Hey, wait!

119
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,540
很难想象我住在自己的城堡里吗
Can't you picture me in a castle of my own?

120
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,290
我肯定能做到
'Cause I certainly can.

121
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,820
才早上八点  我们就得了这么大一笔
Oh, the things we've seen and it's only eight in the morning.

122
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,480
伙计们  今天可是个好日子
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

123

好了  今天是个大日子  帕斯卡
This is it. This is a very big day, Pascal.

124
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,770
我终于决定了
I'm finally going to do it.

125
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,560
-我要去问问她  -瑞普兹
- I'm going to ask her. - Rapunzel!

126
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,030
放下你的头发来
Let down your hair.

127
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,370
是时候了
It's time.

128
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,910
我知道  好了  别让她看见你
I know, I know. Come on, don't let her see you.

129
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,290
瑞普兹  我可不会在下面越活越年轻啊
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.

130
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,160
来了  妈妈
Coming, mother.

131
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,350
欢迎回家  妈妈
Hi, welcome home, mother.

132
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,100
瑞普兹  你怎么做到每天拉我上来
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do that every single day,

133
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,140
还从不失误呢  看起来太累人了  亲爱的
without fail, it looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

134
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,370
这没什么
Oh, it's nothing.

135
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,420
那这次怎么耽误这么久
Then I don't know why it takes so long.

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,430
亲爱的  我就是开个玩笑
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

137
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,950
好吧  妈妈  
All right... so, mother.

138
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,450
你知道的  明天是个大日子
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

139
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,570
瑞普兹快看镜子  知道我看见什么了吗
Rapunzel look in that mirror. You know what I see?

140
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,010
一位坚强  自信的美少女
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.

141
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,610
看  你也在镜子里
Oh look, you're here too.

142
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,800
开玩笑的  认真你就输了
I'm just teasing, stop taking everything so seriously.

143
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,930
妈妈  我正想说  明天...
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...

144
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,720
瑞普兹  你妈妈觉得有点不那么年轻了
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.

145
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,060
给我唱首歌好吗  亲爱的
Would you sing for me, dear?

146
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,730
-然后再说正事  -当然  妈妈
- Then we'll talk. - OH! Of course, mother.

147
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,830
仙花闪耀  魔力显现
Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine,

148
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,710
倒转时光  带回往昔美好
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.

149
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,550
抚平创伤  改变命运
Heal what has been hurt, change the fate's design.

150
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,580
返还吾之所失  带回往昔美好
Save what has been lost, bring back what once was mine.

151
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,610
-瑞普兹  -那么  妈妈
- Rapunzel! - So, mother,

152
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,860
之前我想说  
earlier I was saying that tomorrow

153
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,760
明天是个大日子  你还没回话呢
was a pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

154
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,000
我就是想告诉你  明天是我生日
So I'm just going to tell you. It's my birthday!

155
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,900
不  不可能
No, no, no can't be.

156
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,980
我记得很清楚  你的生日是去年
I distinctly remember. Your birthday was last year.

157
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,820
这就是生日有意思的地方
That's the funny thing about birthdays.

158
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,340
一年一次
They're kind of an annual thing.

159
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,080
妈妈  我马上就满十八岁了
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

160
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,880
我想要  这个生日我最想要的
And I wanted to ask, what I really want for this birthday.

161
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,930
实际上我想要
Actually what I want for...

162
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,610
瑞普兹拜托  别含含糊糊的
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

163
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,650
你知道我很讨厌说话含糊
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

164
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,740
什么也听不清  太讨厌了
Blah, blah, blah... blah. It's very annoying.

165
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,020
开玩笑的  你这么可爱  
I'm just teasing, you're adorable

166
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,290
我爱你还来不及呢  亲爱的
I love you so much, darling.

167
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,080
我想去看那会飞的灯
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

168
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,730
看什么  
What?

169
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,400
我希望你能带我去看会飞的灯
Well I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights.

170
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,660
你是说星星
Oh, you mean the stars.

171
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,450
不是这样的
That's the thing.

172
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,810
我画过天文图  星星是恒定不动的
I've charted stars and they're always constant.

173
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,940
但那些灯  
But these,

174
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,770
出现在每年我生日的那天  妈妈
they appear every year on my birthday, Mother.

175
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,800
只此一天
Only on my birthday.

176
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,590
我总忍不住想  
And I can't help but feel that they're,

177
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,860
它们是因我而在的
they're meant for me.

178
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,590
我要看看  妈妈  不仅是透过窗户 
I need see them, mother. And not just from my window.

179
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,090
我要亲眼看看
In person.

180
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,970
我一定要知道那是什么
I have to know what they are.

181
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,210
你想出去吗
You want to go outside?

182
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,440
为什么  瑞普兹
Oh, why Rapunzel.

183
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,790
看看你  娇嫩如花
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.

184
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,660
脆弱如芽
Still a little sapling, just a sprout.

185
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,440
你知道为何要待在这高塔  
You know why we stay up in this tower.

186
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,030
我知道  可是
I know, but...

187
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,870
没错  我要让你健健康康  安然无恙
That's right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.

188
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,690
我知道总有这一天
Guess I always knew this day was coming.

189
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,640
你会想远走高飞
Know that soon you'd want to leave the nest.

190
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,030
-快了  但时辰还未到  -可是
- Soon, but not yet. Shhh.. - But

191
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:49,100
相信我  小家伙  妈妈最清楚
Trust me pet, Mother, knows best.

192
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,360
妈妈最清楚
Mother knows best,

193
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,130
听妈妈的话
listen to your mother.

194
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,680
外面的世界很可怕
It's a scary world out there.

195
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,590
妈妈最清楚
Mother knows best.

196
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,460
出门在外  麻烦总难免
One way or another, something will go wrong, I swear.

197
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,480
流氓恶棍  毒藤流沙
Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy, quicksand.

198
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
食人族  毒蛇 瘟疫也会来
Cannibals, and snakes, the plague... yes.

199
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,730
还有恐怖巨虫  獠牙怪胎
Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.

200
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,610
不说了  想想就心寒
And stop, no more, you'll just upset me.

201
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,280
妈妈会在这儿  给你保护
Mother's right here, mother will protect you.

202
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,920
所以宝贝听我一句
Darling here's what I suggest.

203
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,270
别瞎想  待在妈妈身边
Skip the drama, stay with Mama.

204
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,990
妈妈最清楚
Mother, knows best.

205
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,980
妈妈最清楚  没有庇护
Mother knows best. Take it from your mumsey.

206
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,250
你一个人难以生存
On your own, you won't survive.

207
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,930
衣着简陋  幼稚笨拙  
Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,

208
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,300
你会被别人生吞活剥
Please, they'll eat you up, alive.

209
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,180
很傻很天真
Gullible, naive, positively grubby.

210
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,120
很呆很无知
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague.

211
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,150
再加上一点婴儿肥
Plus I believe, getting kinda chubby.

212
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,970
我这么说只是因为我爱你
I'm just saying, 'Cause I luv you.

213
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,920
妈妈懂你  妈妈会在一旁帮助你
Mother understands, Mothers here to help you.

214
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,590
我只有一事相求
All I have is one request.

215
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,280
-瑞普兹  -在
- Rapunzel? - Yes?

216
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,520
永远别再提要离开这座塔的事
Don't ever ask to leave this tower, again.

217
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,560
好的  妈妈
Yes, Mother.

218
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,720
我很爱你  亲爱的
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.

219
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,820
我更爱你
I love you more.

220
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,610
天底下我最爱你
I love you most.

221
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,590
别忘了
Don't forget it.

222
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,640
不然你会后悔
You'll regret it.

223
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
妈妈
Motherrrrrrr.

224
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,060
最清楚
Knows best.

225
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,680
一会儿见  我的小花
Ta, ta, I'll see you in a bit, my flower.

226
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,810
我一直都在
I'll be here.

227
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,360
遭了糟了  太遭了
No, no no. This is bad, this is very,

228
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,480
糟糕透顶
very bad, This is really bad.

229
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,960
他们总画不对我的鼻子
They just can't get my nose right.

230
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,640
管他呢
Who cares.

231
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,180
你们倒是站着说话不腰疼
Well it's easy for you to say.

232
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,290
你们俩都帅翻了
You guys look amazing.

233
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,480
这样  你们先推我上去  我再来拉你们
All right, okay. Give me a boost, and I'll pull you up.

234
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,310
先把包给我们
Give us the satchel first.

235
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,890
什么  我就是
Wha..? I just...

236
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,730
真不敢相信  我们在一起混了这么久
I can't believe, that after all we've been through together,

237
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,190
你们还是不信任我
you don't trust me.

238
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,140
现在把我们拉上去吧  小白脸
Now help us up, pretty boy.

239
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,050
不好意思  腾不出手了
Sorry, my hands are full.

240
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,180
什么
What?

241
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,050
莱德
Rider!

242
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,680
无论如何也要把背包夺回来  
Retrieve that satchel with any force.

243
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,500
遵命  长官
Yes, sir!

244
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,390
我们就快抓住他了  马克西姆斯
We got him now, Maximus.

245
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,430
快走啊  蠢货
Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.

246
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,840
不行
No.

247
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,350
别咬了
No, stop it.

248
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,520
别乱来
Stop it.

249
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
给我
Give it to me.

250
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,890
总算清净了
Alone at last.

251
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,670
淡定  有个人在我衣橱里
Okay, okay, I got a person in my closet.

252
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,840
我衣橱里有个人
I've got a person in my closet.

253
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,320
我把一个人扔衣橱里了
I've got a person in my closet!

254
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,600
我还弱不禁风  不能自理吗  妈妈
To weak to handle myself out there, huh Mother?

255
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,060
问问我的平底锅吧
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.

256
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,540
瑞普兹
Rapunzel!

257
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,450
放下你的头发来
Let down your hair.

258
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,120
等一下  妈妈
One moment, Mother.

259
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,310
我有个大惊喜
I have a big surprise.

260
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,580
我也是
Uh, I do too.

261
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,260
打赌我的这个更惊喜
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

262
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,730
那可不一定
I seriously doubt it.

263
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,830
我采来了防风草
I brought back parsnips.

264
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,670
晚饭给你做榛子汤  你的最爱
I'm going to make hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

265
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,890
惊喜吧
Surprise!

266
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,580
妈妈  我想跟你说个事儿
Well mother, there's something I want to tell you.

267
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,980
瑞普兹  你知道我并不想吵完就一走了之
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.

268
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,930
尤其是错还不在我
Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

269
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,050
我一直在想你之前说的话
Okay, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, earlier.

270
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,110
但愿你别还在讲星星的事
I hope you're not still talking about the stars.

271
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,740
会飞的灯  没错  我一会儿会讲到这个
Floating lights, and yes I'm leading up to that.

272
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,040
我以为这事已经没什么好说的了  宝贝
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

273
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,020
不  妈妈  我是想说
No Mother, I'm just saying,

274
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,900
你觉得我太弱小  不能在外照顾自己
you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.

275
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,110
亲爱的  
Oh darling, I know you're

276
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,940
这点毋庸置疑
not strong enough to handle yourself out there.

277
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,900
但你只要...  
But if you just...

278
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,630
瑞普兹  别再提这事了
Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

279
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,480
-相信我  -瑞普兹
- Trust me... - Rapunzel.

280
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,770
-我清楚我能做什么  -瑞普兹
- ...I know what I'm - Rapunzel.

281
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,510
求你了  
Oh, come on.

282
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,480
够了  别再提那灯了  瑞普兹
Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.

283
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,020
你别想离开这个塔  永远别想
You are not leaving this tower, ever!

284
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,500
好极了  这下我成坏人了
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

285
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,450
其实我想说  妈妈...
All I was gonna say, mother is that...

286
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,750
我知道我生日想要什么了
I know what I want for my birthday, now.

287
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,500
想要什么
And what is that?

288
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,930
一套新的颜料  就是上次你带给我
New paint. That paint made from the white shells

289
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,870
用白贝壳做的那种
you once brought me.

290
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,980
那得去好远  瑞普兹
Well that is a very long trip, Rapunzel.

291
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,870
得三天时间
Almost three day's time.

292
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,920
我以为这比看星星的主意要好些
I just thought it was a better idea than, uh, stars.

293
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,780
你确定能照顾好自己吗
You sure you'll be all right, on your own?

294
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,130
我知道只要在这儿我就是安全的
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.

295
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,830
我三天内就会回来
I'll be back in three days time.

296
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,140
宝贝  我很爱你
I love you very much, dear.

297
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,090
我更爱你
I love you more.

298
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,640
天底下我最爱你
I love you most.

299
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,310
好吧
Okay.

300
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,860
这是...头发吗
Is this... hair?

301
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,480
挣扎  挣扎是没用的
Struggling... struggling is pointless.

302
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,630
我知道你为什么在这里
I know why you're here.

303
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,350
但是我不怕你
And I'm not afraid of you.

304
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,870
什么
What?

305
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,440
你是谁  你是怎么找到我的
Who are you, and how did you find me?

306
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,960
你是谁  你是怎么找到我的
Who are you, and how did you find me?

307
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,760
我不知道你是谁
I know not who you are.

308
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,920
也不知道怎么找到你的
Nor how I came to find you.

309
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,860
但是请容我说一句
But may I just say.

310
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,100
嗨
Hi!

311
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,750
你好吗
How you doing?

312
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,250
我是福林?莱德
The name's Flynn Rider.

313
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,130
你过得好吗
How's your day going, huh?

314
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,020
还有谁知道我在这  福林?莱德
Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?

315
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,570
-行了  美女  -瑞普兹
- All right, Blondie. - Rapunzel.

316
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,720
放轻松  是这样的
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

317
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,510
我遇到了点麻烦  在森林里闲逛
I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest.

318
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,670
无意间逛到了你的塔前...
I came across your tower and...

319
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,030
哦  不  我的包呢
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

320
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,570
我藏起来了  一个你永远也找不到的地方
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll never find it.

321
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,160
在那壶里  对吧
It's in that pot, isn't it.

322
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,080
你能别这样吗
Will you stop that.

323
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,810
现在藏得你永远也找不到了
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

324
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,140
那么  你想对我的头发做什么
So, what do you want with my hair?

325
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,380
-想剪我头发吗  -什么
- To cut it? - What?

326
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,040
-卖我的头发吗  -不啊
- Sell it? - No!

327
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,960
听着  我唯一想对你头发做的事就是
Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair,

328
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,740
挣脱它  就这么简单
is to get out of it. Literally.

329
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,210
等等  你不想要我的头发
Wait, you don't want my hair?

330
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,190
我究竟为什么要你的头发
Why on earth would I want your hair?

331
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,490
听着  我当时正被人追着
Look, I was being chased,

332
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,670
我看见一座塔  我就爬上来了  没了
I saw a tower, I climbed it, end of story.

333
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,690
你说的是真的吗
You're telling the truth?

334
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,140
是啊
Yes.

335
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,730
我知道  我需要有人带我出去
I know, I need someone to take me.

336
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,110
我也觉得他说的是实话
I think he's telling the truth, too.

337
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,000
没有獠牙不像坏人  我该怎么办
Doesn't have fangs, but what choice do I have?

338
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,600
好吧  福林?莱德  
Uh, okay Flynn Rider,

339
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,180
我准备和你做个交易
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

340
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,850
-交易  -往这看
- Deal? - Look this way.

341
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,000
你知道这些是什么吗
Do you know what these are?

342
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,310
你是说为公主点亮的天灯吗
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?

343
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,180
天灯
Lanterns...

344
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,330
我就知道这些不是星星
I knew they weren't stars.

345
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,810
明晚他们将用这些天灯
Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky,

346
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,670
点亮夜空  
with these lanterns.

347
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,850
你做我的向导
You will act as my guide,

348
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,460
带我去看天灯  然后安全地送我回来
take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely.

349
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,740
之后  只有这样  我才会把包还你  
Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you.

350
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,930
这就是我的交易
That is my deal.

351
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,640
不可能
Yeah, no can do.

352
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,490
不凑巧的是  这会儿我在这国家其实
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I aren't exactly, simpatico,

353
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,780
不太受欢迎  所以我不会带你去任何地方
at the moment. So I won't be taking you anywhere.

354
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,990
冥冥中你来到了这里  福林?莱德
Something brought you here, Flynn Rider.

355
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,180
-随你说是宿命或是定数  -是一匹马 
- Call it what you will, fate, destiny. - A horse.

356
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,790
所以我决定相信你
So I have made the decision to trust you.

357
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,120
着实糟糕的决定
A horrible decision, really.

358
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,490
相信我  我告诉你
But trust me, when I tell you this.

359
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,600
虽然你能一块砖一块砖地拆了这塔
You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick.

360
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,010
但是没我的帮助  你永远也找不到你的包
But without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.

361
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,980
让我理一理思路
Let me just get this straight.

362
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,870
我带你去看天灯
I take you to see the lanterns.

363
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,170
然后送你回来
Bring you back home,

364
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,340
你就会把包还给我吗
and you'll give me back my satchel?

365
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,600
我保证
I promise.

366
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,380
我一旦许下诺言  就绝不食言
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.

367
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,220
绝不
Ever!

368
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,040
好吧  听着  我并不想这样
All right, listen, I didn't want to have to want to do this,

369
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,640
但你让我别无选择
but you leave me no choice.

370
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,050
让我先酝酿一下
Here comes the 'smolder'.

371
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,610
看来我今天得放假了
This is kind of an off day for me.

372
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,390
这不正常
This doesn't normally happen.

373
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,980
好吧  我带你去看天灯
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

374
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,480
真的吗
Really!

375
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,890
你坏了我的情绪
You broke my 'smolder'.

376
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,700
你不下来吗  美女
You coming, Blondie?

377
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,220
看外面的世界  咫尺之遥  
Look at the world so close,

378
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,910
我就要来到
and I'm half way to it.

379
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,910
放眼望去  世界之大  
Look at it all so big

380
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,160
我却不敢跨出一步
do I even dare?

381
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,090
看看自己  只需踏出最后一步
Look at me, here at last I just have to do it.

382
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,120
我该留下吗  不
Should I? No.

383
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,880
我这就下去
Here I go.

384
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,080
呼吸青草泥土香  
Just smell the grass, the dirt.

385
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,410
正似我所梦
Just like I dreamed they'd be.

386
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,620
感受夏日和风徐徐
Just feel that summer breeze.

387
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,830
正是世界向我召唤
The way it's calling me.

388
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,810
生平第一次  我终于完全自由
For like the first time ever, I'm completely free.

389
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,740
我可以随心奔跑  疾走  起舞
I could go running, and racing, and dancing...

390
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,610
随意追逐  跑跳  跨越
and chasing, and leaping and bounding.

391
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,370
头发飘舞  心跳怦怦  
Hair flying, heart pounding

392
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,920
水珠飞溅  天旋地转
and splashing and reeling.

393
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,270
终于感知
And finally feeling,

394
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:22,640
正如我生命的开始
that's when my life begins.

395
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,660
真不敢相信我做到了
I can't believe I did this.

396
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,600
真不敢相信我做到了  
I can't believe I did this.

397
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,690
真不敢相信我做到了
I can't believe I did this!

398
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,950
妈妈肯定会气疯的
Mother would be so furious.

399
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,940
没事的  她不知道就没事  对吧
That's okay, what she doesn't know won't kill her, right?

400
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,750
我的天  她会担心死的
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

401
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,090
这里太好玩了
This is so fun!

402
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,730
我是个坏女儿  我得回去
I am a horrible daughter, I'm going back.

403
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,380
我再也不要回去啦
I am never going baaaccckkk!

404
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,380
我是个卑鄙的人
I am a despicable human being.

405
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,040
人生中最美好的一天
Best day, ever!

406
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,670
我没办法不注意
You know, I can't help but notice,

407
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,960
你似乎内心很矛盾
you seem a little at war with yourself, here.

408
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,410
-什么  -当然我就零碎地听到一些
- What? - Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces,

409
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,820
保护过度的母亲  禁止出门
of course, over protective mother, forbidden road trip.

410
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,410
这的确是很严重的问题
I mean, this is serious stuff.

411
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,320
我来让你放轻松些
But let me ease your conscious.

412
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,050
这是成长的必经之路
This is part of growing up.

413
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,170
一点小叛逆  一点小冒险
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

414
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,110
都挺正常  甚至有利于健康成长
That's good, healthy even.

415
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,110
你这么想的
You think?

416
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,090
当然  你一路上都想得太多了
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me.

417
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,250
你妈妈该容忍你出走吗  不能
Does your mother deserve it? No.

418
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,750
这会让她伤心欲绝吗
Will this break her heart and crush her soul?

419
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,760
当然会  但是你必须坚持
Of course. But you just got to do it.

420
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,160
伤心吗
Break her heart?

421
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,360
-对一半  -欲绝吗
- In half. - Crush her soul?

422
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,260
就像这颗葡萄
Like a grape.

423
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,050
她会很伤心的  你说得对
She would be heart broken, you're right.

424
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,960
我是对的  唉  真烦
I am, oh my, oh bother.

425
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,560
好吧  不敢相信我会这么说  但是
All right, I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

426
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,210
我同意你终止交易
I'm letting you out of the deal.

427
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,040
-什么  -没错
- What? - That's right.

428
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,630
不过别谢我  我们调个头
But don't thank me. Let's just turn around,

429
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,380
回你家去  拿上你的锅和青蛙
and get you home, here's your pan and your frog.

430
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,140
我拿回我的包
I get back my satchel.

431
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,240
你找回一段彼此信任
You get back a mother daughter relationship

432
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,280
美好的母女关系
based on mutual trust and viola!

433
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,390
而我们像陌生人一样就此别过
We part ways as unlikely friends.

434
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,890
-不  我要去看天灯  -够了
- No, I am seeing those lanterns. - Oh, come on!

435
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,770
到底要怎样才能拿回我的包啊
What is it going to take to get my satchel back?

436
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,850
我会用这个
I will use this.

437
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,250
是流氓  恶棍吗  是来抓我的吗
Is it, ruffians, thugs? Have they come for me?

438
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,180
冷静  它可嗅得到你的恐惧
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

439
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,880
不好意思
Oh, sorry.

440
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,940
我好像有点反应过度了
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

441
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,880
不过  要能避开恶棍  流氓就最好了
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though.

442
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,330
恩  的确是这样
Yeah, that probably be best.

443
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,310
你饿了吗  我知道有个地方不错
Are you hungry? I know a great place for lunch.

444
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,660
-哪里  -很期待吧
- Where? - Oh, don't you worry.

445
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,180
你闻到香味就知道了
You'll know it when you smell it.

446
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}通缉  福林?莱德  小偷

447
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,270
皇家的马
Oh, a Palace horse.

448
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,460
你的主人呢
Where's your rider?

449
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,550
瑞普兹
Rapunzel.

450
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,900
瑞普兹
Rapunzel!

451
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,450
瑞普兹  放下你的头发来
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

452

你闻到了吗  用鼻子深深吸一口气
You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.

464
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,930
让气味完全进入身体
Really let that seep in.

465
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,950
闻到什么了  我觉得一部分是人的体味
What are you getting? Because to me, it's part man smell.

466
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,830
另一部分是恶棍的味道

467
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,940
不知道为什么  总的来说
I don't know why, but overall,

468
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,270
这里闻起来很糟糕

她自己长的  你胡子上的是血吗

美女  看这里  看他胡子上的血

你看起来不舒服啊  美女
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

475

我们还是回家吧  
Maybe we should get you home.

476
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,210
今天收工

477
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,420
不过往好了说  毕竟这里是五星级餐厅
Probably be better off. This is a five star joint after all.

478

如果你觉得这儿不舒服的话

479
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,890
或许你应该回塔里去

480
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,580
这是你吗
Is this you?

00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,570

格瑞特  找警卫来

484
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,210
那赏金够我买个新的钩子了
That reward's going to buy me a new hook.

485
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,650
我要用那笔钱
I can use the money.

486
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,680
那我呢  我穷死了
What about me? I'm broke.

487
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,090
伙计们  停  
Boys, stop!

488
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,600
我们能摆平这问题
We can work this out.

489
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,050
放开他
Hey, leave him alone.

490
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,650
先生们  求求你们了  
Gentlemen, please.

491
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,100
把我的向导还给我  坏蛋们
Give me back my guide, ruffians.

492
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,800
别打鼻子  别打鼻子  别打鼻子
Not the nose, not the nose, not the nose!

493
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,780
放他下来
Put him down!

494
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,770
好吧  我不知道我在哪儿
Okay, I don't know where I am,

495
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,500
但我要他带我去看天灯
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

496
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,820
因为我这一辈子的梦想就是看天灯
because I've been dreaming about them my entire life.

497
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,520
行行好吧
Find your humanity.

498
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,630
你们难道不曾有过梦想吗
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

499

我  有过梦想
I, had a dream.

500
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,130
曾经
Once.

501
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,290
我是人见人怕的恶棍
I'm malicious mean and scary.

502
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,360
我的冷笑能让牛奶凝结
My sneer could curdle dairy.

503
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,660
残暴的念想使我双手不再干净
And violence-wise my hands are not the cleanest.

504
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,310
但除却我狰狞的模样  火爆的脾气和钩子
But despite my evil look, and my temper and my hook.

505
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,810
我一直渴望成为一名钢琴演奏家
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.

506
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,570
看我在台上演奏着莫扎特
Can't you see me on the stage performing Mozart.

507
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,200
敲击着琴键  直到音符跳跃
Tickling the ivories, 'til they gleam.

508
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,470
没错  我更愿自己的混合调调
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.

509
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,070
被大伙儿称作音乐刺客
For my killer show-tune medley.

510
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,470
谢谢
Thank you.

511
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,210
因为我内心深处有个梦想
'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream.

512
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,550
他有一个梦想  他有一个梦想
He's got a dream, he's got a dream.

513
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,060
看  我并不如所见般的邪恶残暴
See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem.

514
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,690
尽管我喜欢弄断别人的腿
Though I feel like breaking femurs.

515
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,780
请把我算作有梦想的人
You can count me with the dreamers.

516
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,420
就像所有人一样  我也有个梦想
Like everybody else, I've gotta dream.

517
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,980
我身上布满伤疤肿块和淤青
I've got scars and lumps and bruises.

518
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,190
再加上这里还有狐臭
Plus something here that oozes.

519
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,870
更别再提我的皮肤
Let's not even mention my complexion.

520
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,020
但我除了有六个脚趾
But despite my extra toes.

521
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,930
甲状腺肿大还有酒糟鼻
And my goiter and my nose.

522
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,030
我真心渴望一段爱情
I really want to make a love connection.

523

瞧我与一位娇小的女士
Can't you see me with a special little lady.

524
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,320
荡舟水上  顺溪漂流
Rowing in a row boat, down the stream.

525
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,360
尽管我是个恶心的混蛋
Though I'm one disgusting blighter.

526
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,400
但我愿意去爱  而非好战
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

527
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,450
因为我内心深处有个梦想
'Cause way down deep inside, I gotta dream.

528
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,120
我有一个梦想  我有一个梦想
I gotta dream, I gotta dream.

529
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,600
我知道一切终将实现
And I know one day will never reign supreme.

530
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,780
尽管我的长相吓得人尖叫
Though my face leaves people screaming.

531
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,890
但内心还是个做梦的孩子
There's a child behind it dreaming.

532
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,610
就像所有人一样  我也有个梦想
Like everybody else, I've gotta dream.

533

00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,960
那你呢
What about you?

540
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,290
-对不起  我吗  -你的梦想是什么
- I'm sorry, me? -What's your dream?

541
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,660
不  不  不  不好意思  我不唱歌
No, no, no. Sorry boys, I don't sing.

542
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,690
我如你们也有梦  也不算梦
I have dreams like you, no really.

543
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,280
更加微不足道  还有点矫情
Just much less, touchy-feely.

544

有一个地方温暖如春  阳光明媚

淹没在巨大的钱堆里

547
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,280
-我有一个梦想  -她有一个梦想

548
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,190

他们有一个梦想  我们有一个梦想

把这里翻遍了也要找到他
Find him, turn the place upside down if you have to!

567

密道  来吧  伙计们  进去  
A passage, come on men, let's go.

小心点
Play it safe.

00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,290
我们去夺回王冠
We'll go get the crown.

00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,880
我有个梦想  我有梦想
I gotta dream, I got some dream.

581
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,850
谁给我来一杯
I, ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

我发现一个大美女
Because I just found me a tall drink of water.

583

密道通往哪里
Where does that tunnel lead out?

刀
Knife!

586

抱歉  美女  我可不喜欢追溯往事
Whoa, whoa, sorry, Blondie, I don't do back story.

594
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,610
但我却对你的故事很好奇
However I am becoming very interested in yours.

595
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,080
我知道不能提到你的头发
Now I... I know I'm not suppose to mention the hair.

596
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,900
-不行  -或是你妈妈
- Nope. - Or, the Mother.

597
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,740
老实说  我也不敢问那只青蛙的事
Frankly I'm too scared to ask about the frog.

598
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,100
-它是变色龙  -差不多
- Chameleon. - Nuance.

599
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,630
我要问的是
Here's my question though,

600
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,050
既然你这么想去看天灯
if you want to see the lanterns so badly,

601
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,410
那以前为什么没去过呢
why haven't you gone before?

602
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,270
好吧
Uhh, hey, well...

603
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,780
福林
Uh, Flynn...

604
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,670
福林
Flynn!

605
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,630
跑  快跑
Run, run!

606
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,170
他们是什么人
Who's that?

607
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,370
他们可不喜欢我
They don't like me.

608
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,800
-那些人呢  -他们也不喜欢我
- Who's that? - They don't like me either.

609
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,100
-那又是谁  -总而言之
- Who's that? - Let's just assume for the moment,

610
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,620
这里的每个人都不喜欢我
that everyone here doesn't like me.

611
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,120
拿着
Here.

612
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,390
这一刻  我等待已久了
I've waited a long time for this.

613
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,240
妈妈咪呀  我真该弄个这样的锅
Oh mama, I have got to get me one of these.

614
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,200
这可是我干过最诡异的事情
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done.

615
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,640
三局两胜如何
How 'bout two out of three?

616
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,020
福林
Flynn!

617
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,420
福林  小心
Flynn, look out.

618
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,760
抓好了
Hold on.

619
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,310
你俩真该照照镜子  你们看起来
You should see your faces. Because you look...

620
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,000
可笑极了
Ridiculous.

621
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,570
快来  美女
Come on, Blondie.

622
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,860
快跳
Jump.

623
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:00,450
没用的  我什么都看不见
It's no use, I can't see anything.

624
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,160
没用的
Hey, there's no point.

625
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,010
下面黑黢黢的
It's pitch black down there.

626
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,240
这都是我的错
This is all my fault.

627
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,020
妈妈说得对  我不该这样做
She was right, I never should have done this.

628
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,830
我太...
I'm so...

629
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,120
我太对不起你了  福林
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

630
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,340
尤金
Eugene.

631
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,660
什么
What?

632
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,500
我的真名叫尤金?弗里茨伯特
My real name is, Eugene Fitzherbert.

633
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,070
应该让你知道
So you might as well know.

634
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,530
我的头发有魔力  当我唱歌时它会发光
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.

635
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,590
什么
What?

636
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,890
我的头发有魔力  当我唱歌时它会发光
I have magic hair, that glows when I sing.

637
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,240
仙花闪耀  魔力显现
Flower gleam and glow. Let your power shine.

638
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,410
我们成功了
We made it.

639
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,270
她的头发会发光
Her hair glows.

640
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,000
我们得救了  得救了
We're alive. I'm alive!

641
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,330
-我可真没想到  -尤金
- I didn't see that coming.  - Eugene...

642
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,830
你的头发真的会发光
You're hair actually glows.

643
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,720
-尤金  -她的头发怎么会发光
- Eugene... - Why does her hair glow?

644
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,040
-尤金  -怎么了
- Eugene! - What?

645
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,870
它不仅会发光
It doesn't just glow.

646
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,930
他干嘛冲我笑
Why is he smiling at me?

647
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,620
我要杀了他
I'll kill him.

648
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,350
我要杀了莱德
I'll kill that, Rider.

649
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,850
我们去城池边截住他
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

650
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,070
拿回王冠  走吧  
And get back the crown, come on.

651
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,660
小伙子们
Boys.

652
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,950
你们大概不想像野狗般
Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs

653
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,750
原地兜圈子吧
chasing their tails,

654
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,850
然后好好想想
and think for a moment.

655
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,250
拜托  根本没必要
Oh, please, there's no need for that.

656
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,540
如果你们只想要这个  那随你们的便
Well, if that's all you desire, then be on your way.

657
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,470
我本想给你们比这值钱一千倍的的东西
I was going to offer you something worth one thousand crowns,

658
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,480
能让你们无法想象的富有
would have made you rich beyond belief.

659
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
这还不是最好的呢
And that wasn't even the best part.

660
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,070
算了吧  这就是人生啊
Oh well, C'est la vie.

661
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,320
好好享受你们的王冠吧
Enjoy your crown.

662
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,560
最好的是什么
What's the best part?

663
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,910
还可以顺便报复福林?莱德
It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.

664
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,400
你神秘兮兮地
So you're being strangely cryptic

665
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,280
把你的魔发缠在我受伤的手上干什么
as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.

666
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,680
抱歉
Sorry.

667
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:54,260
你可不要被吓坏了
Just don't, don't freak out.

668
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,450
仙花闪耀  
Flower gleam and glow,

669
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,750
魔力显现
let your powers shine.

670
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,570
倒转时光  
Make the clock reverse,

671
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:15,400
带回往昔美好
bring back what once was mine.

672
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,990
抚平创伤  
Heal what has been hurt,

673
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,720
改变命运
change the fates design.

674
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,890
返还吾之所失  
Save what has been lost,

675
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,020
带回往昔美好
bring back what once was mine.

676
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:37,870
往昔美好
What once was mine.

677
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,110
千万别吓倒啊
Please don't freak out.

678
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,520
我才没吓倒  你吓倒了吗
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out, are you freaking out?

679
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,210
我只是对你的头发很感兴趣
No, I'm just very interested in your hair.

680
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,980
还有它的魔力
And the magical qualities that it possesses.

681
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,780
你能这样做究竟有多久了
How long has it been doing that, exactly?

682
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,570
我想一直都是这样吧
Forever, I guess.

683
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,960
妈妈说当我还是个婴儿时  
Mother said when I was a baby,

684
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,100
就有人想剪了它
people tried to cut it.

685
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,500
他们想把它占为己有
They wanted to take it for themselves.

686
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,810
但是一旦被剪了
But, once it's cut.

687
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,500
它就会变成褐色  并且失去魔力
It turns brown, and looses its power.

688
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,830
这样的神赋魔力  必须好好保护
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

689
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,080
因此妈妈从不让我...
That's why mother never let me...

690
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:36,020
因此我从未离开
That's why... I never left the...

691
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,920
你从未离开过那座塔
You never left that tower.

692
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,940
而且还打算回去吗
And you're still gonna go back?

693
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,680
不  是的
No... Yes.

694
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,430
这很复杂
It's complicated.

695
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,310
那么尤金?弗里茨伯特  是吧
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

696
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:10,070
好吧  我跟你讲个可怜孤儿
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare you the sob story of

697
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,160
尤金?弗里茨伯特的悲惨故事  他是个
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's a little bit of a...

698
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,870
他是个倒霉鬼
It's a little bit of a downer.

699
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,740
有这样一本书
There was this book.

700
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,340
我以前每天晚上都会读给小孩子们听
A book I used to read every night to all the younger kids.

701
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,160
福林吉纳?莱德的故事
The tales of Flynnigan Rider.

702
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,760
他是个恃强凌弱的恶棍  
Swashbuckling rogue,

703
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,960
也是世上最富有的人
richest man alive.

704
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,750
也很会讨女人欢心
Not bad with the ladies either.

705
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,940
当然也没什么好炫耀的
Nothing to ever brag about, of course.

706
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,460
他也是个小偷吗
Was he a thief too?

707
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,090
不是的
Ahh, well no.

708
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,040
实际上  他有足够的钱
Actually, he had enough money

709
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,640
去做任何他想做的事
to do anything that he wanted to do.

710
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,370
他可以想去哪里就去哪里
He could go anywhere that he wanted to go.

711
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,560
对一个一无所有的孩子来说
And... And, for a kid, with nothing.

712
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,580
我不知道  我...
I don't know, I...

713
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,060
似乎这是个更好的选择
It just seemed like a better option.

714
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,560
你千万别告诉任何人  好吗
You can't tell anyone, about this, okay?

715
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,120
那可会毁了我的名声
It could ruin my whole reputation.

716
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,030
我们可不想那样
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

717
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,800
男人的名誉可是高于一切的
Oh, the thing about a reputation, it's all that a man has.

718
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,120
好吧  我应该...
Um, well I should uh...

719
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,570
我应该再去找点木柴来
I, I should get some more firewood.

720
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,320
说真的  
For the record,

721
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,600
比起福林?莱德  我更喜欢尤金?弗里茨伯特
I like Eugene fitzherbert much better than, Flynn Rider.

722
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,390
你可是第一个这样说的人
Well, then you'd be the first.

723
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,370
谢谢
But, thank you.

724
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,520
我还以为他永远都不会离开呢
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

725
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,820
妈妈
Mother?

726
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,820
你好啊  亲爱的
Hello, dear.

727
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,940
但我...我...我们不是...
But I... I... Don't we...

728
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,960
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

729
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,900
很简单
Oh, it was easy really.

730
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,430
只要顺着彻彻底底背叛的声音寻来
I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal,

731
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,160
就找到了
and followed that.

732
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,960
-妈妈...  -我们回家去  瑞普兹
- Mother... - We're going home, Rapunzel.

733
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,390
-现在就回  -你...你不懂
- Now. - You... You don't understand.

734
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,220
这趟旅程很不可思议
I've been on this incredible journey.

735
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,430
我见识学到了很多东西
And I've seen and learned so much.

736
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,230
我还遇见了一个人
I even met someone.

737
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,570
是啊  被通缉的贼  我真为你自豪啊
Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud.

738
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,690
-快来  瑞普兹  -妈妈  等等
- Come on, Rapunzel. - Mother, wait.

739
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,710
我觉得...我觉得他喜欢我
I think... I think he likes me.

740
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,720
喜欢你吗  拜托  
Likes you? Please,

741
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,330
瑞普兹  你可真是疯了
Rapunzel, that's demented.

742
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,570
但是妈妈  我  
But mother, I...

743
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,370
这就是我从不让你出去的原因
This is why you never should have left.

744
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,580
宝贝  你自己臆想出来的所有浪漫
Dear, this whole romance that you've invented,

745
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,350
都证明你很傻很天真
just proves you're to naive to be here.

746
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:40,630
他为什么会喜欢你  真是服了你
Why would he like you? Oh come on now, really.

747
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,910
看看你  你觉得他爱上你了吗
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?

748
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,270
别傻了  跟妈妈回家
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.

749
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,330
妈妈
Mother...

750
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:53,770
-我不要  -你不要吗
- No! - No?

751
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,650
我懂了
I see how it is.

752
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,260
瑞普兹最清楚
Rapunzel, knows best.

瑞普兹好成熟
Rapunzel's so mature, now.

好一位聪明又成熟的小姑娘   
Such a clever grown up, Miss.

755
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,230
瑞普兹最清楚
Rapunzel knows best.

756
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,340
好啊  既然你如此确信
Fine, if you're so sure now.

757
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,680
那就把这个给他
Go ahead then give him, this!

758
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,870
怎么在你这里
How did you?

759
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,770
他只为此而留下
This is why he's here.

760
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,150
不要被他欺骗
Don't let him deceive you.

761
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,590
-把这个交给他  等着瞧  -我会的
- Give it to him, watch, you'll see. - I will.

762
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:26,220
相信我宝贝儿  他定会马上离开
Trust me my dear, that's how fast he'll leave you.

763
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,080
我不会说早告诉过你  不会
I won't say I told you so... No.

764
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,340
瑞普兹最清楚
Rapunzel knows best.

765
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,020
如果他就是你的梦之船
So if he's such a dream boat.

766
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,890
-那就去考验他  -妈妈  等等
- Go and put him, to the test. - Mother, wait.

767
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:43,740
如果他欺骗了你  可不要回来哭鼻子
If he's lying, don't come crying.

768
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:50,350
妈妈才最清楚
Mother, knows best.

769
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:58,540
我能问你件事吗
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?

770
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,870
我的手有可能
Is there any chance that

771
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,100
得到超能力吗
I'm going to get super strength in my hand?

772
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,320
说句老实话  
Because I'm not going to lie.

773
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,730
那样可真是太棒了
That would be stupendous.

774
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,910
你还好吗
Hey, you all right?

775
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,590
抱歉  我没事
Oh, sorry, yes.

776
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,820
只是在想事情
Just um, lost in thought, I guess.

777
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,130
我的意思是
I mean because here's the thing.

778
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,170
超人的帅脸  我已经有了
Superhuman good looks, I've always had 'em.

779
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,970
我天生就有  但超能力呢
Born with it, but superhuman strength?

780
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,710
你觉得可能吗  我只是
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...

781
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,290
耐心点  小伙子们  
Patience, boys.

782
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:38,040
好事多磨
All good things to those who wait.

783
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,790
怎么了
Hmm, what?

784
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,430
我希望你是来道歉的
Well, I hope you're here to apologize.

785
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,500
不不  快把我放下  停下  放开我
No, no, put me down. Stop it. Let... Me... Go!

786
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,740
把他给我
Give me, him.

787
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,250
放轻松  放松  冷静
Easy boy, easy, calm down.

788
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,540
冷静  孩子
Easy boy.

789
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,620
冷静
Easy.

790
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,080
这就对了
That's it.

791
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,380
现在  坐下
Now sit.

792
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,210
-坐下  -搞错没啊
- Sit. - What?

793
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,130
现在放下靴子
Now drop the boot.

794
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,770
放下
Drop it.

795
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:49,830
你真是个好孩子
Oh, you are such a good boy.

796
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,320
是啊  你真乖
Yes, you are.

797
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,350
你千辛万苦来抓这个坏蛋  累坏了吧
You all tired, from chasing the bad man all over the place?

798
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,490
你说什么
Excuse me?

799
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,390
却没人感激你  对吧
Nobody appreciates you, do they?

800
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,420
对吧
Do they?

801
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,010
拜托  它可是匹坏马
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

802
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,510
他可是个大甜心
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.

803
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,330
没错吧
Isn't that right?

804
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,590
马克西姆斯
Maximus.

805
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,300
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

806
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,250
听着  今天是我人生中最重要的一天
Look, today is kinda the biggest day of my life.

807
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,290
因此我希望你不要抓他
And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.

808
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,000
只要二十四小时就好
Just for twenty four hours and then,

809
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,260
然后你俩爱怎么追就怎么追
you can chase each other to your hearts content.

810
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,310
好吗
Okay?

811
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,350
而且告诉你  今天还是我生日
And it's also my birthday. Just so you know.

812
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,350
通缉  福林?莱德  小偷

813
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,860
抱歉
Sorry.

01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,680
谢谢
Thank you.

815
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,830
献给我们失踪的公主
It's for the lost Princess.

816
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,620
快上船吧
To the boats.

817
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,150
马克斯
Hey, Max.

818
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,900
怎么啦  我买的啦
What? I bought them.

819
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,950
大部分是买的
Most of them.

820
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,700
我们要去哪儿
Where are we going?

821
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,960
你生命中最好的一天
Well, best day of your life.

822
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,960
我想你应该坐条好船
I figured you should have a decent seat.

823
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,490
你还好吗
You okay?

824
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,160
我有些害怕
I'm terrified.

825
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,510
为什么
Why?

826
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,130
我在窗口已经盼了十八年
I've been looking out the window for eighteen years.

827
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:36,090
幻想着那些天灯升起  
Dreaming about what it would feel like

828
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,980
飞向天空的情景
when those lights rise in the sky.

829
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,170
如果现实和我想象的完全不一样怎么办
What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be?

830
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,160
会一样的
It will be.

831
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,500
如果不一样呢
And what if it is?

832
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,610
那我该怎么办
What will I do then?

833
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,370
我想那也是好事
Well that's the good part, I guess.

834
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,340
你就可以找个新的梦想了
You get to go find a new dream.

835
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,590
日日夜夜  望向窗外
All those days watching from the windows.

836
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:42,470
年年岁岁  凝望远方
All those years outside looking in.

837
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:47,150
那些时光  从不知自己
All that time, never even knowing

838
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:51,300
有多么无知
just how blind I've been.

839
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:57,870
我已至此  闪耀星空下  
Now I'm here. Blinking in the starlight.

840
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:01,960
我已至此  幡然领悟  
Now I'm here. Suddenly I see.

841
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,720
伫立于此  一切如此清晰  
Standing here. It's oh, so clear.

842
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,570
这里就是我的归依
I'm where I'm meant to be.

843
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,770
我终于看到了那光芒  
And at last, I see the light.

844
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:20,810
一如浓雾尽散
And it's like the fog has lifted.

845
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:25,190
我终于看到了那光芒  
And at last, I see the light.

846
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:29,780
一如天空换新颜
And it's like the sky is new.

847
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,590
温暖  真实  而明亮
And it's warm and real and bright.

848
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:39,780
世界也为之改变
And the world has somehow shifted.

849
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,070
霎那间  一切皆已不同
All at once, everything looks different.

850
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:52,960
因为 我遇见了你
Now that I see you.

851
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,530
我也有东西要给你
I have something for you, too.

852
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,790
我早就该把它给你的  但我只是害怕
I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.

853
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,730
而现在  我不怕了
And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore.

854
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,200
你明白我的意思吗
You know what I mean?

855
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,050
我也不再害怕
I'm starting to.

856
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:22,450
日日夜夜  追寻空中楼阁
All those days, chasing down a daydream.

857
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:26,820
年年岁岁  活在空虚之中
All those years, living in a blur.

858
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:31,980
那些时光  从未曾真正发现
All that time, never truly seeing

859
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:35,640
万物的真相  
things, the way they were.

860
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:42,080
她已至此  闪耀星空下  
Now she's here. Shining in the starlight.

861
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,230
她已至此  我幡然领悟  
Now she's here. Suddenly I know.

862
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:51,230
只要有她相伴  如水晶般清晰  
If she's here. It's crystal clear.

863
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:55,140
这里就是我的归依
I'm where I'm meant to go.

864
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,590
我终于看到了那光芒
And at last, I see the light.

865
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:03,590
一如浓雾尽散
And it's like the fog has lifted.

866
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:08,160
我终于看到了那光芒 
And at last, I see the light.

867
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,400
一如天空换新颜
And it's like the sky is new.

868
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,060
温暖  真实  而明亮
And it's warm and real and bright.

869
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:23,380
世界也为之改变
And the world has somehow shifted.

870
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:30,850
霎那间  一切皆已不同
All at once, everything is different.

871
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:35,440
因为  我遇见了你
Now that I, see you.

872
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:49,900
因为  我  遇见了你
Now that I... see you.

873
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:08,870
怎么了
Is everything okay?

874
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,780
没  没事
Huh? Oh yes.

875
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,990
当然没事
Uh, yes of course.

876
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,010
我只是
I just...

877
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,660
我很抱歉  一切都很好
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

878
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,640
只是我有些事情要去处理
There's just something I have to take care of.

879
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,590
好吧
Okay.

880
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,880
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

881
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,770
没事的  帕斯卡
It's all right, Pascal.

882
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,130
你们在这啊
Ahh, there you are.

883
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,540
自从那天走散后  
I've been searching everywhere for you guys.

884
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,300
我到处找都找不到你们
Since we got separated.

885
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,800
新鬓角修得不错啊
Hey the sideburns are coming in nice, huh?

886
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,370
你应该很满意吧
You gotta be excited about that.

887
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:03,700
总之  我只是想说
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

888
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,560
我不该逃跑的  王冠归你们了
I shouldn't have split. The crown is all yours.

889
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,780
我会想你们的  但我觉得这样  最好  
I'll miss you, but I think its for the... best.

890
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:15,430
又想耍我们了吧  莱德
Holding out on us again? Hey, Rider?

891
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,690
-什么  -我们听说你找到了一些东西
- What? - We heard you found something.

892
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,840
一些  比王冠更值钱的东西
Something much more valuable than a crown.

893
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,640
我们要她  来代替王冠
We want her, instead.

894
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:39,300
我还以为你带着王冠  丢下我跑了
I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.

895
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,420
他是跑了
He did.

896
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,410
什么  不可能
What? No.

897
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,430
他不会的
He wouldn't.

898
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,070
你自己看吧
See for yourself.

899
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:59,910
尤金
Eugene?

900
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,880
尤金
Eugene!

901
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,120
公平交易
Fair trade.

902
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,760
一个王冠  换个魔发女孩
A crown, for the girl with the magic hair.

903
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,750
你说人们为了永葆青春健康
How much do you think someone

904
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,720
愿意付我们多少钱
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

905
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,560
不要  求求你们

908
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:30,940
瑞普兹
Rapunzel!

909
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,440
妈妈
Mother?

910
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:41,090
我的宝贝女儿
Oh, my precious girl.

911

妈妈
Mother.

912
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,940
你没事吧

伤到哪没有
Are you hurt?

914
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,740
-妈妈  你怎么  -我很担心你
- Mother, how did you? - I was so worried about you dear.

915
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,150
所以我跟着你
So I followed you.

916
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,010
然后我看到他们要伤害你
And I saw them attack you.

917
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,840
好了  我们走吧  趁他们还没醒
All right, let's go, let's go before they come to.

918
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,630
你是对的  妈妈
You were right, mother.

919
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:30,270
你说得都是对的
You were right about everything.

920
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:32,940
我明白  宝贝
I know darling.

921

看
Look!

923
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,570
是王冠
The crown.

924
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:53,510
瑞普兹
Rapunzel.

925
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,570
瑞普兹
Rapunzel!

926
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,110
不不不  等等  伙计们
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Guys, guys.

927
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:04,940
瑞普兹
Rapunzel!

928
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,520
该做个了断了  莱德
Let's get this over with, Rider.

929
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,870
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

930
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,390
就当一切都没发生过
There, it never happened.

931
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,990
好了  洗洗准备吃晚饭了
Now, wash up for dinner.

932
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,700
我煮了榛子汤
I'm making hazel nut soup.

933
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,200
我告诉过你  瑞普兹
I really did try, Rapunzel.

934
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,430
我警告过你  外面世界的险恶
I tried to warn you, what was out there.

935
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:02,590
黑暗  自私  残酷的世界
The world is dark, and selfish, and cruel.

936
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,810
即便有一缕最微弱的阳光
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine.

937
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,750
也会被摧毁
It destroys it.

938
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,480
你们怎么知道她的
How did you know about her?

939
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,630
告诉我  快说
Tell me, now!

940
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,880
不是我们
It wasn't us.

941
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,350
是那个老太婆
It was the old lady.

942
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,980
老太婆
Old lady?

943
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,470
等等  不要  等等
Wait, no, wait!

944
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,310
你们不明白  她有麻烦了
You don't understand, she's in trouble.

945
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:04,270
等等
Wait!

946
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,540
瑞普兹
Rapunzel?

947
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,360
瑞普兹  怎么了
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

948
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,130
你没事吧
Are you all right?

949
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,070
我就是失踪的公主
I'm the lost princess.

950
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,360
大声点  瑞普兹
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.

951
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,170
你知道我多讨厌别人说话含糊不清
You know how I hate the mumbling.

952
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,060
我就是失踪的公主
I am the lost Princess.

953
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,100
对不对
Aren't I?

954
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,780
我说得还不够清楚吗  妈妈
Did I mumble, Mother?

955
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,730
还是  我不该这么称呼你
Or should I even call you that?

956
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:39,240
瑞普兹  你知道你在说什么吗
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

957
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,840
你怎么会问这么荒唐的问题
Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?

958
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,050
是你  都是你干的
It was you! It was all, you.

959
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:50,930
我做的一切  都是为了保护你
Everything I did, was to protect you.

960
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,690
-瑞普兹  -我的一生
- Rapunzel. - I spent my entire life.

961
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:58,670
都在躲避那些想利用我魔力的人
hiding from people who would use me for my power.

962
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:01,150
-瑞普兹  -而我最应该躲避的人
- Rapunzel! - And I should have been hiding.

963
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,190
是你
From you.

964
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:03,400
你要去哪
Where will you go?

965
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,390
他不会在那儿等你
He won't be there for you.

966
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,220
你对他做了什么
What did you do to him?

967
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,200
那个罪犯  以他的罪行应该会吊死
That criminal, is to be hanged for his crimes.

968
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,910
-不  -现在  一切都没事了
- No. - Now, now. It's all right.

969
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:15,970
听我说
Listen to me.

970
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:19,470
这一切  都是不可避免
All of this is as it should be.

971
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,570
不
No!

972
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:23,900
你看错了这个世界
You were wrong about the world.

973
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,140
你也看错了我
And you were wrong about me.

974
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:30,650
我再也不会让你利用我的头发
And I will never let you use my hair, again!

975
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,680
你要逼我当坏人?
You want me to be the bad guy?

976
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,570
好
Fine.

977
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:46,100
那我就坏给你看
Now I'm the bad guy.

978
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:01,520
这是怎么了
What's this?

979
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,400
开门
Open up.

980
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:06,210
通关密码是什么
What's the password?

981
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,980
-什么  -错啦
- What? - Nope.

982
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,610
开门
Open this door.

983
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,520
大错特错
Not even close.

984
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,720
你有三秒钟时间
You have three seconds.

985
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,110
一
One...

986
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,340

987
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,450
三
Three...

988
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,130
平底锅  谁想得到呢  对吧
Frying pans. Who knew, right?

989
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,000
-低下头  -低下头
- Head down? - Head down.

990
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,110
-夹紧手臂  -夹紧手臂
- Arms in? - Arms in.

991
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,190
-分开双腿  -分开双腿
- Knees apart? - Knees apart.

992
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,170
分开双腿
Knees apart?

993
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,360
我为什么要双腿分...
Why do I need to keep my knees apar...

994
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,080
马克斯
Max.

995
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:15,090
是你叫他们来的?
You brought them here?

996
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,480
谢谢
Thank you.

997
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,520
真的  谢谢你
No really, thank you.

998
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,000
我觉得  这段时间  
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time

999
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,240
我们之间可能有些误会
we've just misunderstanding one another.

1000
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,780
我们真的  没错  你是对的
And we're really just, yeah your right.

1001
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,410
我们该走了
We should go.

1002
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,190
马克斯
Max.

1003
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,730
马克斯
Max!

1004
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:57,000
好了  马克斯  让我看看你能跑多快
Okay Max, let's see how fast you can run.

1005
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,380
瑞普兹
Rapunzel.

1006
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,860
瑞普兹  放下你的头发来
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

1007
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:39,080
瑞普兹  我还以为再也见不到你了
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again.

1008
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,940
现在  看看你都干了什么  瑞普兹
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.

1009
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,360
别担心  宝贝
Oh don't worry, dear.

1010
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,720
他会把我们的秘密带进坟墓
Our secret will die with him.

1011
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,180
而我们
And as for us?

1012
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:04,280
我们要重新去一个没人能找到你的地方
We are going where no one will ever find you, again.

1013
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,260
瑞普兹  真的  够了
Rapunzel, really. Enough all ready.

1014
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,760
别再反抗了
Stop fighting me.

1015
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,170
不  我不会放弃的
No! I won't stop.

1016
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:22,840
我余生的每一分钟都会用来反抗你
For every minute of the rest of my life I will fight.

1017
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:26,660
我永远不会停止尝试离开你
