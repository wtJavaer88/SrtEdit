隐藏在壮观的天堂瀑布掩护之下

这强大的飞行器由查尔斯・孟兹亲自设计

他设计的飞行器充分考虑到狗的舒适

装备了狗狗洗澡机和跑步机

但是这次孟兹给我们带回了什么呢

先生们  请看天堂瀑布怪兽

国家探险协会指控孟兹

协会开除了孟兹的会员资格

32
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,135
倍感耻辱的孟兹发誓要重返天堂瀑布

33
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,133

00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,931
我发誓要活捉这野兽

35
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,720
成功以前我绝不回来

00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,502

Proceed.

154
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,434
-下午好  -直接跳到最后
- "Good afternoon..." -But skip to the end!

155
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,360
看到这些了吗  这些是野外探险徽章
See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges.

156
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,942
你可能注意到这里少了一个
You may notice one is missing.

157
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,574
这是帮助老年人的徽章
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

158
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,366
如果我有了  我就能成为资深野外探险者了
If I get it, I'll become a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

159
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,076
誓要探索野外
The wilderness must be explored!

160
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,125
那会很棒的  会有一个盛大的典礼
It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony,

161
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,715
所有的父亲都会来  为我们带上的徽章
And all the dads come and they pin on our badges.

162
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,758
所以你想帮助一位老人对吗
So, you want to assist an old person?

163
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,255
这样我就能成为资深野外探险者了
Yep! Then I'll be a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

164
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,601
-你有没有听说过沙锥鸟  -沙锥鸟
- You ever heard of a snipe? - Snipe?

165
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,678
是一种鸟  珍珠眼
A bird. Beady eyes.

166
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,972
每天晚上  它都溜进我的花园
Every night it sneaks into my yardand

167
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:07,766
偷吃我的杜鹃花
And gobbles my poor azaleas.

168
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,010
我年老体弱
I'm elderly and infirm.

169
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,633
抓不住它
I can't catch it.

170
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,567
如果有人能帮我
If only someone could help me.

171
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,932
我  我 我来干
Me, me, I'll do it!

172
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,071
你行吗  它可是很狡猾的
I don't know, it's awfully crafty.

173
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,118
你得拍手三次来引诱它
You'd have to cap your hands three times to lure it in.

174
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,988
我会找到它  弗雷德里克森先生
I'll find himr, Mr. Fredricksen!

175
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,456
我认为它的洞穴在两个街区外  若你穿过
I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past...

176
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,622
两个街区外  知道了  沙锥鸟
Two blocks down. Got it. Snipe.

177
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,545
过来这里  小锥锥  小锥锥
Here, snipey, snipey.

178
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,294
找到了把它带回来
Bring it back here when you find it.

179
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,461
沙锥鸟
Snipe!

180
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,674
好  继续往前开
Okay, keep her coming. Keep coming.

181
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,798
停  停  停
And stop. Stop. Stop!

182
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,510
什么  嘿  说你呢
Why.... Hey! Hey, you!

183
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,103
你  你知道自己在干嘛吗
What do you.... What do you think you re doing?

184
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,647
-我很抱歉  先生  -别碰那个
- I am so sorry sir. -Don't touch that

185
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,266
不不不  让我来帮你修好
No, no, no. Let me take care of that for you.

186
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,443
-离我的邮箱远一点  -先生  我
- Get away from our mailbox! - Hey Sir, I.

187
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,020
不许你碰它
I don't want you to touch it!

188
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,993
史蒂夫  你还好吧
Steve, you all right?

189
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,223
情况看起来不妙
It looks bad.

190
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,409
法庭传唤

191
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,195
抱歉  弗雷德里克森先生
Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen.

192
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,152
我认为你看起来不像会危害公共安全的人
You don't seem like a public menace to me.

193
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:48,824
拿着这个
Take this.

194
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,704
橡树林的人明天早上会来接你
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay?

195
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,015
我现在该怎么办  艾莉
What do I do now, Ellie?

196
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,436
早上好  先生们
Good morning, gentlemen.

197
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,338
早上好  弗雷德里克森先生
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.

198
00:20:42,514 --> 00:20:43,489
你准备好走了吗
You're ready to go?

199
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,696
早准备好了
Ready as I'll ever be.

200
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,115
能帮个忙替我拿着这个吗
Would you do me a favor and take this?

201
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,538
过会儿车上见
I'll meet you in the van in just a minute.

202
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,956
我想和老房子最后说声再见
I wanna say one last goodbye to the old place.

203
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,830
当然  多长时间都行  先生
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

204
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:05,428
很常见  他很可能是第八十次去浴室流泪
That's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

205
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,177
你肯定认为他应该把房子维护的更好
You think he'd take better care of His house

206
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,788
再见  孩子们
So long, boys!

207
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,470
我会从天堂瀑布给你们寄明信片的
I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!

208
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,214
南美洲

209
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,235
我们上路了  艾莉
We are on our way, Ellie.

210
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,901
弗雷德里克森先生
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.

211
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,388
是我  罗索
It's me, Russell.

212
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,469
你在外面做什么  孩子
What are you doing out here, kid?

213
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,306
我找到沙锥鸟了  我跟着它来到你的门廊
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch.

214
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,632
但这个沙锥鸟有根长尾巴
But this snipe had a long tail

215
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:50,236
看起来更像只大老鼠
And looked more like a large mouse.

216
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,742
请让我进屋吧
Please, let me in.

217
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,407
不
No.

218
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,168
好吧  你可以
Oh, alright, you can come....

219
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,583
进来
...in.

220
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,599
我从没见住过飞屋
I've never been in a floating house before.

221
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,494
护目镜  看这些东西
Goggles... Look at this stuff!

222
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:26,222
你准备去旅行吗
Wow! You're going on a trip?

223
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,025
天堂瀑布  时间迷失之地
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time".

224
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,852
你准备去南美洲吗  弗莱德里克森先生
You're going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?

225
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,778
别碰那个  你会弄脏的
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

226
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,943
大多数人都是做飞机
You know most people take a plane,

227
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:36,844
但你更聪明
But you're smart,

228
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:39,368
因为你可以带着电视  钟 还有行李
Because you have your tv, clocks and stuff.

229
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,367
哇  这是用来操控房子的吗
Whoa, is this how you steer your house?

230
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,868
真的管用吗
Does it really work?

231
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,367
孩子  你能不能停下
Kid would you stop with the....

232
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,043
-这是右转  -别碰那个
- This makes it go right. - Let go of that...

233
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,621
-这是左转  -放开手
- And that way's left. - Knock it off

234
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,755
看啊  大楼
Hey, look! Buildings.

235
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,760
这幢楼离的好近  我快能碰到它了
That building's so close, I could almost touch it!

236
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,091
这太棒了
Wow, this is great!

237
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,639
你也应该试试  弗雷德里克森先生
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.

238
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,894
看  两个街区之外
Look, there's a bus

239
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:08,139
就有一辆可以到我家的公交车
That could take me home two blocks away!

240
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,770
我可以从这儿看到你的房子
Hey, I can see your house from here.

241
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,652
别到处乱动  小鬼
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

242
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,319
恩  那样好像行不通
Well, that's not gonna work.

243
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,656
我知道那种云  是积雨云
I know that cloud, it's a cumulonimbus.

244
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,166
你知道吗  当冷热空气对流
Did you know that a cumulonimbus forms

245
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,155
积雨云就形成了
When warm air rises over cool air?

246
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,580
我吹了一晚上气球  图什么呀
I stayed up all night blowing up ballons... For what?

247
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,750
雷电就这样形成了
...and that's how we get lightning.

248
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,248
-不错  小鬼  -弗雷德里克森先生
- That's nice kid - Mr. Fredricksen?

249
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,172
-你在那儿干什么呢  -看
- What are you doing over there? - Look.

250
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,982
看到没  积雨云
See? Cumulonimbus.

251
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,057
我的包
My pack!

252
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,237
抓到了
Got ya!

253
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,227
我还以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

254
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,356
怎么了
What happened?

255
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,864
是我在驾驶  我做到了  我驾驶了房子
I steered us. I did it! I steered the house.

256
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,034
你驾驶的
Steered us?

257
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,864
你把自己的东西都绑住  然后小睡了一会
After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap.

258
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,040
所以我就掌舵  把房子开到了这儿
So I went ahead and steered us down here.

259
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,829
哦  是啊
Yeah, sure.

260
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,806
我不知道我们在哪儿
I can't tell where we are.

261
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,892
我们已经在南美啦
Oh, we're in South Amerca all right.

262
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,642
这只是个小问题  我用野外探险GPS定位的
It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

263
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,399
-GP 什么  -我爸爸送我的
- GP What? - My dad gave it to Me.

264
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,818
它能精确的显示我们在地球上的位置
It shows exacty where we are on the planet.

265
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,649
有这个宝贝  我们永远都不会迷路
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

266
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,245
我要把你放下去  找个公车站
Well get you down, find a bus stop,

267
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,419
你只要告诉他们  你要找妈妈
You just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother.

268
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,169
可以  但是我觉得天堂瀑布这儿没有公车
Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls.

269
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,675
好了  我必须得这么做
There. That ought to do it.

270
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,596
我给你点零钱坐车
Here, I'll give you some change for the bus fare.

271
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,175
不用了  我用公交卡就行
No, I'll just use my city bus pass.

272
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,248
我肯定得转十亿次车
That's gonna be Iike a billion on transfers

273
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:36,684
才能到家
To get back to my house.

274
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,110
弗雷德里克森先生  还要多久啊
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

275
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,852
我们飞得很高
Well, we're up pretty high.

276
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:50,035
估计降落得花上好几个小时呢
Could take hours to get down.

277
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,456
我觉得那是幢大楼什么的
That thing was.... Building or something.

278
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,959
那是什么  弗雷德里克森先生
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

279
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,378
不可能接近地面了啊
We can't be cose to the ground yet.

280
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,223
等等  不  不
Wait! Wait, no don't! Don't don't!

281
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,017
等等  等等
Wait, wait. Wait!

282
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,189
罗索  抓紧了
Russell, hang on.

283
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,905
-后退  退回去  -好
- Walk back. Walk back. - Okay.

284
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,831
加油  加油
Come on. Come on.

285
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,256
这是  这是哪儿
Where.... Where are we?

286
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,639
看起来既不是城市又不是丛林
This doesn't look like the city or the jungle,

287
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,095
弗雷德里克森先生
Mr. Fredricksen.

288
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,932
别担心  艾莉  我抓住了
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

289
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,755
就是那里
There it is!

290
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,327
艾莉  真美啊
Ellie, it's so beautiful!

291
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,243
我们成功了
We made it!

292
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,844
我们成功了  罗索  我们可以飞过去
We made it! Russe, we could float right overthere!

293
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:08,082
往上爬  爬呀
Climb up, climb up!

294
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,586
你是说  帮你
You mean, assist you?

295
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,919
-是啊  随便了  -好  我爬上去
- Yeah, yeah, whatever. - Okay, I'll climb up!

296
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,676
-小心点  -对不起
- Watch it! - Sorry.

297
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:31,151
你到了之后 先进去 然后把我拉上去
Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up.

298
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,490
听到了吗
Got it?

299
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,283
你到门口了没
You on the porch yet?

300
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,708
什么  居然这样
What? That's it?

301
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,031
我千里迢迢来到这儿
I came all this way here to get stuck

302
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:53,386
难道就困在这个碎石桩的另一头
At the wrong end of this rock pile?

303
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,136
好极了
Great.

304
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,079
如果我能帮你到那边
Hey, if I could assist you over there,

305
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,896
你能帮我的徽章签名吗
Would you sign off on my badge?

306
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,433
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

307
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:10,144
我们可以带你的房子走到瀑布那儿
We could walk your house to the fall.

308
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,860
-走路  -对啊
- Walk it? - Yeah.

309
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,822
毕竟我们已经降下来了
After all, we weigh it down,

310
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,932
我们可以走到那边去
We could walk it right overthere.

311
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,242
就当是游行中的大气球
Like a parade balloon.

312
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,829
我们要迅速且安静的走到瀑布
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly

313
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,536
不需要说唱音乐或霹雳舞
With no rap music or flash dancing.

314
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,902
最多三天
We have three days at best

315
00:33:29,902 --> 00:33:32,424
气球里的氦气就会漏完
Till the helium leaks out of those balloons.

316
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,009
如果到时候我们还没有到瀑布
And if we are not at the falls when that happens

317
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,428
-沙子  -我们就到不了了
-Sand - We're not getting to the falls.

318
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,381
我找到了沙子
I found sand!

319
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,923
别担心  艾莉
Don't you worry, Ellie.

320
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:43,931
我会把我们的房子带过去的
We'll get our house over there.

321
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,934
这已经很好玩了  不是吗
It is fun already, isn't it?

322
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,614
等我们到那儿的时候
By the tme we get there,

323
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,897
你会发现我帮了很大忙
You're gonna feel so assisted

324
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,825
弗莱德里克森先生
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,

325
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,617
如果我们不小心分开了
If we happen to get separated,

326
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,861
就用野外探险信号
Use the wilderness explorer call.

327
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,871
对了  我们为什么要去天堂瀑布
Wait, why are we going to paradise falls, again?

328
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,044
我们来玩个游戏吧
Hey, let's play a game.

329
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,372
游戏是  看谁沉默得最久
It's called "see who can be quiet the longest."

330
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,300
酷  我妈妈也喜欢这个游戏
Cool! My mom loves that game!

331
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,155
破玩意
Darn thing!

332
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,867
加油  罗索  快点啊
Come on, Russell. Would you hurry it up?

333
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,197
我累了  我膝盖疼
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

334
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,824
哪个膝盖
Which knee?

335
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,875
我胳膊肘疼  而且还想上厕所
My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.

336
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,714
我五分钟前问过你去不去
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

337
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,006
我那时还没一定要去
Well, I didn't have to go then!

338
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,491
我不想走了
I don't wanna walk anymore.

339
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:46,467
停一会吧
Can we stop?

340
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,293
罗索  如果你不走快点
Russell, if you don't hurry up,

341
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,644
老虎会来吃了你的
The tigers will eat you.

342
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:54,191
南美没有老虎  动物学
There are no tigers in South America. Zoology.

343
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,645
我的天啊
Oh, for the love of Pete!

344
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:59,480
快去灌木丛上厕所吧
Go on into the bushes and do your business.

345
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,735
没问题  帮我拿着东西
Okay. Here! Hold my stuff.

346
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,361
我一直都想试一试
I've always wanted to try this.

347
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,575
弗雷德里克森先生
Mr. Fredricksen,

348
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,662
我应该先挖洞还是后挖洞呢
Am I supposed to dig the ho e before or after?

349
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,334
不关我的事
None of my concern!

350
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,925
是先挖
Oh. It's before!

351
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,348
脚印
Tracks?

352
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,683
沙锥鸟
Snipe.

353
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,230

-这是什么  -一只沙锥鸟

370
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,764

There's no such thing as a snipe!

371
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,341
但你说过沙锥鸟偷吃

我喜欢狗
Hey, I like dogs!

421
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,548
那只狗刚刚是不是说了"你好"
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

422
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,845
没错
Oh yes.

423
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,974

我的主人给我做了这个项圈

我的主人是个聪明的好主人
My master is good and sma.

428
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,403
这不可能
It's not possible.

429
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,993
是真的  我的主人很聪明
Oh, it is, because my master is small.

430
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,858
酷  这些按钮是干什么的  小家伙

439
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,009
主人派我来执行一项特殊任务  就我一个
My pack sent me on a specia mission all by myself.

440
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,176
你有没有看到一只鸟

00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,505
我在找一只鸟  而且我已经闻到它的味道了

我从没这么近距离的看过
I have never seen one up close,

445
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:06,597
不过这就是我要找的鸟
But this is the bird.

446
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,190
我能把您的鸟带到营地当俘虏吗
May I take your bird up to camp as my prisoner?

447
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,844
可以  可以  带它走吧
Yes, yes, take it.

448
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:13,270
而且  路上你还可以学学怎么像真狗一样叫
And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog.

449
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,441
我会叫呀
I can bark.

450
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,780
还有嗥叫
And here's howling.

451
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,537
我能留着他吗  行吗  拜托
Can we keep him? Please, please, please.

452
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,787
-不行  -但这是一只会说话的狗
- No. - But it's a talking dog!

453
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,100
这不过是个古怪的把戏什么的
It's just a weird trick or something.

454
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:30,457
我们去瀑布吧
Let's get to the fall.

455
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,955
请当我的俘虏吧
Please be my prisoner!

456
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,624
请当我的俘虏吧
Oh please, oh, please be my prisoner!

457
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,638
就是这儿  我闻到那只鸟的味道了
Oh! Here it is. I picked up the bird's scent!

458
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,057
等等  等等  什么味道
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this?

459
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,975
巧克力  我闻到巧克力味了
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

460
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:49,564
我闻到了梅子干和姜汁奶油  他们是谁
I'm getting prunes and ginger cream. Who are they?

461
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,979
惨了  主人不会高兴的
Oh, man, the master will not be pleased.

462
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,781
我们最好告诉他  有人捉到了那只鸟
We'd better tell him someone took the bird,

463
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,103
行吗  阿尔法
Right, Alfa?

464
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,904
不
No.

465
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,825
很快那只鸟就又会是我们的了
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.

466
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,990
跟着气味走  朋友们
Find the scent, my compadres,

467
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,821
当然  对于你们付出的努力
And you too shall have much rewardings

468
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,664
主人也会好好奖赏你们的
From Master for the toil factor you wage.

469
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,643
阿尔法  我觉得你的项圈好像有问题
Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar.

470
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:12,746
你肯定是把它弄坏了
You must have broken it.

471
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,126
是啊  你声音怪怪的
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.

472
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,013
贝塔  伽马  也许你们想要  松鼠
Beta! Gamma! Mayhaps you desire to.... Squirrel

473
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,101
也许你们想挑战
Mayhaps you deslre to challenge the ranking

474
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,770
我凭借勇气和机智而被主人赐予的权利
That l have been assigned by my strength and cunning.

475
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,417
没有  没有  但也许逗逗想
No, no, no But Maybe Dug would.

476
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:33,645
你应该问问他
You might wanna ask him.

477
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,280
对  不知道他是不是执行"非常任务"时候
Yeah. I wonder if he's found the bird

478
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,572
已经抓到了那鸟
On his very specia mission

479
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,741
现在别和我提逗逗
Do not mention Dug to me at this time.

480
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,211
他的白痴差事会让他忙的团团转
His fool's errand will keep him most occupied!

481
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:47,072
绝对团团转
Most occupied indeed.

482
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,210
难道你们对我刚说的有异议吗
Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?

483
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,025
当然没有  但如果主人再知道
Sure, but the second Master finds out

484
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:56,585
你让逗逗单独行动
You sent Dug out by himself,

485
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,257
我们都会跟着遭殃的
None of us will get a treat.

486
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,468
你很聪明  亲爱的中尉
You are wise, my trusted lieutenant.

487
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,848
我是阿尔法  呼叫逗逗  快接听
This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in. Dug.

488
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,767
你好  阿尔法  你声音真好笑
Hi, Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny.

489
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,938
我知道  我知道  你见着那鸟了吗
I know, I know! Have you seen the bird?

490
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,766
见到了  它现在是我的俘虏
Why, yes. The bird is my prisoner now.

491
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,317

Yeah, rght!

492
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,104
不可能  你在哪儿
Impossible. Where are you?

493
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,609
我和鸟在一起
I am here with the bird

494
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,443
我要把它带回去  然后你就会喜欢我的
And l will bring it back, and then you will like me.

495
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,949
-得挂了  -逗逗  你在和谁说话
- Gotta go. - Hey, Dug, who you talking to?

496
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,950
-等等  -逗逗在做什么
- No, wait, wait! - What's Dug doing?

497
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,872
他怎么和个小邮差在一起
Why is he with the small mailman?

498
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,575
他们在哪儿
Where are they?

499
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,962
找到他了  快来
There he is. Come on.!

500
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,303
求你了 求你了  做我的俘虏吧
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner.

501
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,800
逗逗  别再烦凯文了
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

502
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,803
那个人说我可以带走这鸟
That man there says I can take the bird,

503
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:50,638
而且我把他当作主人来爱
And I love that man there like he is my master.

504
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,810
我不是你的主人
I am not your master!

505
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,434
我再次警告你  鸟
I am warning you once again, bird.

506
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,515
-住手  -我压住你啦  鸟
- Hey! Quit it - I am jumping on you now bird.

507
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,896
罗索  照这样下去咱们永远也到不了瀑布
Russell, at this rate we'll never get to the falls.

508
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,318
跟我走
Here bird.

509
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,199
我谁的主人也不是  知道吗
I am nobody's Master, got it?

510
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,747
我不想再见到你 还有你
I don't want you here, and I don't want you here!

511
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,119
我被你缠上了
I'm stuck with you!

512
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,873
如果你俩不在我数到三之前消失
And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three...

513
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,500
球球  天啊  天啊  球球
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy, a ball!

514
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,004
球  你想要球
Ball? Yeah yeah? You want it, boy?

515
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,091
是的  超级想要
Yes, I do. I do ever so want the ball.

516
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,638
-去追吧  -天啊  太好了

我会追上它并叼回来
I will get it and then bring it back!

518
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,180
罗素  快给我点巧克力

520
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,138
鸟鸟

522
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,020
等一下  弗雷德里克森先生
Wait! Wait, Mr. Fredricksen!

523
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,951
我们到底要做什么
What are we doing?

524
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,165
咱们已经走好远了  凯文会找不到我的
Hey, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me.

525
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,801
应该已经甩掉他们了
I think that did the trick.

526
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,047
主人  您好
Hi, master.

527
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,223
下午好
Afternoon.

528
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,911
多亏你我们才不被淋湿  艾莉
Well, thanks for keeping us dry, anyway, Ellie.

529
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,871
哪根是前面呢
Which one is the front?

530
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:44,757
天啊
Oh, boy.

531
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:48,553
该第三步还是第五步了
Is this step three or step five?

532
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,090
好啦
There.

533
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,395
搭好啦  给你的
All done. That's for you.

534
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,396
搭帐篷真难
Tents are hard.

535
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,936
等等  你不是带着GPM和胸章
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,

536
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:13,202
的超级野外生存专家吗
With the GPMs and the badges?

537
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,998
是啊  不过  我能告诉你一个秘密吗
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

538
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,419
-不听 -好吧 我说了
- No. - All right. Here it goes.

539
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,464
我从未搭过帐篷  好了  我说了
I never actually built a tent before. There! I said it.

540
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,168
你好歹野过营吧
You've been camping before, haven't you?

541
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,719
从没在外面
Well, never outside.

542
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,636
那你为什么不问你爸爸怎么搭帐篷呢
Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent?

543
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,935
我想他不想和我说这些
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.

544
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,638
为什么不找机会问问他  也许他会教你
Why don't you try him sometime. Maybe he'll surprise you.

545
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,065
他经常不在家  我总见不到他
Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much.

546
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,767
他总有在家的时候
He's gotta be home sometime.

547
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:49,105
我打电话  但是菲丽丝说我总烦他
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.

548
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,613
菲丽丝  你直接叫你妈妈的名字吗
Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?

549
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,865
菲丽丝不是我妈妈
Phyllis isn't my mom.

550
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,425
但他答应参加我的探险家典礼
But he promised he'd come to my Explorers Ceremony

551
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,299
为我戴上"协助年长老人"胸章
To pin on my Assisting The Elderly Badge.

552
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,511
到时候他就能教我搭帐篷了  是吧
So, he can show me about tents then, right?

553
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,683
你该睡觉了
Hey, why don t you get some sleep?

554
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,604
不要惊动路过的跳蚤
Don't wanna wake up the traveling flea circus.

555
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,149
弗雷德里克森先生
Mr. Fredricksen,

556
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,111
逗逗说他要把凯文抓起来
Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner.

557
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,953
咱们必须得保护他
We have to protect him.

558
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,204
咱们可以带着凯文吗
Can Kevin go with us?

559
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,750
好吧  他可以跟着
All right, he can come.

560
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,541
保证你不会抛弃他
Promise you won't leave him?

561
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,168
-好  -你发誓
- Yeah. - Cross your heart?

562
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,265
我发誓
Cross my heart.

563
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,311
艾莉  我都做了什么蠢事啊
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

564
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,252
早安  亲爱的
Good morning, sweetheart.

565
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,014
咱们该启程了
We'd better get moving.

566
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,060
那鸟不见了
Bird's gone.

567
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,731
也许罗索不会发现  好啦  都起床
Maybe Russell won't notice. All right, everybody up!

568
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,458
凯文在哪儿  他跑丢了
Where's Kevin? He's wondered off!

569
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:52,028
凯文  逗逗  把凯文找回来
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

570
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,948
去找鸟  去找鸟  发现了
Find the bird, find the bird! Point!

571
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,900
看  他在那
Look! There he is.

572
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,491
发现了
Point!

573
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:05,537
那是我的食物  给我从屋顶上下来
Hey, that's my food! Get off my roof!

574
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:06,868
就是  从他的无顶上下来
Yeah, get off of his roof!

575
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,548
他在干什么
What is it doing?

576
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,048
那鸟在叫她的宝宝
The bird is calling to her babies.

577
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,637
她的宝宝
Her babies!

578
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,553
凯文是个女孩吗
Kevin is a girl?

579
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,680
她的家就在那边的乱石上
Her house s over there in those twisty rocks.

580
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,015
她在为宝宝们觅食
She has been gathering food for her babies

581
00:50:30,016 --> 00:50:31,359
现在该回去了
And must get back to them.

582
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,274
等等  凯文要走吗
Wait, Kevin is just leaving.

583
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,358
但是你保证了要保护她
But you promised to protect her.

584
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,741
她的宝宝需要她  咱们要护送她去团聚
Her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together.

585
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,868
抱歉  罗索  我们已经浪费够多时间了
Sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already.

586
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,451
是啊
Yeah.

587
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,843
这是她最喜欢的巧克力
This was her favorite chocolate.

588
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,512
你把她赶走了  剩下的都给你吧
Because you sent her away, there's more for you.

589
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,473
凯文
Kevin?

590
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,078
鸟呢  你说你抓住鸟了
Where's the bird? You said you had the bird!

591
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,375
是的  是的
Oh, yes, oh, yes.

592
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,499
我是说过  我也明白你是怎么想的
Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that.

593
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,674
-它在哪  -明天

来吧  把你的飞船系在我的旁边

634
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:59,460
我们不是要上"冒险精神"号里面吧
We are not actually going inside the Spirit of Adventure itself?

-你不准进  -我们怎么处置逗逗
- Not you! - What do we do with Dug?

我不喜欢"耻辱锥帽"

岁月总是在寻觅中就消逝了

不行  凯文  躺着别动
No, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

744
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:46,187
她伤得很重  能把她送回家吗
She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?

745
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,749
好吧  但要动作快
All right, but we gotta hurry.

746
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,874
你跟丢了
You lost them?

747
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,129
不是  逗逗妨碍我们了
No, it was Dug.

748
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,553
没错  他们是一伙的  还帮他们逃跑
Yeah. He's with them. He helped them escape!

749
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:14,972
等等
Wait.

750
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,471
等一下  可以追踪逗逗
Wait a minute. Dug.

751
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,601
有人跟来吗
See anything?

752
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,153
没有  我的同伴没追来  一群笨狗
No, my pack is not following us. Boy, they are dumb.

753
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,689
真疯狂
This is crazy.

754
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,328
我自小仰慕的英雄
I finally meet my chidlhood hero,

755
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:34,368
居然追杀我们  真是笑话
And he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

756
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,819
我知道个笑话
Hey, I know a joke.

757
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,820
一只松鼠爬到树上说
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

758
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,120
"我忘记准备过冬粮  所以现在要挂了"
"I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead".

759
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,544
笑点是  松鼠挂了
Ha! It s funny because the squirrel gets dead.

760
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,874
当心点  罗索
Careful, Russell.

761
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,550
凯文  你没事吧
You okay, Kevin?

762
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,884
弗莱德里克森先生  你知道吗
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

763
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,845
野外生活跟我的预想大相径庭
The wilderness isn't quite what I expected.

764
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,562
那又如何
Yeah? How so?

765
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,141
真是  太狂野了
It's kind of wild.

766
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,902
跟我看的书差远了
I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.

767
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,900
习惯就好了  孩子
Get used to that, kid.

768
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,403
我爸爸说得轻巧
My dad made it sound so easy.

769
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,576
他是露营能手
He is really good at camping,

770
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,746
还会钻木取火
And how to make fire from rocks and stuff

771
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,540
凡是我的小组会议  他都会出席
He used to come to all my squad lodge meetings.

772
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:26,499
开完会以后  我们会去吃雪糕
And afterwards, we go get icecream that fattens.

773
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,748
我吃巧克力味  他吃脆心香草味
I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle.

774
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,801
然后我们一起坐在马路边
Then we sit on this one curb, right outside

775
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,721
我数蓝色的车  他数红色的车
And I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones,

776
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,388
谁数的最多就算赢
And whoever gets the most wins.

777
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,892
我喜欢那个路边
I like that curve.

778
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,897
虽然听着无聊
It might sound boring,

779
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:54,440
但这些事我记得最深刻
But I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.

780
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,789
瞧  就在那里
Look, there it is!

781
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,957
等等  罗索  别动
Hold on, Russell, stand still.

782
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:22,142
瞧那鸟高兴的  慢点  你这只变异的鸡
Look at that bird go! Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

783
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,177
就是那里 去吧 凯文
That's it! Go, Kevin!

784
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:26,896
找你的孩子去
Go find your babies!

785
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,277
快跑  凯文  快逃
Run, Kevin, run!

786
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,448
不  不
Oh, no!

787
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,906
罗索  把你的刀给我
Russell, give me your knife!

788
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,911
别碰我的鸟
Get away from my bird!

789
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,313
不
No!

790
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,241
不
No!

791
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,497
当心点  我要带个完好无损的回去
Careful, I want it in good shape for my return.

792
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,213
放了她  别走
Let her go! Stop!

793
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,969
凯文
Kevin!

794
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,485
你让他们把凯文抓走了
You gave away Kevin.

795
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,161
你就这么丢下她
You just gave her away.

796
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,628
这不关我的事  
This is none of my concern. 

797
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:12,586
这些都不是我想要的
I didn't ask for any of these!

798
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,000
主人  没事的
Master, it's all right.

799
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,710
我不是你的主人
I am not your master!

800
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,548
如果不是你  这些事根本不会发生
If you hadn't have shown up, none of these would have happened.

801
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,925
你这坏狗  死狗
Bad dog! Bad dog!

802
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,360
不管你帮不帮忙
Now, whether you assist me or not,

803
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,448
即使拼了命  我都要去天堂瀑布
I am going to paradise falls, if it kills me!

804
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:57,440
都给你  我不要了
Here. I don't want this anymore.

805
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,157

我躲在你的门廊下面  因为我敬爱你
I was hiding under your porch because I love you.

812
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:14,207
我能留下吗
Can I stay?

813
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,713
还用问吗  你是我的狗  对吧
Can you stay? Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

814
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,135
我是你的主人
And I'm your master.

815
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,720
你愿意当我的主人
You're my master?

816
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:21,138
天啊  太好了
Oh boy! Oh boy!

817
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,009
好孩子  逗逗  你是个好孩子
Good boy, Dug! You're a good boy!

818
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:50,952
好极了
Yes!

819
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,796
别怕  凯文  我来救你
Don't worry, Kevin, I'll save...

820
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,004
他们不相信我
And they wouldn't believe me.

821
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:08,762
等到他们看到你肯定会大跌眼镜的
Just wait till they get a look at you!

822
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,096
主人
Master.

823

-那个小邮差闯进来了  -什么

Where is your elderly friend?

826
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,534
他才不是我的朋友
He's not my friend anymore.

你来了  弗雷德里克森也不会跑远
Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind.

没人会理你的
None of your mailmen friends can hear you.
