那梦境是他们很少见到的

他们的王国能够统一

是她头发的颜色

65
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:23,572
嘴唇是那红色玫瑰羞愧的唇
Lips that shame the red, red rose

00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:26,365
她将随着春季走

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,117
无论她去到哪
Wherever she goes

68
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,913
小公主...
Tiny princess...

69
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:43,122
我的礼物是，歌曲
my gift shall be the gift of song.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,668
一份礼物
One gift

71
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:56,878

她的梦中情人

带他悦耳的小夜曲到她的门

75
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:28,766
可爱的公主，我的礼物是--
Sweet princess, my gift shall be the--

76
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,195
- 是巫婆莫力菲森 - 她来这干什么?
- Why, it's Maleficent. - What does she want here? - Shh!

77
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,030
嗯，相当耀眼的聚会，斯蒂芬国王
Well, quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan.

78
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:04,283
皇室，高贵的...
Royalty, nobility...

79
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:07,033
贵族，还有--
the gentry, and--

80
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,868
很有趣，甚至还有乌合之众
How quaint. Even the rabble.

81
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,662
没有受到邀请真的让我感到非常哀伤
I really felt quite distressed at not receiving an invitation.

82
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,706
- 你妄想 - 别这么说--
- You weren't wanted. - Not wa--

83
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:25,208
噢，亲爱的，很难堪吧
Oh, dear, what an awkward situation.

84
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:28,626
我很希望这仅仅是因为疏忽
I had hoped it was merely due to some oversight.

85
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,335
如果是那样，我可以不怪罪你们
Well, in that event, I'd best be on my way.

86
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,003
我们没有得罪你吧，阁下？
And you're not offended, Your Excellency?

87
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:38,796
为什么，不，皇后
Why, no, Your Majesty.

88
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,715
为了表示我没有恶意...
And to show I bear no ill will...

89
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:45,382
我也会给一份礼物给孩子
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

90
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:49,718
你们所有人好好听着
Listen well, all ofyou.

91
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:56,804
公主的确会在大家的爱戴下...
The princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty...

92
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,764
优美和美丽里成长
beloved by all who know her.

93
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,974
但是...
But...

94
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:07,725
在她16岁生日那天...
before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday...

95
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:12,561
她将在一个纺车的纱锭上扎破她的手指...
she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel...

96
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:14,229
然后死去
and die.

97
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:16,896
噢，不要
Oh, no!

98
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,063
抓住那个巫婆!
Seize that creature!

99
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,523
退后，你们这些白痴!
Stand back, you fools!

100
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,404
别绝望，皇后
Don't despair, Your Majesties.

101
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,321
玛莉怀德还有一份礼物没给
Merryweather still has her gift to give.

102
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:41,699
那么她能破解这个可怕的诅咒吗?
Then she can undo this fearful curse?

103
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,450
噢，不，陛下
Oh, no, Sire.

104
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,701
这个巫婆的力量太大
Maleficent's powers are far too great.

105
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:49,368
但她能帮助
But she can help.

106
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,454
- 但是-- - 尽你所能，宝贝
- But-- - Just do your best, dear.

107
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,829
是的，去吧
Yes, go on.

108
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:58,663
小公主...
Sweet princess...

109
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,415
据这个邪恶的巫婆说...
if through this wicked witch's trick...

110
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,958
你的手指会被一个纱锭扎破...
a spindle should your finger prick...

111
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,251
或许这仍有一点希望...
a ray of hope there still may be in this...

112
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,252
我给你的礼物
the gift I give to thee.

113
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:13,003
不会死，你只是会在这个
Not in death, but just in sleep...

114
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:15,504
致命的预言下沉睡...
the fateful prophecy you'll keep.

115
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:17,963
当你得到真爱的吻时，魔咒就会破解...
And from this slumber you shall wake...

116
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,466
你也会在沉睡中醒来
when true love's kiss the spell shall break.

117
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,217
真爱
Fortrue love

118
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:32,136
战胜一切
Conquers all

119
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:37,972
但是斯蒂芬国王，仍然担心她女儿的生命...
But King Stefan, still fearful of his daughter's life...

120
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:42,016
所以他颁令所有王国内的手纺车轮...
did then and there decree that every spinning wheel in the kingdom...

121
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,058
在那天都要被烧毁
should on that very day be burned.

122
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:47,517
即刻生效
So 'twas done.

123
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:06,485
噢，愚蠢的举动！
Oh, silly fiddle-faddle!

124
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,028
现在，来一杯香浓的茶，亲爱的
Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.

125
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:13,321
我确信总有解决的办法
I'm sure it'll work out somehow.

126
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:16,363
大火并不能阻止巫婆的诅咒
Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.

127
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:18,615
当然不会，但什么能阻止？
Of course not. But what will?

128
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:21,616
- 或许我们可以跟她评理 - 理由呢?
- Well, perhaps ifwe reason with her. - Reason?

129
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,659
- 和巫婆? - 她不会穷凶极恶的
- With Maleficent? - Well, she can't be all bad.

130
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,701
噢，她就是这么一个人
Oh, yes, she can!

131
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:31,454
噢，我真想把她变成又胖又老的蟾蜍
Ooh, I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hoptoad.

132
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:34,747
亲爱的，这可不是你说想做就能做到的
Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say.

133
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,331
我们没有这个能力 你知道我们的魔法有限
Besides, we can't. You know our magic doesn't work that way.

134
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:41,875
我们只能带来欢乐与幸福
It can only do good, dear, to bring joy and happiness.

135
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,083
那样做会使我很快乐
Well, that would make me happy.

136
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,793
但是一定有什么办法的
But there must be some way.

137
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:50,294
- 有了! - 有了?
- There is! - There is?

138
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:53,463
- 是什么，弗洛拉? - 我将--
- What is it, Flora? - I'm going to--

139
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,130
嘘，嘘，嘘! 小心隔墙有耳
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! Even walls have ears.

140
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:04,343
跟我来
Follow me.

141
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:20,849
我要把她变成一朵花
I'll turn her into a flower.

142
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:24,434
- 巫婆吗? - 不是，亲爱的，是公主
- Maleficent? - Oh, no, dear. The princess.

143
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:27,102
噢，她将变成一朵可爱的花
Oh, she'd make a lovely flower.

144
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:29,937
你想想，一朵花哪来的手指？
Don't you see? A flower can't prick its finger.

145
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,395
- 没有 - 那就对了
- It hasn't any. - That's right.

146
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,481
- 她将会很安全 - 直到巫婆送来一次霜害
- She'll be perfectly safe. - Until Maleficent sends a frost.

147
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:40,232
是啊！噢，亲爱的
Yes! Eh-- Oh, dear.

148
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:43,609
她始终会毁灭你那朵可爱的花
She always ruins your nicest flowers.

149
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:48,028
是的，她一定正希望我们做些那样的事呢
You're right. And she'll be expecting us to do something like that.

150
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:53,238
噢！那么，什么才不是她希望的？她知道一切
Oh! Well, what won't she expect? She knows everything.

151
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,322
不，不会的
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

152
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:58,157
巫婆对于爱情...
Maleficent doesn't know anything about love...

153
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,909
亲情或者是幸福快乐，一窍不通
or kindness or the joy of helping others.

154
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,493
有时我并不认为她真的很快乐
You know, sometimes I don't think she's really very happy.

155
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,370
当然，正是那样
That's it! Of course.

156
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:13,038
只有这些她才不能理解和预知
It's the only thing she can't understand and won't expect.

157
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,332
现在，现在，我们要小心谨慎的计划
Now, now, now, we'll have to plan it carefully.

158
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:21,333
让我想想...砍柴者的农舍 是的，是的，废弃了的农舍
Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage. Yes, yes, the abandoned one.

159
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,876
当然国王和皇后会反对
Of course, the king and queen will object.

160
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,460
但我们会解释这是唯一的办法--
But when we explain it's the only way--

161
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,629
解释什么?
Explain what?

162
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:33,546
关于3个农妇养大一个弃孩...
About the three peasant women raising a foundling child...

163
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:35,839
在森林的深处
deep in the forest.

164
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:40,550
- 哦？他们心肠太好了 - 他们是谁?
- Oh? Oh, that's very nice of them. - Who are they?

165
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,510
转身
Turn around.

166
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:46,344
- 咦! - 为什么是我们！
- Eww! - Why, it's us!

167
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:49,262
- 啊 - 你的意思是，我们?
- Uh-huh. - You mean, "we" us?

168
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,346
- 嗯 - 照顾孩子?
- Uh-huh. - Take care of the baby?

169
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,181
- 为什么不呢? - 噢，我愿意!
- Why not? - Oh, I'd like that!

170
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,682
但是，我们得喂她吃饭--
Well, y-yes, but w-w-we'd have to feed it a--

171
00:13:57,766 --> 00:14:01,226
还有洗衣服穿衣服哄她睡觉
And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep.

172
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:04,268
- 噢，我喜欢 - 你真的认为我们能吗?
- Oh, I'd love it. - Do you really think we can?

173
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,519
人类可以，我们也可以
If humans can do it, so can we.

174
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:10,021
- 我们还有魔法可以帮助我们 - 是的
- And we'd have our magic to help us. - That's right.

175
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:13,398
不，不，不，不! 不许用魔法!
No, no, no, no, no, no! No magic!

176
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,773
我要拿走这些魔法棒
I'll take those wands right now.

177
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:18,358
最好也除去那些翅膀
Oh, better get rid of those wings too.

178
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,567
你是说像凡人一样生活16年?
You mean live like mortals? For sixteen years?

179
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:26,361
但是，现在，我们不知道行不行的通--
- Uh-huh. - B-Bu-- Now, now, we-- we don't know how.

180
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,362
没有了魔法我们什么也不能做
We've never done anything without magic.

181
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:30,821
这可以让巫婆不会怀疑--
And that's why Maleficent will never suspect--

182
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,822
- 但是，但是，谁来洗衣服? - 还有做饭?
- But-- But who'll wash? - And cook?

183
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,990
- 噢，我们大家一起努力 - 我来照顾孩子
- Oh, we'll all pitch in. - I'll take care of the baby.

184
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,950
给我，亲爱的
Let me have it, dear.

185
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:43,034
跟我来，我们必须立刻告诉国王
Come along now. We must tell Their Majesties at once.

186
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:49,246
- 弗洛拉? - 弗洛拉?
- Flora? - Flora?

187
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:58,542
所以国王和他的皇后怀着沉重的心情...
So the king and his queen watched with heavy hearts...

188
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,167
看着他们唯一的最宝贵的女儿...
as their most precious possession, their only child...

189
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:04,502
在那个夜晚消失
disappeared into the night.

190
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:19,884
斯蒂芬国王和他的百姓...
Many sad and lonely years passed by...

191
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:23,510
在悲哀和孤单中度过多年
for King Stefan and his people.

192
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:27,720
但当公主16岁的生日邻近的时候...
But as the time for the princess' sixteenth birthday drew near...

193
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:31,555
整个王国开始欣喜若狂
the entire kingdom began to rejoice.

194
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,223
因为众所周知，只要巫婆的领域...
For everyone knew that as long as Maleficent's domain...

195
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:39,976
那座禁止的山，因为她的暴怒和挫折发出如雷之声...
the Forbidden Mountains, thundered with her wrath and frustration...

196
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:43,144
她邪恶的预言就不会实现
her evil prophecy had not yet been fulfilled.

197
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:57,525
难以置信！
It's incredible!

198
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:01,484
16年了，居然一点消息也没有
Sixteen years, and not a trace of her.

199
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,903
她不会消失得无影无踪 !
She couldn't have vanished into thin air!

200
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:08,988
你们确信每一处地方都搜查过了?
Are you sure you searched everywhere?

201
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,406
是的，是的，都搜查过了
Yes, yes, uh, everywhere.

202
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,489
- 我们都搜查过了 - 是的，是的！
- We all did. - Yeah, yeah!

203
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,657
是的
Uh-huh, yeah.

204
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,534
市镇呢? 森林? 深山?
And what about the town? The forest? The mountains?

205
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:21,827
是的，我们搜查过深山 嗯，森林...
Yeah, we searched mountains, uh, uh, uh, uh, forests...

206
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,536
还有，住宅，还有--
and, uh, houses, and, uh--

207
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,496
让我想想，还有所有的摇篮
Let me see. Uh, and all the cradles.

208
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,998
- 摇篮? - 是的
- Cradle? - Yep, yep.

209
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,206
每个摇篮
Every cradle.

210
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,791
摇篮?
Cradle?

211
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,458
你听到了吗，我的宝贝?
Did you hear that, my pet?

212
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:43,295
这些年来，他们一直在寻找一个婴儿
All these years, they've been looking for a baby.

213
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:57,508
傻瓜!
Fools!

214
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:00,677
白痴! 笨蛋!
Idiots! Imbeciles!

215
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,017
噢，他们不可救药了
Oh, they're hopeless.

216
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:21,685
这简直是邪恶势力的耻辱
A disgrace to the forces of evil.

217
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:28,355
宝贝，你是我最后的希望了
My pet, you are my last hope.

218
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,189
到处飞一下
Circle far and wide.

219
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:33,941
搜查一个16岁的少女...
Search for a maid of sixteen...

220
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,358
有着金黄色的头发...
with hair of sunshine gold...

221
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:39,235
和玫瑰红色的嘴唇
and lips red as the rose.

222
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,861
去吧，别让我失望
Go, and do not fail me.

223
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:50,614
16年来...
And so, for sixteen long years...

224
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:54,116
公主的行踪一直保持的很神秘
the whereabouts of the princess remained a mystery.

225
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,326
在森林深处的一座砍柴者的农舍内...
While deep in the forest in a woodcutter's cottage...

226
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,202
那些仙女正在执行她们安排得很好的计划
the good fairies carried out their well-laid plan.

227
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:04,995
象凡人一样生活，她们对她就像自己的孩子那样养育...
Living like mortals, they had reared the child as their own...

228
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,497
她们叫她布莱尔罗丝
and called her Briar Rose.

229
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,000
今天，她16岁的生日...
On this, her sixteenth birthday...

230
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,335
仙女们打算办一个舞会...
the good fairies had planned a party...

231
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:21,461
给她一个意想不到的惊喜
and something extra special for a surprise.

232
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,629
- 那么，这个呢? - 这个是我选的
- Well, now, how about this one? - This is the one I picked.

233
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,755
噢，她穿起来一定很漂亮
Oh, she'll look beautiful in that.

234
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,298
- 我认为这应该做点改变
- Now, I thought a few changes here. - Uh-huh.

235
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:32,965
- 别忘了一漂亮的弓 - 是的，举起这肩线
- And don't forget a pretty bow. - Yes, and raise the shoulder line.

236
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,425
- 我们把它做成蓝色的 - 不，还是粉红色
- We'll make it blue. - Oh, no, dear, pink.

237
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,426
- 但是-- - 当然，我们得需要少许褶
- But-- - Of course, we'll need a few pleats.

238
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,886
但是我们怎样让她离开这个房子?
Yes, but how are we gonna get her out of the house?

239
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,094
我在考虑
Oh, I'll think of something.

240
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,971
你们三个一直在干什么?
Well, and what are you three dears up to?

241
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:48,181
-什么?
- Up to? - Up to? - Up to?

242
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,640
我们，我们--
Well, we-- Uh, we-- W-We--

243
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:56,684
- 我们想你去采些浆果 - 对，浆果！
- We want you to pick some berries. - That's it, berries!

244
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,144
- 浆果? - 很多浆果
- Berries? - Lots of berries.

245
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:03,353
- 但我昨天已经采过浆果了 - 噢，我们还需要，亲爱的
- But I-I picked berries yesterday. - Oh, w-we need more, dear.

246
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:06,481
- 很多，很多 - 是的!
- Lots, lots more. - Yes!

247
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,982
- 别急着回来，亲爱的 - 但也别走太远了
- Now don't hurry back, dear. - But don't go too far.

248
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:13,483
- 别和陌生人讲话 - 再见，亲爱的
- And don't speak to strangers. - Goodbye, dear.

249
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:17,027
再见!
- Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye!

250
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,987
- 我想知道她是否怀疑了 - 当然没有
- I wonder if she suspects. - Of course not.

251
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,405
来吧，她会惊喜的
Come on! Oh, will she be surprised.

252
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:27,572
一个生日宴会
A real birthday party.

253
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:29,615
还有生日蛋糕
With a real birthday cake.

254
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:32,575
一件服装一位公主，够让我们骄傲了
Yes, and a dress a princess can be proud of.

255
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:36,826
- 我去拿魔法棒 - 好的，噢，魔法棒？
- I'll get the wands. - Yes, you can, uh-- The wands?

256
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:39,703
- 不要 - 不许用魔法！
- Oh, no! - No magic!

257
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,162
但是16年马上就要过去了
But the sixteen years are almost over.

258
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,413
我们要以防万一
We're taking no chances.

259
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:47,414
但我从未烤过奇特的蛋糕
But I've never baked a fancy cake.

260
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,540
你不必烤那样的蛋糕，亲爱的
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

261
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,749
我去烤蛋糕
I'm going to bake the cake.

262
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,501
- 你? - 她早就就想烤了
- You? - Oh, she's always wanted to, dear.

263
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,001
- 这是她最后的机会
- And this is her last chance. - Well--

264
00:19:57,085 --> 00:20:00,878
我将要用粉红色和蓝色的勿忘我烤个15层的蛋糕
I'm going to make it fifteen layers with pink and blue forget-me-nots.

265
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:03,379
我去做衣服
And I'm making the dress.

266
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:06,506
但你不会缝制，她也从未烤过蛋糕
But you can't sew, and she's never cooked.

267
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,382
- 很简单！ - 照着这本书做就行了
- Oh-ho-ho, it's simple! - All you do is follow the book.

268
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:14,300
站上来，亲爱的，你暂时做会模特
Up here, dear. You can be the dummy.

269
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:17,885
该我说我们还是应该使用魔法
Well, I still say we ought to use magic.

270
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,264
"面粉，三杯"
"Flour, three cups."

271
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:30,350
杯子，杯子，杯子...
Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups.

272
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:33,267
噢
Oh.

273
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:36,519
一，二，三
One, two, three.

274
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,603
- 这用来干什么? - 它在底部要有一个洞
- What's that for? - Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom.

275
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:44,105
那是为了脚能穿过
That's for the feet to go through.

276
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,608
- 它是粉色的 - 喔，可爱的图案，不是吗?
- It's pink. - Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

277
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,359
- 但我喜欢蓝色的 - 现在，亲爱的...
- But I wanted it blue. - Now, dear...

278
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:55,652
我们决定粉色作为她的颜色
we decided pink was her colour.

279
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:58,819
你说了算!
You decided!

280
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:13,700
"两个鸡蛋，逐渐的拌入"
"Two eggs. Fold in gently."

281
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,410
压碎？喔，好的
Fold? Uh, oh, well.

282
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:24,039
我不能呼吸了!
I can't breathe!

283
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:26,790
让我出去
Let me out of here.

284
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,125
- 看起来很可怕 - 那是因为穿在你身上，亲爱的
- It looks awful. - That's because it's on you, dear.

285
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,627
"现在，一茶匙发酵粉" "茶匙"?
"Now, yeast, one tsp." "Tsp."?

286
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,961
一茶匙
One teaspoon.

287
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:41,046
- 当然，一茶匙 - 嗯!
- Oh, one teaspoon, of course! - Hmm!

288
00:21:47,383 --> 00:21:50,842
喔，那孩子长的真快
Oh, gracious, how that child has grown.

289
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:54,260
好像我们昨天才带她来这似的
Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here.

290
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:57,053
只是一个婴儿
Just a tiny baby.

291
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:03,889
- 怎么了，玛莉怀德 - 究竟怎么了，亲爱的?
- Why, Merryweather. - What ever is the matter, dear?

292
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:06,473
过了今天，她就要成为一位公主了...
After today, she'll be a princess...

293
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,392
我们不会再有布莱尔罗丝了
and we won't have any Briar Rose.

294
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,767
- 噢，弗洛拉! - 现在，现在...
- Oh, Flora! - Now, now, now, now.

295
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:15,560
我们，我们都知道这一天迟早会到来
Well, we-- we all knew this day had to come.

296
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:18,396
但为什么要来的这么快呢?
But why did it have to come so soon?

297
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:22,522
毕竟，我们拥有她16年
After all, we've had her for sixteen years.

298
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:25,023
美好的16年
Sixteen wonderful years.

299
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:31,901
我们的所做正如许多的傻子所为
Oh, gracious! We're acting like a lot of ninnies.

300
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,902
快点，否则我们准备好之前她会回来的
Come on. She'll be back before we get started.

301
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:25,074
你听见了吗，参森？
You hear that, Samson?

302
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:27,616
很动听
Beautiful.

303
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,952
谁在唱?
What is it?

304
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:36,620
来吧，我们去探个究竟
Come on. Let's find out.

305
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:40,247
喔，别这样 额外的一桶燕麦？
Aw, come on. For an extra bucket of oats?

306
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:45,125
再加一些胡萝卜?
And a few carrots?

307
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,584
驾!
Hup, boy!

308
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:19,598
哇哦
Whoa!

309
00:25:31,603 --> 00:25:33,936
别再想吃胡萝卜
No carrots.

310
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:49,402
我想知道
I wonder

311
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:52,904
我想知道

312
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:57,280
我想知道为什么每只小鸟
I wonder why each little bird

313
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,989
有某人
Has a someone

314
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:03,158
来歌唱那
To sing to

315
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:06,451
美好事物
Sweet things to

316
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:11,952
一首快活的小爱曲
A gay little love melody

317
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:17,623
我想知道
I wonder

318
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,582
我想知道

319
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:24,291
如果我的心一直唱歌
Ifmy heart keeps singing

320
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:28,084
我的歌声会飞向
Will my song go winging

321
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,462
某人
To someone

322
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:35,087
一个会找到我的人
Who 'll find me

323
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:40,632
然后他也会对我
And bring back a love song

324
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:44,967
唱情歌
To me

325
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,927
噢，亲爱的
Oh, dear.

326
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:55,846
为什么她们仍然把我看作是小孩呢?
Why do they still treat me like a child?

327
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:59,348
谁?
Who?

328
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:03,558
弗洛拉，弗娜还有玛莉怀德阿姨
Aunt Flora and Fauna and Merryweather.

329
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:08,602
她们从不让我接触任何人
They never want me to meet anyone.

330
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:14,937
但是你知道吗?
But you know something?

331
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:17,230
我骗了她们
I fooled them.

332
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:19,940
我接触过某人
I have met someone.

333
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:21,815
谁?
Who?

334
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:27,026
谁? 谁?
Who? Who?

335
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,070
一位王子
Oh, a prince.

336
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:36,197
他高大英俊，还有--
Well, he's tall and handsome and--

337
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,281
很浪漫
and so romantic.

338
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:45,785
我们一起散布一起聊天
Oh, we walk together and talk together.

339
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:49,036
在我们说再见之前...
And just before we say goodbye...

340
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,995
他拥抱我...
he takes me in his arms...

341
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,289
然后...
and then...

342
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:57,664
我醒来了
I wake up.

343
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,125
是的，这只是我的一个梦
Yes, it's only in my dreams.

344
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:06,960
但据说如果你反覆梦见同一个梦...
But they say ifyou dream a thing more than once...

345
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:09,169
它就一定会实现...
it's sure to come true...

346
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:12,671
我见过他多次
and I've seen him so many times.

347
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,064
你知道，参森...
You know, Samson...

348
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:59,941
那声音有点怪异
there was something strange about that voice.

349
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:03,609
简直是完美无暇
Too beautiful to be real.

350
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:07,861
或许是一些神秘的精灵，像树精或者--
Maybe it was some mysterious being, a wood sprite or a--

351
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,988
放下！
Here, stop!

352
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:45,752
怎么回事，是我梦想中的王子
Why, it's my dream prince.

353
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:51,922
王子殿下
Your Highness.

354
00:29:57,716 --> 00:30:00,884
我真的不允许对陌生人说话...
You know, I'm really not supposed to speak to strangers...

355
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,343
但是我们以前见过
but we've met before.

356
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,927
我认识你
I knowyou

357
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:11,554
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you once upon a dream

358
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:14,265
我认识你
I knowyou

359
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,473
你的眼神
The gleam in your eyes

360
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:19,850
是如此熟悉的眼神
Is so familiar a gleam

361
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:23,434
但我知道是真实的
Yet I know it's true

362
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,271
那梦境是他们很少见到的
That visions are seldom all they seem

363
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:30,854
但如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

364
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:33,439
我知道你会做什么
I know what you'll do

365
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:36,732
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

366
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:44,235
在那个梦里你会这么做
The wayyou did once upon a dream

367
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:55,532
但是如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

368
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:58,533
我知道你会做什么
I know what you'll do

369
00:30:58,617 --> 00:31:01,451
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

370
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:03,451
你会这么做
- The wayyou-- - The wayyou did

371
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:08,287
在那个梦里
Once upon a dream

372
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:12,205
噢! 噢!
Oh! Oh!

373
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,624
非常抱歉 我并不想吓到你
I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

374
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,208
噢，不是这样的
Oh, it, uh, wasn't that.

375
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:21,001
不过你是一个--
It's just that you're a-- a--

376
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,293
- 陌生人? - 嗯亨
- A stranger? - Mm-hmm.

377
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:26,087
但你忘了? 我们以前见过
But don't you remember? We've met before.

378
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,671
- 我们见过? - 是的，当然，你自己说的
- We-- We have? - Well, of course. You said so yourself.

379
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,630
曾经在一个梦里
Once upon a dream.

380
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,298
我认识你
I knowyou

381
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:40,134
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you once upon a dream

382
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:42,969
我认识你

383
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:49,054
你的眼神是如此的熟悉
The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam

00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:55,599
我知道这是真实的
Yet I know it's true

385
00:31:55,683 --> 00:32:01,476
那梦境是他们很少见到的
That visions are seldom all they seem

386
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:04,979
但是如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

I know what you'll do

388
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:11,148
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

389
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:13,898
你所做的
The wayyou did

390
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:22,653
在那个梦里
Once upon a dream

391
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,447
你是谁?
Who are you?

392
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,823
你叫什么?
What's your name?

393
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:35,032
嗯？?
Hmm?

噢，我的名字
Oh, my name.

00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,535
是--
Why, it's-- it's--

396
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:43,411
噢，不，不，我不能--
Oh, no, no, I can't! I--

397
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,745
- 再见! - 我什么时候能再见到你?
- Goodbye! - But when will I see you again?

398
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,496
- 不会了!不会再见！ - 不会再见?
- Oh, never! Never! - Never?

399
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:53,373
- 或许有一天 - 什么时候？明天？
- Well, maybe someday. - When? Tomorrow?

400
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:56,208
不！今晚！
Oh, no! This evening!

401
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:59,710
- 哪里? - 幽谷的农舍里
- Where? - At the cottage in the glen.

402
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,964
那里，噢!
There. Ooh!

403
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:19,927
- 这个蛋糕怎么样? - 怎么回事，它--
- Well, what do you think of it? - Why, it's--

404
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:23,095
一个与众不同的蛋糕，不是吗？
It's a very unusual cake, isn't it?

405
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:27,346
是的。把它烤烤会变的更硬
Yes. Of course, it'll be much stiffer after it's baked.

406
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,431
当然，亲爱的。嗯，你认为衣服怎么样?
Of course, dear. Um, what do you think of the dress?

407
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:33,515
嗯，它--
Well, it's, uh--

408
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,184
看起来并没有书上那样漂亮，是吗?
I-It's not exactly the way it is in the book, is it?

409
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:39,310
噢，我改进
Oh, I improved it.

410
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:43,937
不过，也许我可以加一些褶，啊，啊，你觉得怎么样？
But perhaps if I added a few more ruffles, uh-- Uh, what do you think?

411
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:49,064
嗯，我同意。你觉得呢，玛莉怀德？
Um, I think so. What do you think, Merryweather?

412
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:53,065
我觉得我们已经够多的废话了
I think we've had enough of this nonsense!

413
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,735
我们应该考虑一下罗丝她会对这些怎么想。
I think we ought to think of Rose and what she'll think of this mess.

414
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:00,402
我还是跟以前想的一样
I still think what I thunk before.

415
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,028
我去拿魔法棒
I'm going to get those wands.

416
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:08,739
我认为，她是对的。
You know, I think she's right.

417
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:11,157
在这了，好像新的一样
Here they are, good as new.

418
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,408
小心！玛莉怀德
Ah, ah, ah! C-C-C-C-C-Careful, Merryweather!

419
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:18,410
快，锁上门
Quick, lock the doors.

420
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:23,329
弗娜，你去关上窗 噢，堵上所有的漏缝
Uh, Fauna, you close the windows. Oh, block up every cranny.

421
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:26,830
我们不能冒险
We can't take any chances.

422
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:29,456
现在你看着那些蛋糕
Now, you take care of the cake.

423
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,916
在我清理房间的时候。
- While I-- - Clean the room, dear.

424
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:35,459
我会弄好衣服的。马上！
And I'll make the dress. Now hurry!

425
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,626
噢
Ooh!

426
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,336
来吧，水桶，拖把，扫帚
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.

427
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,004
弗洛拉说要打扫房间。
Flora says clean up the room.

428
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,300
现在做一件漂亮的衣服...
And now to make a lovely dress...

429
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,218
适合一位优雅高贵的公主
fit to grace a fair princess.

430
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:03,429
蛋，面粉，一点--
Eggs, flour, minute--

431
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:07,680
按照书里说的那样做，我会放上蜡烛
Just do it like it says here in the book. I'll put on the candles.

432
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,414
噢，不会吧，不要粉红色的，蓝色吧
Oh, no, not pink. Make it blue.

433
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,374
玛莉怀德，做成粉红色。
Merryweather! Make it pink.

434
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,918
蓝色。
Make it blue.

435
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,044
噢，粉红色。
Oh, pink!

436
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:24,214
蓝色。
Blue.

437
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,195
噢，你看看你做了什么
Ohh, now look what you've done!

438
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,946
嘘！听听
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

439
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,906
- 是罗丝 - 她回来了。这些胡闹的事够了
- It's Rose. - She's back. Enough of this foolishness.

440
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,660
做成粉红色的。马上藏起来，快！
Make it pink. Now hide, quick!

441
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,671
- 蓝色 - 弗洛拉！
- Blue. - Aunt Flora!

442
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:43,801
啊，谁让拖把还在动的？
Good gracious! Who left the mop running?

443
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:46,804
停下来，拖把
Stop, mop.

444
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:51,308
弗洛拉阿姨！弗娜！
Aunt Flora! Fauna!

445
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:53,811
玛莉怀德!
Merryweather!

446
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:59,983
人都去哪里了？噢！
Where is everybody? Oh!

447
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,402
惊喜！惊喜！
- Surprise! Surprise! - Surprise! Surprise! - Surprise!

448
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:05,655
- 生日快乐！ - 噢，亲爱的！
- Happy birthday! - Oh, you darlings!

449
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:08,366
这是我一生中最快乐的一天！
This is the happiest day of my life.

450
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,785
一切都是那么美好！
Everything's so wonderful.

451
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:13,996
- 等一下他！ - 他？
- Just wait 'til you meet him. - Him?

452
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:18,084
- 罗丝！ - 你约了一个陌生人？
- Rose! - Y-You've met some stranger?

453
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:21,546
他不是陌生人，我们以前认识的
Oh, he's not a stranger. We've met before.

454
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,839
- 是吗？ - 哪里？
- You have? - Where?

455
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:26,341
在一次梦里
Once upon a dream.

456
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:28,719
我认识你
I knowyou

457
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:34,766
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you once upon a dream

458
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:37,436
- 她恋爱了。 - 噢，不会吧。
- She's in love! - Oh, no.

459
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,855
太可怕了
This is terrible.

460
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:43,191
为什么？毕竟，我十六岁了
Why? After all, I am sixteen.

461
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:46,861
- 不是这样的，亲爱的 - 你已经订婚了
- It isn't that, dear. - You're already betrothed.

462
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:49,655
- 订婚了？ - 就在你出生的时候。
- Betrothed? - Since the day you were born.

463
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,701
- 嫁给菲利普王子 - 但是，这不可能的
- To Prince Phillip, dear. - But that's impossible.

464
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:56,704
我怎么会嫁给一个王子？ 我应该是......
How could I marry a prince? I'd have to be--

465
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:59,290
- 一个公主 - 你是的，亲爱的。
- A princess. - And you are, dear.

466
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:01,500
奥罗拉公主。
Princess Aurora.

467
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:05,379
今天晚上，我们会送你回到你的父亲斯蒂芬国王身边
Tonight, we're taking you back to your father, King Stefan.

468
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,922
但是，我不能回去
But-- But I can't.

469
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:11,342
他今天晚上就会来，我答应在这见他了
He's coming here tonight. I promised to meet him.

470
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:16,556
对不起，孩子，你以后不能再见那个年轻人
I'm sorry, child, but you must never see that young man again.

471
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,642
噢，不，不！
Oh, no! No!

472
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:23,938
我无法相信！不，不！
I can't believe it! No! No!

473
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:31,737
我们以为她会很开心
And we thought she'd be so happy.

474
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:49,963
还没见到她，休伯特
No sign of heryet, Hubert.

475
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:53,967
不会这么早 这会是日落前最美好的半个小时
'Course not. It's a good half hour 'til sunset.

476
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:00,806
啊，漂亮的鸟儿
Ah, excellent bird.

477
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,852
噢，别这样，来吧。
Oh, now, come, man!

478
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:07,563
振作起来，战争结束了
Buck up! Battle's over!

479
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:09,649
像这里那样好的女孩
Girl's as good as here.

480
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:12,902
对不起，休伯特，但是16年来....
I'm sorry, Hubert, but after sixteen years...

481
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:15,362
的忧虑，谁也不会知道--
ofworrying, never knowing--

482
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,198
过去了，一切都过去了
The past! All in the past.

483
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:27,791
今晚，我们为将来干杯...
Tonight, we toast the future...

484
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,461
这是我收藏了16年的东西
with something I've been saving for sixteen years.

485
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:36,967
来，为了未来！
Here. To the future!

486
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,635
对，休伯特，为了未来！
Right, Hubert. To the future.

487
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,975
干！干！
- Skumps, skumps - Skumps

488
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:49,687
- 为了今晚干杯！ - 未来很美好！

489
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:51,605
未来多么光明！
The future is bright

490
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,734
我们的孩子就要结婚 我们的国家就要统一
Our children will marry Our kingdoms unite

491
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,320
干！干！
Skumps, skumps

492
00:40:58,404 --> 00:41:00,989
干！
Skumps

493
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:07,161
啊，极品的珍藏
Ah, excel lent vi ntage.

494
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:15,962
- 现在，为了新的家庭干杯！嗯？ - 新家庭？
- And now, to the new home, eh? - New home?

495
00:41:16,046 --> 00:41:18,506
孩子们需要有他们自己的家，不是吗？
Children need a nest of their own, what?

496
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,968
一个安置他们的窝，嗯？
Place to raise their little brood, eh?

497
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:24,302
啊，我期待那一天
Well, I suppose in time--

498
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:27,013
当然了，为了新家庭！
Of course! To the home!

499
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:28,849
干！干！
- Skumps - Skumps

500
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:32,144
- 为了新家庭干杯 - 我们要建造一座壮丽的宫殿
-A toast to the home - One grander by far

501
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:34,187
比罗马宫殿还要壮丽的
Than a palace in Rome

502
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:38,233
我给你倒满，你杯子里全是泡沫
Uh, let me fill up your glass. That glass was all foam.

503
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,819
干！
Skumps, skumps

504
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:43,238
干！
Skumps

505
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:53,622
这个计划！
The plans!

506
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,630
你觉得怎么样？当然，并不详细
Well, what do you think? Nothing elaborate, of course.

507
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:05,593
40间卧室，餐厅，蜜月别墅
Forty bedrooms, dining hall. Honeymoon cottage, really.

508
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:08,928
你的意思是，已经在建那座宫殿了？
You-- You mean, you're building it already?

509
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:12,724
建好了！完成了！他们明天就能搬进去
Built, man! Finished! Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.

510
00:42:12,808 --> 00:42:17,270
明天？但是，休伯特，他们还没有结婚
Tomorrow? But, Hubert, they're not even married yet.

511
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:20,190
今晚看好点，直到婚礼
Take care of that tonight. To the wedding!

512
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:23,985
等一会儿，休伯特，我还没有见到我的女儿
Now hold on, Hubert. I haven't even seen my daughteryet...

513
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:26,029
你就把她从我身边抢走了
and you're taking her away from me.

514
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:28,448
- 你正在把菲利普带过来，是吗？ - 是的，不过
- Getting my Phillip, aren't you? - Yes, but--

515
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:30,782
我们急着抱孙子，不是吗？
Want to see our grandchildren, don't we?

516
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:33,494
- 当然，但是... - 我们要抓紧时间
- Of course, but, uh-- - There's no time to lose.

517
00:42:33,578 --> 00:42:36,914
我们年事已高
Getting on in years.

518
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:40,417
- 为了婚礼 - 现在，理智一点，休伯特
- To the wedding! - Now, be reasonable, Hubert.

519
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:44,213
毕竟，奥罗拉根本不知道这一切
After all, Aurora knows nothing about all this.

520
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:49,968
- 是吗？ - 嗯，也许会有些震惊
- Well? - Well, it-- it may come as quite a shock.

521
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:53,596
震惊？菲利普，会震惊吗？
Shock? My Phillip, a shock?

522
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,349
菲利普怎么了？
What's wrong with my Phillip?

523
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,893
没什么，休伯特，我只是想说--
Nothing, Hubert. I only meant--

524
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:02,104
你的女儿为什么不喜欢我的儿子？
Why doesn't your daughter like my son?

525
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:05,274
- 现在..... - 我不是很确定。
- Now, now-- - I'm not so sure...

526
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,110
我的儿子喜欢你的女儿！
my son likes your daughter!

527
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:11,656
- 现在，看这里 - 我不确定我的孙子....
- Now, see here. - I'm not so sure my grandchildren...

528
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:14,157
喜欢你成为他的祖父！
want you for a grandfather!

529
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:16,952
为什么？你不可理喻.....
Why, you, you unreasonable...

530
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:20,247
- 啊？谁？啊。 - 虚伪，粗暴，多嘴的老家伙！
- Huh? Who? Uh-- - pompous, blustering, old windbag!

531
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,625
- 不可理喻，虚伪 - 小心，先生！
Unreasonable, pompous-- On guard, sir!

532
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:26,253
我警告你，休伯特，这会引起战争
I warn you, Hubert, this means war.

533
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,506
前进！为了荣誉，为了王国！
Forward! For honour! For country!

534
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,509
噢！噢！
Oh! Ohh!

535
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:40,432
- 嗨 - 可是，这是怎么了？
- Hey. - What's this all about, anyway?

536
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:44,269
没有什么，休伯特！绝对没事！
No-- Nothing, Hubert. Absolutely nothing!

537
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:46,981
呃，孩子们必须去相爱
Eh, children bound to fall in love with each other.

538
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:50,442
正是，没错 而且，为了孙子
Yeah. Precisely. And as for grandchildren...

539
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,405
我会马上让那群皇室的木雕家们明天开工
I'll have the royal woodcarvers start work on the cradle tomorrow.

540
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:57,408
要豪华的！ 极其壮丽，当然
Splendid! King-size, of course.

541
00:43:57,491 --> 00:44:00,618
当然 为了木雕家们
Certainly. To the woodcarvers guild.

542
00:44:14,091 --> 00:44:18,428
尊敬的，菲利普王子！
His Royal Highness, Prince Phillip!

543
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:20,971
菲利普？
Phillip?

544
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:29,688
菲利普! 菲利普!
Phillip! Phillip!

545
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:31,857
菲利普！噢，菲利普！
Phillip! Ho, Phillip!

546
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:40,282
快点，孩子，快！
H-Hurry, boy, hurry!

547
00:44:40,366 --> 00:44:42,409
啊，换身合适的衣服
Uh, change into something suitable.

548
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,869
你不能穿成这样见你未来的新娘
Can't meetyour future bride looking like that.

549
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:48,372
- 我已经见过她了，爸爸 - 是吗？你见过她？哪里？
- But I have met her, Father. - Yeah-- You have? Where?

550
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:50,750
在一次梦里
Once upon a dream.

551
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:54,462
噢，别这样，菲利普！ 别这样，哇，菲利普！
Oh, Phillip! Stop it! Stop that! Wa-- Phillip!

552
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:56,464
菲利普，放下我！
Phi-- Put me down!

553
00:44:56,548 --> 00:44:59,717
那好，这个梦说了些什么？
Now, what's all this "dream" nonsense?

554
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:02,553
这不是梦，爸爸 我真的见过她了
It wasn't a dream, Father. I really did meet her.

555
00:45:02,637 --> 00:45:06,098
噢，奥罗拉公主？天啊，我们一定要告诉斯蒂芬
Oh, the Princess Aurora? Good heavens, we must tell Stefan.

556
00:45:06,182 --> 00:45:09,142
- 为什么？这真的很不可思议 - 可是，我没有说这是奥罗拉
-Why, this is the most amazing-- -I-I didn't say it was Aurora.

557
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:11,144
你一定有的，你说了
You most certainly did. You-- You said--

558
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:14,606
我只是说我见到了我要娶的女孩，但我不知道她是谁
I said I met the girl I was going to marry. I don't know who she was.

559
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,234
- 一个乡下女孩，我猜 - 一个乡下女孩？
- A peasant girl, I suppose. - A-- A peasant g-girl?

560
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,487
你要娶一个...
You-- You're going to marry a g--

561
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:23,615
怎么了？菲利普，你开玩笑吧
Why, Phillip, you're joking.

562
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:30,537
不是吗？
Isn't he?

563
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:33,916
噢，你不可以这样做。
Oh! Y-Y-You can't do this to me.

564
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,962
为了她放弃王座，国家？
Give up the throne, the kingdom, for some-- some nobody?

565
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:41,465
我不会让你这么做的
By Harry, I won't have it!

566
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:45,052
你是王子，你得娶公主！
You're a prince, and you're going to marry a princess!

567
00:45:45,136 --> 00:45:47,221
爸爸，你的思想还活在过去。
Now, Father, you're living in the past.

568
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:49,348
这是14世纪了，现在--
This is the fourteenth century. Nowadays--

569
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:53,851
现在，我还是国王，我命令你理智一点！
Nowadays I'm still the king! And I command you to come to your senses!

570
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:55,853
- 我要娶我爱的女孩。 - 没错！
- And marry the girl I love. - Exactly!

571
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:59,690
- 再见，爸爸 - 娶你爱的女孩...不行！不行！
- Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye, Father. Marry the girl you-- No, no!

572
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:02,360
菲利普，站住，回来！
No, no, Phillip! Stop! Come back!

573
00:46:02,444 --> 00:46:04,695
噢，菲利普！
Oh, Phillip!

574
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:12,036
菲利普！
Phillip!

575
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,351
我该怎么跟斯蒂芬交待呢？
How-- How will I ever tell Stefan?

576
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:24,563
我们现在进去
Come along now.

577
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:38,660
好的，就在这里，亲爱的
All right. In here, dear.

578
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:45,166
- 哦！ - 锁上门，玛莉怀德
- Oh! - Bolt the door, Merryweather.

579
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,169
弗娜，拉上窗帘
Fauna, pull the drapes.

580
00:47:48,253 --> 00:47:53,048
好了，亲爱的，你坐在这里
And now, dear, ifyou'll just sit here.

581
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:57,678
这是给你最后的礼物，孩子....
This one last gift, dear child, for thee...

582
00:47:57,763 --> 00:48:00,806
皇室的象征：
the symbol of thy royalty:

583
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:04,560
一顶优雅和美丽的王冠
a crown to wear in grace and beauty...

584
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:07,729
代表了你的权力和皇室的责任
as is thy right and royal duty.

585
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:15,445
- 现在，亲爱的 - 来吧
- Now, dear-- - Come.

586
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:21,409
让她单独呆一会儿
Let her have a few moments alone.

587
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:23,745
这就是她见到的男孩
It's that boy she met.

588
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:25,538
我们该怎么做？
What ever are we going to do?

589
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,415
噢！我不明白为什么她一定要嫁给那些老王子
Ohh! I don't see why she has to marry any old prince.

590
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:14,751
亲爱的，这不是我们能决定的
Now, that's not for us to decide, dear.

591
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,891
也许，我们应该把这些告诉斯蒂芬国王
Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy.

592
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:32,852
- 我们为什么不这样做呢？ - 听！
- Well, why don't we? - Listen!

593
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:35,187
不好，是巫婆！罗丝
Maleficent! Rose!

594
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,231
- 罗丝! - 罗丝!
- Rose! - Rose!

595
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:40,401
- 噢，我们怎么能留下她一个人？ - 不！ 罗丝！
-Oh, why did we leave her alone? -No! No! -Rose!

596
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:42,403
罗丝！
Rose!

597
00:50:02,006 --> 00:50:05,174
- 这里 - 罗丝！罗丝！
- Here. - Rose! - Rose!

598
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:07,427
- 罗丝! 罗丝, 你在哪? - 罗丝！
- Rose! Rose, where are you? - Rose! - Rose!

599
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:10,096
你在哪?
Where are you?

600
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,730
罗丝！罗丝！罗丝！
Rose! Rose! Rose!

601
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:33,785
- 罗丝！罗丝！ - 罗丝！
- Rose! Rose! - Rose!

602
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:46,047
- 罗丝！
- Rose! - Rose! - Rose!

603
00:50:57,184 --> 00:51:00,853
- 罗丝！ - 别碰任何东西!
- Rose! - Rose! - Don't touch anything!

604
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,979
任何东西!任何东西!
Anything! Anything!

605
00:51:03,064 --> 00:51:06,983
碰那个锭子 我说，碰它！
Touch the spindle. Touch it, I say.

606
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,742
可怜的人，白痴们...
You poor, simple fools...

607
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,660
还想着你们能够击败我呢
thinking you could defeat me.

608
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:21,164
我，万恶的主人
Me, the mistress of all evil!

609
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:26,461
这就是你们高贵的公主
Well, here's your precious princess.

610
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:36,178
- 罗丝! - 噢，罗丝!
- Rose! - Oh, Rose!

611
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:41,266
噢，我不会原谅自己的
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.

612
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,186
这是我们的过失
We're all to blame.

613
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,697
斯蒂芬，有，有一件重要的事我必须要告诉你
Stefan, th-there's-- there's something important I have to tell you.

614
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:58,741
等会再说，休伯特
Uh, not now, Hubert.

615
00:51:58,826 --> 00:52:00,910
但，但这是关于菲利普的
But-- But it's a-about Phillip.

616
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:04,163
菲利普？噢，是的，菲利普
Phillip? Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.

617
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:08,209
- 那个孩子呢? - 那就是我将要跟你说的
- Why, where is the boy? - That's what I'm trying to tell you.

618
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,293
- 立即召他来 - 但是--
-Well, send for him immediately. -But--

619
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,462
嘘！
Shh!

620
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,508
太阳下山了
The sun has set.

621
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,928
准备好迎接你的公主
Make ready to welcome your princess.

622
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,489
可怜的斯蒂芬国王和王后
Poor King Stefan and the queen.

623
00:53:24,574 --> 00:53:27,451
他们发现了会很伤心
They'll be heartbroken when they find out.

624
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:33,123
- 不会的 - 不会？
- They're not going to. - They aren't?

625
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:37,336
- 但是... - 我会让他们都沉睡，直到罗斯醒来
- But-- - We'll put them all to sleep until Rose awakens.

626
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:47,136
来吧
Come.

627
00:53:54,728 --> 00:54:01,025
睡美人！
Sleeping Beauty fair

628
00:54:02,193 --> 00:54:06,196
夕阳的金色光芒

629
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,283
在你的头发里
In your hair

630
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:14,412
性感的嘴唇
Lips that shame

631
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:18,291
红色，红色的玫瑰
The red, red rose

632
00:54:20,044 --> 00:54:23,171
做着真爱的梦
Dreaming oftrue love

633
00:54:23,254 --> 00:54:29,176
在沉睡
In slumber repose

634
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,388
有一天
One day

635
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:37,476
他会来到
He will come

636
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:46,235
在黎明到来的时候
Riding out ofthe dawn

637
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,320
你就会醒来
Andyou'll awaken

638
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:54,325
得到第一次爱的吻
To love's first kiss

639
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:56,786
到那时候，
'Til then

640
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,372
睡美人

641
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:03,584
就会醒来
Sleep on

642
00:55:04,503 --> 00:55:08,714
有一天你会醒来
One dayyou'll awaken

00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,425
得到第一次爱的吻
To love's first kiss

644
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:17,013
到那个时候
'Til then

645
00:55:17,098 --> 00:55:21,810
睡美人
Sleeping Beauty

646
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:27,524
就会醒来
Sleep on

647
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:38,826
我刚刚跟菲利普王子谈过
Wel l, just been talking to Phillip.

648
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:43,622
好像他爱上了一个乡下的女孩
Seems he's fallen in love with some-- peasant girl.

649
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,250
乡下女孩？
Peasant girl?

650
00:55:46,334 --> 00:55:49,587
是的
Yes? Yes?

651
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:52,590
乡下女孩？是谁？他在哪里碰到的？
The peasant girl? Who is she? Where did he meet her?

652
00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:56,467
啊，就是他碰到的乡下女孩--
Uh, just some peasant girl he met--

653
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:58,469
哪里？哪里？
Where? Where?

654
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:02,557
在一次梦里
Once upon a dream.

655
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:06,644
梦里.... 罗丝！菲利普王子！
Once upon a dre-- Rose! Prince Phillip!

656
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:09,397
噢！
Oh! Oh!

657
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:15,528
快点，我们必须回到村舍里
Come on. We've got to get back to the cottage.

658
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:05,241
进来吧。
Come in.

659
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:36,939
哇！
Well!

660
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,442
这礼物真令人惊喜。
This is a pleasant surprise.

661
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:44,238
我设下了陷阱来抓农民，
I set my trap for a peasant, and lo...

662
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:46,447
却抓到了王子
I catch a prince.

663
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:51,702
带他走
Away with him.

664
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:54,956
但是温柔一点，宝贝，轻点
But gently, my pets. Gently.

665
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,336
我有新计划了
I have plans for our royal guest.

666
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:35,035
巫婆！
- Maleficent! - Maleficent! - Maleficent!

667
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,830
她抓走了菲利普王子！
She's got Prince Phillip!

668
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:40,833
在禁山上
At the Forbidden Mountain.

669
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,419
但是，我们不能去那
But we can't-- we can't go there.

670
00:58:44,504 --> 00:58:47,423
可以的，而且必须去
We can, and we must!

671
01:01:08,641 --> 01:01:11,726
可惜菲利普王子不在这....
What a pity Prince Phillip can't be here...

672
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:14,604
参加不了庆典
to enjoy the celebration.

673
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:20,569
来吧，我们去地牢里跟他干杯
Come. We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up.

674
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,539
噢，来吧，菲利普王子
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

675
01:02:17,624 --> 01:02:20,375
怎么那么忧郁？
Why so melancholy?

676
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,754
一个美好的未来就在你的面前
A wondrous future lies before you.

677
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:26,715
你，就是那个英雄...
You, the destined hero...

678
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,052
一个迷人的童话故事里的英雄
of a charming fairy tale come true.

679
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,601
看，斯蒂芬国王的城堡。
Behold, King Stefan's castle.

680
01:02:38,685 --> 01:02:41,312
在那边的塔顶上....
And in yonder topmost tower...

681
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:44,065
正在梦见她的真爱....
dreaming of her true love...

682
01:02:44,149 --> 01:02:47,068
奥罗拉公主
the Princess Aurora.

683
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:51,572
但是看见了奇怪的命运
But see the gracious whim of fate.

684
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:54,992
为什么，是一模一样的乡下女孩...
Why, 'tis the selfsame peasant maid...

685
01:02:55,077 --> 01:02:58,996
就是她昨天得到了我们王子的心
who won the heart of our noble prince but yesterday.

686
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:06,211
她真的是一位很美丽的女孩...
She is indeed most wondrous fair...

687
01:03:07,463 --> 01:03:10,256
头发里有夕阳的金色光芒....
gold of sunshine in her hair...

688
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:14,761
有红玫瑰的嘴唇
Iips that shame the red, red rose.

689
01:03:14,845 --> 01:03:19,099
沉睡了很久，她终于发现了依靠
In ageless sleep, she finds repose.

690
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:23,977
时光匆匆的过去
The years roll by.

691
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:29,108
但是，几百年对一颗坚定的心来说就像只有一天
But a hundred years to a steadfast heart are but a day.

692
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:32,986
现在，地牢的大门....
And now, the gates of a dungeon part...

693
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:37,699
已经开了，我们的王子也可以出发了
and our prince is free to go his way.

694
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:41,787
骑上他的马
Off he rides on his noble steed--

695
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:46,207
一个勇敢的高大的身躯，
a valiant figure, straight and tall--

696
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:48,501
将要唤醒他的爱....
to wake his love...

697
01:03:48,585 --> 01:03:52,004
献出第一次爱的吻....
with love's first kiss...

698
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:57,301
他将证明真爱会战胜一切！
and prove that true love conquers all!

699
01:04:00,722 --> 01:04:03,474
为什么，你，你--
Why, you, you, y--

700
01:04:06,894 --> 01:04:10,647
来吧，宝贝，我们离开高贵的公主...
Come, my pet. Let us leave our noble prince...

701
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:14,151
随着这些愉快的想法
with these happy thoughts.

702
01:04:17,738 --> 01:04:20,949
这是最快乐的一天
A most gratifying day.

703
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:28,874
16年来第一次...
For the first time in sixteen years...

704
01:04:28,957 --> 01:04:32,126
我会睡的很香
I shall sleep well.

705
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:50,352
没有时间解释了
Shh! No time to explain.

706
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:02,030
等等，菲利普王子，真爱之路...
Wait, Prince Phillip. The road to true love...

707
01:05:02,114 --> 01:05:05,158
可能仍然被很多的危险阻碍...
may be barred by still many more dangers...

708
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:07,452
你必须自己单独去面对
which you alone will have to face.

709
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:12,373
因此你要装备这块坚固的魔法盾牌...
So arm thyselfwith this enchanted shield ofvirtue...

710
01:05:12,457 --> 01:05:15,709
和这把锋利的真理之剑...
and this mighty sword of truth...

711
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:20,047
用这些正义的武器将战胜邪恶
for these weapons of righteousness will triumph over evil.

712
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:22,799
现在，我们得抓紧时间
Now, come. We must hurry.

713
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:12,055
菲利普，当心！
Phillip, watch out!

714
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:12,737
安静！你，告诉那些愚蠢的人--
Silence! You, tell those fools to--

715
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:16,241
不！不！
No! No!

716
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:22,914
小心，菲利普！
Watch out, Phillip!

717
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:32,923
快点！快点，菲利普！
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

718
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:48,355
荆棘满布的森林将是他的坟墓...
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb...

719
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,900
布满毁灭的雾穿过天空忍受!
borne through the skies on a fog of doom!

720
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,486
现在，伴随着诅咒，一切都在我掌握之中
Now go with a curse and serve me well.

721
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:59,365
斯蒂芬的城堡周围布满我的符咒
'Round Stefan's castle cast my spell.

722
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:52,959
不！这不可能！
No! It cannot be!

723
01:08:58,756 --> 01:09:02,717
现在你要面对的是我，王子...
Now shall you deal with me, O Prince...

724
01:09:02,802 --> 01:09:05,512
地狱的全部力量!
and all the powers of hell!

725
01:09:50,806 --> 01:09:53,391
上来，沿着这上来!
Up! Up this way!

726
01:10:09,157 --> 01:10:11,908
现在，真理之剑，飞跃雨燕...
Now, sword of truth, fly swift and sure...

727
01:10:11,993 --> 01:10:15,495
确信邪恶灭亡，真理永存！
that evil die and good endure!

728
01:11:57,843 --> 01:11:59,928
啊--噢，噢
Ehhh-- Oh, oh, uh--

729
01:12:00,012 --> 01:12:04,099
原谅我，休伯特。葡萄酒，现在，嗯--
Forgive me, Hubert. Ehh, uh, the wine. Now, uh--

730
01:12:04,183 --> 01:12:06,142
g你，在说话吗?
You, uh, were saying?

731
01:12:06,227 --> 01:12:10,146
啊? 我在说吗？ 噢，噢，是的
Huh? I-I was? Oh! Oh, yes.

732
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:14,985
毕竟，斯蒂芬，这是十四世纪
Well, after all, Stefan, this is the fourteenth century.

733
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:18,321
是的，你，你刚才已经说过了
Yes. You, uh, you said that a moment ago.

734
01:12:18,405 --> 01:12:21,448
回到刚才的主题...
Well, to come right to the point...

735
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:24,326
我儿子菲利普说他要结婚，和--
