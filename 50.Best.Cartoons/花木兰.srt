哦
Oops.

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,380
她火气这么大干嘛?
Who spit in her bean curd?

太瘦了
Mmm. Too skinny.

190
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,230
不容易生出儿子
Hmph! Not good for bearing sons.

191
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,470
妇有四德指的是什么?

192
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,100
说呀

193
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,880
妇德指导的是谦虚

194
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,480
而妇言是少说话

195
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,080
妇容是和悦，还有妇力……

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,340
是妇功

197
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,320
妇功意思是服从

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,860
跟我来
Hmm. This way.

199
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,070

取悦你未未的公婆
To please your future in-laws,

202
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,770
一定要谨慎望而却步、优雅

a sense of dignity...

203
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,450
还要心存恭敬

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,310
你也必须注意仪态
You must also be poised.

205
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,690
对不起
Um, pardon me.

206
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
还要安静
And silent!

207
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,500
能不能还我一下?
Could l just take that back?

208
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,460

One moment.

209

为什么，你笨手笨脚
Why, you clumsy...

210
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,810
我认为进行得顺利，对吧?
l think it's going well, don't you?

211
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,460
快给我水，浇水呀
Put it out! Put it out! Put it out!

212
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,860
你实在是太不像话
You are a disgrace!

213
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
你也许看起来像个新娘
You may look like a bride,

214
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,470
可是永远不会为你们家争光
but you will never bring your family honor!

215

00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:53,769
@ Someone I don't know

229
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,902

@ Who I am inside

234
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:23,229
@ When will my reflection show

235
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,567
@ Who I am

236
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:30,438

什么事?

你该教教你女儿

男人说话，哪有她插嘴的份?

有足够的年轻人为国打仗啊

295
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,330
你得快追她回来
You must go after her.

这要杀头的
She could be killed.

297
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,260
只有我们不说

298
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,930
她才能活命

299
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,780
列祖列宗，求求你们

300
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,610
保佑木兰
Watch over Mulan.

301
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,510
木须，醒来吧
Mushu, awaken!

302
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,910
我复活了!
I live!

303
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,620
告诉我哪个凡人要我保护?

304
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,180
老祖宗要我去，只要开口

305
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,020
木须

306
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,720
我来说几句，要是谁敢找我们花家的麻烦
Let me say somethin'. Anybody who's

308
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,090
木须

309
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,970
它们才是守护神

310
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,370
它们…
They...

311
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,000
保护这个家

312
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,340
而你这降了级的
And you, o demoted one?

313
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,440
我…是负责敲锣
l... ring the gong.

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,840
说对了，现在去叫醒祖先们吧
That's right.Now, wake up the ancestors.

315
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,910
我这就去叫醒大家

316
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,280
大家起来

317
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,120
快起来，别偷懒了

318
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,350
要办正事罗，别睡美容觉了

319
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,560
我就知道……
l knew it. l knew it!

320
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,930
木兰从一开始就是个大麻烦
That Mulan was a troublemaker from the start!

321
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,830
别看我
Don't look at me.

322
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,670
她可是你家那边的人
She gets it from your side of the family.

323

她只想帮助她父亲
She's trying to help her father.

324
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,170
要是她被人发现
lf she's discovered,

325
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,730
花家就会永远抬不起头
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

326
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,110
花家祠堂会声望全无

327
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,250
千百年传统沦丧

328
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,110
家产全得没收

329
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,910
我家孩子从没惹过麻烦
My children never caused such trouble.

330
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,080
他们全是针灸师傅
They all became acupuncturists.

331
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,520
总不能全都当针灸师啊
Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.

332
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,360
是啊，你的曾孙女还女扮男装哩
No! Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

333
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,690
派守护神带她回来
Let a guardian bring her back.

334
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,830
是啊，叫醒最精明的
Yes, awaken the most cunning.

335
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,700
不，那行动最快的
No, the swiftest.

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,200
不，最有智慧的
No, send the wisest.

337
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,460
安静
Silence!

338
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,830
我们得派能力最强的
We must send the most powerful of all.

339
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,200
好啦…我了解，我去
Okay, okay, l get the drift.l'll go.

340
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,910
你们以为我不行?
Y'all don't think l can do it.

341
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,310
看我的
Watch this here.

342
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,920
我不错吧?
Aha! Jump back.l'm pretty hot, huh?

343
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,010
谁敢让我试试看啊?

344
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,790
你有机会去保护花家
You had your chance to protect the Fa family.

345
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,430
结果却把花嶝害得很惨

346
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,260
对呀，多亏你了
Yeah, thanks a lot.

347
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,550
什么意思?
And your point is?

348
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,960
意思是……
The point is ...

349
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,200
我们要派真正的龙去找木兰
we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

350
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,400
什么?
What? What?

351
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,560
我是真正的龙啊
l'm a real dragon!

352
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,970
你根本就不够格
You are not worthy of this spot.

353
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,140
现在快叫醒石像神龙吧
Now, awaken the great stone dragon.

354
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,410
那你会重新考虑让我去吗?
So you'll get back to me on the job thing?

355
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,990
唉!

356
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,010
唉!

357
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,580
我只是要个机会嘛

358
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,960
又不是要你老命
lt's not like it'll kill ya.

359
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,650
石头，醒醒啊
Yo, Rocky, wake up!

360
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,220
你得去追木兰
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

361
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,960
快起来，去追她

362
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,930
去呀

363
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,330

364
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,840

365
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,150
有人在吗?

366
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,370
醒醒!

367
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,230
石头…

368
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,090
他们会杀我
Oh, man, they're gonna kill me.

369
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,600
石像神龙

370
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,000
你醒了吗?

371
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,610

别担心，我不会丢脸的
Don't even worry about it.

我好像扭到我的筋骨了

这下可好，现在该怎么办?
That's just great.
Now what?

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,010
我死定了，都是因为男人婆

干嘛要女扮男装惹祸?

去找她?

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,280
你有毛病吗?
What's the matter with you?

385
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,880
石像神龙已裂成两半

386
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,010
除非她是英雄

387
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,750
我才能回来

388
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,390
等等，这就对了

389
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,660
我让她变成英雄就能凯旋归来

390
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,090
就这么办

391
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,650
我真聪明

392
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,030

You're lucky?

看我拔掉你的胡须如何？

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,540
京城来的探子

他不断修筑长城向我挑战

我只是陪他玩玩

01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,730
我可以解释
l can explain.

924
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,840
原来是真的
So it's true!

925
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,430
李翔

926
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,610
我早就觉得你怪怪的
l knew there was something wrong with you.

927
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,110
一个娘儿们
A woman!

928
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,410
最毒妇人心
Treacherous snake!

929
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,750
我叫花木兰
My name is Mulan.

930
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,310
我是为了救父亲
l did it to save my father

931
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,520
滔天大罪
High treason!

932
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,490
我并不想骗人
l didn't mean for it to go this far.

933
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,530
完全的不诚实
Ultimate dishonor!

934
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,390
这是唯一的办法
lt was the only way.

935
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,420
请相信我
Please, believe me.

936
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,730
校尉
Captain?

937
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,830
抓住他
Restrain him!

938
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,070
国有国法
You know the law

939
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,050
一命还一命
A life for a life.

940
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,030
现在扯平了
My debt is repaid.

941
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,520
出发
Move out!

942
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,670
你不能就这样啊
But you can't just...

943
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:27,930
我说了
l said

944
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,800
出发
move out.

945
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,400
差一点
It was this close.

946
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,670
就差这么一丁点  让老祖宗对我刮目相看
This close to impressin' the ancestors,

947
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,210
就能扬眉吐气
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.

948
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,620
这下全完了
Man. All my fine work. Pfft.

949
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:25,960
我不该离家的
l should never have left home.

950
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,960
你是为了救老父一命
Hey, come on.You went to save your father's life.

951
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:33,000
没想到却让他丢尽颜面
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors

952
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,730
连朋友也没了
and losin' all your friends?

953
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,440
你得……
You know, you just gotta...

954
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,770
学着把事情看开点
learn to let these things go.

955
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,810
也许我不是为了我爹
Maybe l didn't go for my father.

956
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:48,980
也许我只想证明自己是对的
Maybe what l really wanted was to prove l could do things right.

957
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,450
希望当我看着镜子
So when l looked in the mirror,

958
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:54,080
就会觉得对得起自己
l'd see someone worthwhile.

959
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,620
可是我错了
But l was wrong.

960
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,890
我什么都看不到
l see nothing.

961
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,670
这头盔脏了，该洗洗了
That's just 'cause this needs a little spit, that's all.

962
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:17,440
我帮你擦亮它
Let me shine this up for ya.

963
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,550
你看，你好漂亮
l can see you. Look at you.You look so pretty.

964
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,760
其实我们都是冒牌货
The truth is, we're both frauds.

965
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:31,290
你老祖宗没派我来，他们也不喜欢我
Your ancestors never sent me.They don't even like me.

966
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,290
你牺牲自己去救你爱的人
l mean, you risked your life to help people you love.

967
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,490
我却利用你帮我自己
l risked your life to help myself.

968
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,070
起码你的心肠比我好
At least you had good intentions.

969
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,030
什么!你也不是幸运符?
What? What do you mean you're not lucky?

970
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,540
你骗了我?
You lied to me?

971
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,650
那你是什么，羊吗?
And what are you, a sheep?

972
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:56,150
我早晚都得面对我父亲
l'll have to face my father sooner or later.

973
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,380
回家吧
Let's go home

974
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,420
是啊，这样子一定不会好看的
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.

975
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,350
不过你别担心
But don't you worry, okay?

976
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,360
船到桥头自然直
Things will work out.

977
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,520
我们要有始
We started this thing together,

978
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,590
有终
and that's how we'll finish it.

979
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,100
我保证
l promise.

980
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,220
回家的路在那边
Uh, home is that way.

981
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,290
我还有事要做
l have to do something.

982
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,660
看见那些匈奴没?
Did you see those Huns?

983
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,290
从雪堆爬出来
They popped out of the snow!

984
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,720
居然没事
Like daisies!

985
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,760
我们是不是同心协力?
Are we in this together or not?

986
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:55,500
让我们去教训那些匈奴吧
Well, let's go kick some Hunny buns!

987
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:57,640
Yee-haw!
好

988
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:21,090
让路，我们的英雄回来了
Make way for the heroes of China.

989
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:36,870
李翔

990
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,740
木兰

991
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,110
匈奴没死，他们混进京城
The Huns are alive!They're in the city!

992
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,980
你不该来这的，回家去吧
You don't belong here, Mulan.Go home.

993
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:48,120
我在山上看到他们
l saw them in the mountains.

994
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,750
你一定要相信我
You have to believe me.

为什么?
Why should l?

996
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,460
我不是回来了吗?
Why else would l come back?

997
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,660
你说你相信花平
You said you'd trust Ping.

998
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,230
为什么不能相信木兰?
Why is Mulan any different?

999
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:11,710
大家小心
Keep your eyes open.

1000
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,520
我知道他们在这儿
l know they're here

1001

找一个肯相信我的人
To find someone who will believe me.

1003
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,490
我的子民们
My children,

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,420
感谢老天爷保佑、照顾京城

01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,830
今晚大家高枕无忧

01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,320
没人肯听
No one will listen.

1011
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,180
抱歉，你说什么?
Huh? l'm sorry.Did you say something?

1012
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,280
木须

1013
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,350
因为你现在是女儿身啊
You're a girl again, remember?

1014
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:32,690
启票皇上
Your Majesty,

01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:36,400
这是匈奴首领，单于的剑
l present to you the sword of Shan-Yu.

我知道它对你的意义

这样来不及救皇上
They'll never reach the emperor in time.

1021
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,390
用力…

我这样穿会不会看起来很胖?
Does this dress make me look fat?

是谁?
Who's there?

01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,850
你不知道吗?
You don't have a plan?

1054
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,960
我边打边想…不行吗?
Hey, l'm making this up as l... go.

1055

1070
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:28,470
她人呢?
Where is she?

1071
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:31,140
她闯了大祸
Now she's done it.

What a mess!Stand aside!

1073

That is enough.

1079

皇上，请听我解释

朕听说过你的事，花木兰

不告而别
