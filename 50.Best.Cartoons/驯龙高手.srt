4
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,810
这里是伯克村
This is Berk.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,100
绝望谷向北航行十二天
It's 12 days north of Hopeless and a few

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,030
到达极寒地以南
degrees south of Freezing to Death.

7
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,220
它就座落在痛苦之经线上
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.

8
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,390
我的村庄  一言以蔽之  坚固
My village. In a word: sturdy.

9
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,180
它有七代人的历史
It's been here for seven generations

10
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,250
但每所建筑仍崭新如初
but every single building is new.

11
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,090
我们打渔  狩猎  享受迷人的日落
We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets.

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,790
唯一的麻烦就是害虫
The only problems are the pests.

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,830
许多地方有老鼠或蚊子
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,930
而我们有...
We have...

15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,230
龙
... dragons.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,820
换做其他人就逃了  可我们不走
Most people would leave, but not us.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,070
我们是维京海盗
We're Vikings.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,440
我们以顽固著称
We have stubbornness issues.

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,890
我名叫卡嗝
My name is Hiccup.

20
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,420
不是个好名字  但好歹不算最差
Great name, I know. But it's not the worst.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,160
父母相信骇人听闻的名字
Parents believe a hideous name will

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,590
能吓走山怪山精
frighten off Gnomes and Trolls.

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,670
好像我们"迷人"的维京风度还不够吓人
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,680
早上好
Morning.

25
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,620
-你在这干嘛  -回去
- What are you doing here? - Get inside!

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,430
回屋里去
Get back inside!

27
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,560
卡嗝  他怎么又出来了
Hiccup! What is he doing out again...

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,710
你出来干什么  回去
What are you doing out? Get inside!

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,410
他是伟岸的史推克  部落首领
That's Stoick the Vast, Chief of the tribe.

30
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,900
听说他在婴儿时期
They say that when he was a baby he popped

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,930
曾把一条龙的脑袋齐肩削去
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,750
我相信吗  能不信吗
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,720
都有些什么龙
What have we got?

34
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,950
巨齿龙  奈德龙  双头龙
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks... Oh,

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,830
还有一群凶煞梦魇
and hordes of Monstruous Nightmares.

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,290
有夜煞吗
Any Night Furys?

37
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,730
-目前没有  -很好
- None so far. - Good.

38
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,570
点燃火柱
Light the torches!

39
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,040
欢迎加入猎龙盛会
Oh, nice of you to join the party.

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,600
我还以为你已经被吃掉了
I thought you'd been carried off.

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,120
谁  我吗  算了吧
Who? Me? Nah, come on...

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,500
我太强壮了  不合它们胃口
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

43
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,360
他们不知道拿我怎么办
They wouldn't know what to do with all... this.

44
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,100
它们需要牙签吧  不是吗
Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,540
这个语气不善
The meathead with the attitude and

46
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,200
装着假肢的蠢蛋名叫嘉伯
interchangeable hands, is Gobber.

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,670
我从小就在他手下当学徒
I have been his apprentice ever since I was little.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,750
好吧  我现在也不大
Well, littler

49
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,040
我们转移到沼泽防御区
We move to the moor defenses.

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,180
在那用弹弩反击
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

51
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,980
看吧  这就是村庄老房子新的原因
See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses.

52
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,060
射击
Fire!

53
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,430
那是小鱼脚
Oh, and that's Fishlegs

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,350
鼻涕唠
Snotlout

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,170
双胞胎悍夫奈和暴芙奈
The twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

56
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,530
还有
And...

57
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,110
雅丝翠
Astrid.

58
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,450
他们的工作酷多了
Aww, their job is so much cooler.

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,490
让我出去  我要立功扬名
Oh, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark!

60
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,520
你的名声已经够响亮了  简直臭名昭著
Oh, you have made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,510
求你  只要两分钟  我要杀条龙
Please, 2 minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,030
我的生活就会一片大好
My life will get infinitely better.

63
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,110
说不定还能找个女朋友
I might even get a date.

64
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,660
你举不起锤子  挥不动斧头
You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe.

65
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,390
甚至扔不了这个
You can't even throw one of these.

66
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,160
我承认  但我可以用这个
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,320
看  我就说吧
See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,300
这只是小小的校准问题
But it... it's a mild calibration issue.

69
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,120
卡嗝  如果你想出去和龙战斗
Hiccup, if you ever want to get out there to fight dragons,

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
你就必须改变...
you need to stop all....

71
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,010
这个
... this.

72
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,130
可你指着我全身上下
But you just pointed to all of me.

73
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,580
正是如此
Yes, that's it.

74
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,390
你从头到尾都要改
Stop being all of you.

75
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,790
明白了吧
Oh, yes.

76
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,440
先生  你在玩火
You sir, are playing a dangerous game...

77
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,590
让我这块维京璞玉蒙尘
... keeping this much raw Vikingness contained.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,350
-后果很严重  -我等着瞧
- There will be consequences! - I take my chances.

79
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,560
去磨剑  马上
Sword, sharpened, now!

80
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,010
总有一天我要出去
One day I'll get out there.

81
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,910
因为在这里杀死一条龙意味着全部
Because killing a dragon is everything around here.

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,440
一条奈德龙能让我小有名气
A Nadderhead is sure to get me at least noticed.

83
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,020
巨齿龙比较难对付
Gronckles are tough.

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,600
除掉其中一只肯定能让我交到女朋友
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.

85
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,390
至于双头龙
A Zippleback...

86
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,660
它属珍稀物种  双头意味着双倍地位
Exotic, two heads, twice the status.

87
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,210
他们发现我们的船了
They found the ship!

88
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,510
集中火力攻打低岸
Concentrate fire over the lower bank!

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,390
快点
Hurry up!

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,080
射击
Fire!

91
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,950
还有凶煞梦魇
And then, there's the Monstruous Nightmare.

92
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,920
只有维京精英才敢捕杀它们
Only the best Vikings go after those.

93
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,540
它们喜欢让自己着火
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.

94
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,910
装弹
Reload!

95
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,020
我来对付它
I'll take care of this.

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,420
但终极战利品是谁都没见过的龙
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.

97
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,610
我们称之为...
We call it the...

98
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,460
-夜煞  -趴下
- Night Fury! - Get down!

99
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,630
跳
Jump!

100
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,140
这种龙不偷粮食  从不露面
This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and...

101
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,040
从不失手
... never misses.

102
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,040
没人杀过夜煞
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.

103
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,040
所以我才要成为第一个
That's why I'm going to be the first.

104
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,450
注意堡垒  卡嗝  我要出去
Mind the fort, Hiccup. They need me out there.

105
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,760
待在这  别乱动
Stay!... Put!

106
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,230
就待那儿
There.

107
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,430
你明白我的意思
You know what I mean.

108
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,180
-卡嗝  你在做什么  -回来
- Hiccup, what are you doing? - Come back here!

109
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,480
我知道  马上回来
Yeah, I know, be right back!

110
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,710
小心点
Mind yourself!

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,270
这些怪物还有点力气
The devils still have some juice in them.

112
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,620
快点
Come on.

113
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,190
给我一个射击的目标
Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,670
我打中了吗  我打中了
Oh! I hit it? Yes, I hit it!

115
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,900
有人看到了吗
Did anybody see that?

116
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,530
没说你
Except for you.

117
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,350
-别让它们跑了  -好
- Do not let them escape! - Right!

118
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,000
你喷不出火了
You're all out.

119
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,650
还有一件事没告诉你们
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,940
对不起  爸爸
Sorry, Dad.

121
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,580
可我打中了一条夜煞
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

122
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,200
这次和以前不同  爸爸
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

123
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
我真的打中了...
I mean, I really actually hit...

124
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,910
当时你们在忙  我一击即中
You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot.

125
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,410
它掉到黑暗角去了
It went down just off Raven Point.

126
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,240
我们要派搜寻队去...
Let's get a search party out there before...

127
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,620
闭嘴
Stop!

128
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,600
别说了
Just, stop!

129
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,400
每次你一出来就会引起灾难
Every time you step outside disaster falls.

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,580
你还嫌我的麻烦不够多吗
Can you not see that I have bigger problems?

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,120
冬天就要来了  我得养活一村子人
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!

132
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,090
说句知心话  村里的人少吃点也没事
Between you and me, the village could do

133
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,050
难道你不这么觉得吗
with a little less feeding, don't you think?

134
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,420
这不是开玩笑  卡嗝
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

135
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,490
这么简单的命令  你怎么就不听呢
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,370
我控制不了  我一看到龙就想杀了它
I, I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just...

137
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,780
我本性如此  爸爸
... kill it. You know, it's who I am, Dad.

138
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,460
你能做很多事  卡嗝
Oh, you are many things, Hiccup,

139
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,180
但绝对杀不了龙
but a dragon killer is not one of them.

140
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,480
回屋里去  带他回去
Get back to the house. Make sure he gets there.

141
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,030
我来处理他惹的麻烦
I have his mess to clean up.

142
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,420
干得好
Quite the performance.

143
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,150
我没见过比这更糟的了  真了不起
I've never seen any one mess up that badly. That helped!

144
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,130
承蒙夸奖  我继续努力
Thank you. Thank you. I was trying.

145
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,990
-我真的打中了  -当然  卡嗝
- I really did hit one. - Sure, Hiccup.

146
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,070
-他从不听我说  -那是家族遗传
- He never listens. - Well, it runs in the family.

147
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,960
要不就满脸失望和愤怒
And when he does, it's always with this disappointed scowl

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,310
好像有人克扣了他三文治上的肉
like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich.

149
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,570
打扰一下  女侍  恐怕你
Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you

150
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,420
弄错我想要的儿子了
brought me the wrong offspring.

151
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,170
我点的是肌肉发达的大个子男孩
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms.

152
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,080
还要有勇气和荣誉
Extra guts and glory on the side.

153
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,180
这个却是会说话的鱼骨头
This here. This is a talking fish bone!

154
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,660
你完全想错了
Now, you're thinking about this all wrong.

155
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,010
这和你的外表无关
It's not so much what you look like.

156
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,370
他不能忍受的是你的内在
It's what's inside that he can't stand.

157
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,830
谢谢你的总结
Thank you for summing that up.

158
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,930
重点是这不适合你
Look, the point is, stop trying so

159
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,320
不要再勉为其难了
hard to be something you're not.

160
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,370
我只想成为你们当中的一员
I just want to be one of you guys.

161
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,710
我们不消灭它们  就会被它们消灭
Either we finish them or they'll finish us.

162
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,710
这是除掉它们的唯一办法
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

163
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,170
找到并毁掉龙的巢穴  它们就会离开
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.

164
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,000
它们会去寻找另一个家园
They'll find another home.

165
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,840
趁海水结冰前我们再搜寻一次
One more search, before the ice sets in.

166
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,780
那些船只会有去无回
Those ships never come back.

167
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,690
我们是维京海盗  这是职业病
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

168
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,320
谁愿意和我去
Now who's with me?

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,330
好吧  留下来的人负责照顾卡嗝
Alright,... those who stay will look after Hiccup.

170
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,760
这才像样
That's more like it.

171
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,290
我去收拾我的底衣
I'll pack my undies.

172
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,550
不  你留下训练新兵
No, I need you to stay, and train some new recruits.

173
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,960
好极了  我在忙时卡嗝可以看店
Oh, perfect, yeah. And while I'm busy Hiccup can cover the store.

174
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,720
溶铁  磨刀片  还有很多时间独处
Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...

175
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,260
绝对不会出事
What could possibly go wrong?

176
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,000
我要拿他怎么办  嘉伯
Oh, what am I going to do with him, Gobber?

177
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,610
让他和其他人一起训练
Put him in training with the others.

178
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,700
-我是认真的  -我也是
- No, I'm serious. - So am I.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,890
你还没放龙出来  他就死了
He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.

180
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,770
-这可不一定  -我很肯定
- Oh, you don't know that. - I do know that.

181
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,530
-不  你弄错了  -我不会错
- No, you don't - No, actually, I do.

182
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,440
-不  你错了  -你知道他的德性
- No, you don't. - Listen, you know what he's like.

183
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,160
从他会爬起他就与众不同
From the time he could crawl he's been... different.

184
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,630
他从不听我说
He doesn't listen.

185
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,560
注意力持续时间比麻雀还短
He has the attention span of a sparrow.

186
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,770
我带他去打渔  他却跑去猎山精
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for.. for Trolls!

187
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,450
山精的确存在  它们会偷袜子
Trolls exist! They steal your socks.

188
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,240
可只偷左脚的  为什么呢
But only the left ones. What's with that?

189
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,390
-我小时候...  -又来了
- When I was a boy... - Oh, here we go.

190
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,930
我父亲让我拿头撞石头
My father told me to bang my head

191
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,330
我照做了
against a rock,... and I did it.

192
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,020
我觉得这不合理  但我没质疑他
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.

193
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,060
你知道后来怎么样了吗
And you know what happened?

194
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,150
-你患上头痛  -石头裂成两半
- You got a headache. - That rock split in two.

195
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,990
我从此知道了维京海盗的能力  嘉伯
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.

196
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,580
他能摧毁大山  移平森林
He could crush mountains, level forests,...

197
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,060
驾驭海洋
... tame seas!

198
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,630
我从小就知道自己的能力和责任
Even as a boy I knew what I was, what I had to become...

199
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,480
卡嗝却不是这样
Hiccup is not that boy.

200
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,910
你阻止不了他  史推克
You can't stop him, Stoick.

201
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,380
你只能帮他作好准备
You can only prepare him.

202
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,030
我知道这不中听  但事实是
I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is

203
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,060
你不可能永远保护他
you won't always be around to protect him.

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,030
他还会出去  可能现在已经出去了
He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now.

205
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,350
神明都不眷顾我
Oh, the Gods hate me.

206
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,250
有人丢了刀  有人丢杯子
Some people lose their knife or their mug.

207
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,320
我却丢了一条龙
No, not me! I managed to lose an entire dragon.

208
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,750
我成功了吗  我真的成功了
Oh, wow? I.. I did it? Oh, I did it!

209
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,600
这下一切问题都解决了
This fixes everything. Yes!

210
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,180
我打败了这只凶兽
I have brought down this mighty beast!

211
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,260
我要杀了你  龙先生
I'm gonna kill you, dragon.

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,630
我要挖出你的心脏
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut out your

213
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,210
把它拿去给我的父亲
heart and take it to my father.

214
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,290
我是一名维京海盗
I'm a Viking.

215
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,550
我是维京海盗
I'm a Viking!

216
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,590
这是我做的
I did this.

217
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,410
卡嗝
Hiccup.

218
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,380
爸爸
Dad? Uh...

219
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,070
我有话和你说
I have to talk to you, Dad.

220
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,180
我也要和你谈谈  儿子
I need to speak with you too, son.

221
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,280
是时候让你学习和龙战斗了
I think it's time you to learned to fight dragons.

222
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,020
我不想和龙战斗
I don't want to fight dragons.

223
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,610
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

224
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,010
-你先说  -不  你先说
- Uh, you go first. - No, no, you go first.

225
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,550
好吧  如你所愿
All right. You got your wish.

226
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,570
降龙训练  明天早上开始
Dragon training. You start in the morning.

227
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,400
天啊  我应该先说的
Oh man, I should have gone first.

228
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,420
我在想  你知道的
Uh, cause I was thinking. You know, we have a

229
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,050
我们有很多降龙维京人  但是
surplus of dragon fighting Vikings but,...

230
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,940
我们没有足够的维京面包师
Do we have enough bread-making Vikings,

231
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,700
或是维京修屋工
or small home repair Vikings...

232
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,290
-你会需要这个的  -我不想和龙战斗
- You'll need this. - I don't want to fight dragons.

233
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,470
别胡扯了  你很想的
Oh come on, yes you do.

234
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,880
这么说吧  爸爸  我不能杀龙
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

235
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,770
但你一定得杀
But you will kill dragons.

236
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,580
不  我确定肯定以及一定我不会
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

237
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,970
-是时候了  卡嗝  -你听不到我说的吗
- It's time, Hiccup. - Can you not hear me?

238
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,540
这不是开玩笑  儿子
This is serious, son.

239
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,660
当你拿起这把斧子  你就与我们同在
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.

240
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,110
像我们一样行走  像我们一样交流  
You walk like us. You talk like us.

241
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,570
像我们一样思考
You think like us.

242
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,190
不仅仅是斧子
No more of... this.

243
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,120
你替我决定了我的人生
You just gestured to all of me.

244
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,880
-说定了吗  -都是你的一面之词
- Deal? - This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

245
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,960
说定了吗
Deal?

246
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,350
说定了
Deal.

247
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,780
很好
Good.

248
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,250
努力训练
Train hard.

249
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,600
我会回来的  也许吧
I'll be back. Probably.

250
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,460
我会在这的  可能吧
And I'll be here, maybe.

251
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,390
欢迎来到驯龙场
Welcome to dragon training.

252
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,700
无路可退了
No turning back.

253
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,200
真希望狠狠烧它们
I hope I get some serious burns.

254
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,740
我希望我肩膀或者腰上有把大槌
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.

255
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,270
是啊  留下伤疤就有意思了
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

256
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,830
可不是嘛  伤痛  我喜欢
Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain, love it.

257
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,820
这下好了  谁让他进来的?
Oh, great, who let him in?

258
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,810
开始吧  表现最佳的新兵
Lets get started. The recruit who does best,

259
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,040
将有幸在全村人面前
will win the honor of killing his first

260
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,120
亲手屠龙
dragon in front of the entire village.

261
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,860
卡嗝都已经杀了一条夜煞了
Hiccup already killed a night fury,

262
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,900
这么说他失去资格还是...?
so does that disqualify him or...?

263
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,240
我能不能转到与真正的维京人一个班?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool vikings?

264
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,660
别担心  你个子小又单薄
Don't worry. You're small and you're weak,

265
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,400
最不容易被攻击
that will make you a less of a target.

266
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,350
它们会以为你是病患或者疯子
They'll see you as sick or insane and go

267
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,760
转而进攻那些维京少年
after the more viking-like teens instead.

268
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,560
这扇门后面藏着不同种的龙
Behind these doors are just a few of the

269
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,140
你们要学会如何击败它们
many species you will learn to fight.

270
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,380
-致命奈德龙  -速度  8  护甲  16
- The Deadly Nadder.  - Speed: 8, Armor: 16.

- The Terrible Terror. - Attack: 8, Venom: 12.

274
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,880
能不能闭嘴
Can you stop that!

275
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,280
-还有巨齿龙  -下颚攻击力  8
- And the Gronckle. - Jaw Strength: 8.

276
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,790
等等  你不先教教我们吗
Woah, woah, wait, aren't you going to teach us first?

277
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,850
我认为  实战出真理
I believe in learning on the job.

278
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,370
今天是生存训练
Today is about survival.

279
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,680
被撞倒就死定了
If you get blasted, you're dead.

280
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,550
动作快  你首先最需要什么
Quick! What's the first thing you're going to need?

281
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,150
-医生?  -速度值加5?
- A doctor? - 5 speed?

282
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,080
-盾?  -盾  去拿
- A shield? - shield. Go.

283
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,950
如果在盾与剑之间选择
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield.

284
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,000
还是要优先选择盾
If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield.

285
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,290
举起盾牌
Take the shield.

286
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,430
-这是我的盾  -那里还有好多盾
- Get your hands off my shield. - There's like a million shields.

287
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,800
拿那个  上面有花  女孩子都喜欢花
Take that one. It has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.

288
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,190
现在这上面有血花了
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

289
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,180
悍夫奈和暴芙奈  你俩出局了
Tuffnut, Ruffnut, your out.

290
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,180
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

291
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,030
这些盾还有一个用途  干扰
Those shields are good for another thing. Noise.

292
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,380
虚虚实实  躲开龙的攻击
Make lots of it and throw off a dragon's aim.

293
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,000
每条龙都有攻击次数限制
All dragons have a limited number of shots.

294
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,150
巨齿龙能攻击几次?
How many does a gronckle have?

295
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,890
-五次?  -不  六次
- Five? - No, six.

296
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,940
对  六次  正好你们六个
Right, six. That's one for each of you.

297
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,450
小鱼脚  出局

我说  我搬到地窖里了

鼻涕唠  你出局了

303
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,000
-好像就剩我俩了  -不  只有你

最后一击
One shot left.

305
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,630
卡嗝
Hiccup!

306
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,890
六击结束  回去睡觉吧  你这头肥猪

记住  龙  总是...

309
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,560
无时无刻地寻求杀戮
... always go for the kill.

310
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,280
你为什么不杀我
So why didn't you?

311
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,840
这太愚蠢了
Well this was stupid.

312
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,150
你怎么不飞走
Why don't you just fly away?

313
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,930
雅丝翠  你今天的问题出在哪儿
Alright, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?

314
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,610
俯身时机不对  太草率
I mistimed my sommersault dive. It was sloppy.

315
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,270
它看穿了我的翻身
It threw off my reverse tumble.

316
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,590
-我们注意到了  -不  做得好  这就是你的风格

317
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,590
他说得对  你得坚持
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.

318
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,020
卡嗝的问题出在哪儿
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

319
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,730
-他就不该来吗  -他居然没被吃了
- Uh, he showed up? - He didn't get eaten.

320
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,720
他从来都找不准位置
He's never where he should be.

321
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,170
谢了  雅丝翠  你们得慢慢消化

书上没有关于夜煞的记载

或者关于夜煞的小册子

我给你来一下如何

该怎么偷偷接近夜煞?

我知道  只是假设而已...

阳光太刺眼了  雅丝翠
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

我能怎样  遮住太阳吗
What do you want me to do? Block out the sun?

385
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,490
我能做到  但现在没时间
I can do that. I don't have time right now.

386
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,290
-有人见过龙打盹吗  -卡嗝
- Has anyone ever seen one napping? - Hiccup!

387
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,360
卡嗝

-战场上爱的火花  -她能行的

让我来...你为什么不...

390
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,590
漂亮  雅丝翠
Well done, Astrid.

391
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,610
你是在儿戏吗
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

392
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,240
我们迟早要接过父辈的旗帜
Our parent's war is about to become ours.

393
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,480
想清楚你站在哪边
Figure out which side your on.

394
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,880
你没牙齿吗
Huh? Toothless.

395
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,580
我明明记得你应该有...
I could of sworn you have...

396
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,920
牙齿
... teeth.

397
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,300
不  不  不
Uh, uh,... no, no,... no...

398
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,070
我...我没有鱼啦
I... I don't have anymore.

399
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,640
接着它一转身  一口咬下我的手
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole.

400
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,000
从它的眼神我知道  我一定很美味
And I saw the look in his face. I was delicious.

401
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,080
它一定跟其它龙说过  因为一个月内
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month

402
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,180
另一条龙吃了我的腿
Before another one of them took my leg.

403
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,910
你的手在龙腹中感觉不奇怪吗
Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon?

404
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,830
要是你的大脑依然可以控制它
Like, if your mind was still in control of it,

405
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,660
你大可从龙腹里把它宰了
you could have killed the dragon from the inside.

406
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,990
把龙心碾碎  或者怎么怎么的
By crushing his heart or something.

407
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,100
我发誓  我现在生气极了
I swear, I'm so angry right now.

408
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,070
我一定要为你的手脚报仇
I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

409
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,530
我会砍下所遇到每条龙的腿...认真的!
I'll chop of the legs of every dragon l fight... with my face!

410
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,620
你要砍的是龙翼和龙尾
No. It's the wings and the tails you really want.

411
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,240
如果它飞不了  就无路可逃
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

412
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,020
不能飞的龙  就是死龙一条
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

413
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,290
好吧  我去睡觉了
Alright, I'm off to bed.

414
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,100
你们也早点睡  明天要对付大家伙
You should be too. Tomorrow we get to the big boys.

415
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,990
虽然进步缓慢  但我们还是到了凶煞梦魇
Slowly but surely, making our way up to monstrous nightmare.

416
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,170
谁能有幸宰了它呢
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

417
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,910
肯定是我  这是命  明白吗
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

418
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,470
你妈同意你纹身吗
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

419
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,220
不是纹身  是胎记
It's not a tattoo. It's a birth mark.

420
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,290
你出生时我就跟你在一起
Okay, I've been stuck with you since

421
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,940
怎么没看到
birth and that was never there before.

422
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,210
你没从左边看而已
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me to the left side until now.

423
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,460
无牙仔  我给你带了早餐
Hey, toothless. I brought breakfast.

424
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,480
那个...希望你有胃口
I hope... I hope you're hungry.

425
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,240
好吧  这挺恶心的
Okay, that's disgusting.

426
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,050
我带了些鲑鱼  一些美味的冰岛鳕鱼
I got some salmon, some nice lcelandic cod,

427
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,340
还有整条熏鳗鱼
and a whole smoked eel.

428
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,510
不要吗  好吧
No, no, no, no,... no.... okay.

429
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,730
好吧  我也不怎么喜欢鳗鱼
Yeah, I don't really like eel much either.

430
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,980
对了  这样很好  忽视我的存在
That's it. That's the good stuff. Aah, don't you mind me.

431
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,890
我还是来这关心我的事
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.

432
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,550
没事的...
Its okay...

433
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,290
没事  没事...
Okay, okay...

434
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,450
搞定  不差嘛  挺有用的
Okay, that's not too bad. It works.

435
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,050
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no... !

436
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,030
天呐  成功了
Oh my... its working!

437
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,800
我做到了
Yes, yes, I did it.

438
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,010
今天练习团队配合
Today, is about teamwork.

439
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,860
龙头要是被淋湿  他就不能喷火了
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.

440
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,840
凶恶双头龙极度狡猾
The hideous zippleback is extra tricky.

441
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,150
一个头喷气  一个头点火
One head breathes gas. The other head lights it.

442
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,020
你们要分出龙头的功能
Your job is to know which is which.

443
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,670
锋利的牙齿  喷射出毒液  来腐蚀食物
Razor-sharp serrated teeth, and injects venom for predigestion.

444
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
更喜欢伏击  踩碎食物
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims.

445
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,670
闭嘴好吗
Will you please stop that?!

446
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,880
不管哪个龙头出现  我都要...
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...

447
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
在那儿
There!

448
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,250
是我们  白痴
Hey, its us, idiots!

449
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,530
你屁股越来越挺了  我们看成龙了
Your butts are getting bigger we thought you were a dragon.

450
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,840
那曲线看起来就像是龙屁...
Not that theres anything wrong with a dragon-ass fig...

451
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,350
等等...
Wait...

452
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,320
我受伤了  我很受伤
Oh!... oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

453
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,550
生存几率微乎其微
Chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now.

454
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,770
不是这个头
Oh! Wrong head.

455
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,790
小鱼脚
Fishlegs!

456
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,730
就是现在  卡嗝
Now Hiccup!

457
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,700
拜托
Aww, come on...

458
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,490
卡嗝
Hiccup!

459
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,310
退后  退后
Back,... Back, back!

460
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,090
我话不说两遍
Now don't you make me tell you again!

461
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,230
对  没错  回到洞里去吧
Yes, thats right. Back into your cage!

462
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,300
好好反省一下
Now think about what you've done.

463
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,840
那么  训练结束了吗
Okay, sooo, were we done?

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,180
我还有事要去...
Cause I have some things I need to uh...

嗨
Hey!

467
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,620
-什么情况  -你怎么做到的
- What was that? - How did you do that?

468
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,120
我把斧子留在竞技场了  你们先走
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead.

469
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,450
我回头再找你们
I'll catch up with you.

470
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,120
来会会极度恐惧
Meet the Terrible Terror.

471
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,620
哈  这大小就好像我的...
Ha! It's like the size of my...

472
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,280
把它弄掉
Oooh!... Get it off!

473
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,420
好疼  疼死了
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

太棒了
Ooh, great.

477

卡嗝
Hiccup.

478
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,770
卡嗝  是你吗
Hiccup? Are you in there?

479
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,280
雅丝翠  嗨  雅丝翠  你好呀
Astrid, hey. Hi, Astrid. Hi astrid. Hi Astrid

480
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,730
我一般不多管别人闲事  但你的举止真是很诡异
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.

481
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,350
好吧  更诡异了
Well, weirder.

482
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,810
你好歹找到了巢穴吧
Well, I trust you found the nest at least?

483
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,290
连影子都没有
Not even close.

484
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,960
棒极了
Excellent.

485
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,290
希望你这里有点好消息
I hope you had a little more success than me.

486
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,110
如果你的好消息是指
Well, if by success, you mean that your

487
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,570
身为家长不用再头痛了

488
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,920

恭喜你  史推克  大家都松了口气 
Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved.

490
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,750
从头到尾  焕然一新哈
Out with the old, and in with the new, right?

491
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,200
没人会想念以前那个旧麻烦
No one will miss that old nuisance.

492
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,600
村子要举办一场晚会来庆祝
The village is throwing a party to celebrate.

493
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,330

He's gone?

494
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,560
下午一般都不在  但这又不能怪他
Um, yeah, most afternoons, but who can blame him?

495
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,730
我是说  做一个名人可不容易啊
I mean, the life of a celebrity is very rough.

496
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,520
他现在每次经过村子
He can barely walk through the village

497
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,240
都被一群新粉丝围堵
without being swarmed by his new fans.

498
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,610
-卡嗝?  -谁会想到呢
- Hiccup? - Who would have thought it, eh?

499
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,070
他对付那群野兽自有一套
He has this way with the beasts.

500

停下
Stop!

512
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,620
不
No!

513
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,550
我的天啊
Oh, gosh! Oh, God!

514
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,000
不
Oh no!

515
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,220
好吧  你要自己调整角度
Alright. Okay. You gotta kinda angle yourself!

516
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,590
不不不  回到下面来接我
Okay. No, no, no... come back down towards me.

不  谢谢  我不饿
Uh, no thanks. I'm good.

520
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,530
里面也不怎么防火吧
Not so fire-proof on the inside, are you?

521
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,120
给你
Here you go.

522
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,740
我们根本就不了解你们
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.

523
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,800
爸爸  你回来了
Dad, you're back!

你觉得你能瞒我多久呢
Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?

530
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,360
我  我不知道你
I... I don't know what you...

531
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:39,640
无论岛上发生什么  都逃不过我的眼睛
Nothing happens on this island, without me hearing about it.

532
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:47,370
那么  我们谈谈龙吧
So, lets talk... about that dragon

533
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,510
爸爸  对不起
Dad, I'm so sorry.

534
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,910

00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,630
第一次把巨齿龙的头挂在长矛上

欧丁神  真不容易  我差点就放弃你了
Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you.

543

原来你一直瞒着我
And all the while you were holding out on me.

544
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,730
伟大的托尔雷神
Oh, Thor almighty!

545

我知道  这看起来是很糟  但是...

好吧  你是对的
You're right. You're right. You're right.

589
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,040
我一直在撒谎
I... I'm through with the lies.

590
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,370
我一直在做额外装备
I've been making... outfits!

591
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:48,220
好吧  被你发现了  那就告诉大家好了
So, you got me. It's time everyone knew.

592
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,470
拖我回去  走吧  我们走吧
Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.

593
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,350
你为什么要这样
Oww. Why would you do that?

594
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,520
这下是为那些谎话
That's for the lies!

595
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,660
而这下  是为所有其它事
And that's... for everything else!

596
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,370
惨了
Oh man.

597
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,350
趴下
Get down!

598
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,670
快跑  快跑
Run! Run!

599
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,010
不  没事的  没事  她是朋友
No! No! it's okay. It's okay. She's a friend.

600
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,210
你吓到他了
You just scared him.

601
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,260
反而是我吓到他了?!
I scared him?

602
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,760
他是谁
Who is him?

603
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,510
雅丝翠  这是无牙仔  无牙仔  这是雅丝翠
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

604
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,480
我们死定了
Dut, da da... we're dead.

605
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,730
你这是想去哪儿
Woah, woah woah. Where do you think your going?

606
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,480
伟大的欧丁神  不要  这...
Oh, great Odin! Don't. Oh, this is...

607
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,610
卡嗝  把我放下来
Hiccup, get me down from here!

608
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,120
那你先听我解释
You have to give me a chance to explain.

609
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,820
我才不要听你解释
I am not listening to anything you have to say!

610
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,940
那我不用说的  你只要看着就好
Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

611
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,230
求你了  雅丝翠
Please, Astrid.

612
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,670
快带我下去
Now get me down!

613
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,430
无牙仔  下去吧  温柔点
Toothless, down. Gently.

614
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,230
我说吧  没什么好怕的
See, nothing to be afraid of.

615
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,770
无牙仔
Toothless?

616
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,080
你抽什么疯  你真不乖
What is wrong with you? Bad dragon!

617
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,540
他平时不会这样
He's uh, he's not usually like this.

618
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,940
哦  不
Oh, no!

619
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,160
无牙仔  你在搞什么  我们得给她留下好印象
Toothless, what are you doing? We need her to like us!

620
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,180
好吧  他在旋转了
And now he's spinning!

621
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,180
你根本毫无帮助  你个没用的爬虫
Thank you for nothing you useless reptile!

622
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,530
好吧  我错了  拜托快让我下来
Okay, I am sorry, I'm sorry. Just get me off of this thing.

623
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,440
好吧  我承认  这真是酷
Alright, I admit it. This is pretty cool.

624
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,020
真是不可思议  他也是
It's amazing. He's amazing.

625
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,920
现在怎么办
So what now?

626
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,340
卡嗝  明天就是你最后的考试
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow!

627
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,480
你心里也清楚吧
You know your gonna have to kill a...

628
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,400
你要杀死一条龙
Kill a dragon...

629
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,080
不用提醒我
Don't remind me.

630
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,990
无牙仔  怎么了
Toothless, what happening?

631
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,080
怎么回事
Whoa, what is it?

632
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:28,170
低下身子
Get down!

633
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,260
-怎么回事  -我不知道
- What's going on? - I don't know.

634
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,840
无牙仔  你得带我们出去  伙计
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.

635
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,400
他们好像在搬运猎物
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

636
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,770
这跟我们有关系吗
What does that make us?

637
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,940
我爸爸绝不会想到是这种地方
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

638
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,900
我们的食物就这么被扔进洞里
Oh, it's satisfying to know that all of

639
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,110
看到还真是让人感到欣慰
our food has been dumped down a hole.

640
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,420
他们一点都没吃
They're not eating any of it.

641
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,540
那是什么东西
What... was that?

642
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,560
好吧  伙计  我们得从这出去  马上
Alright, bud, we gotta get out of here. Now!

643
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,450
不  这就说得通了  这就好像一个大蜂巢
No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive.

644
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,430
他们是工蜂  而那就是他们的蜂后
They're the workers, and that's their queen.

645
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,240
正是它统治着他们  我们去找你爸爸
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

646
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,630
不  不
No, no.

647
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,160
不  还不行  他们会杀了无牙仔
No. Not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

648
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,160
雅丝翠  我们得好好想一想
Astrid, we have to think this through, carefully.

649
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,920
卡嗝  我们刚发现了龙的巢穴
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragon's nest.

650
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,770
自从最早的一批祖先定居此地  我们便一直在寻找
The thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here.

651
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,570
现在你却要隐瞒不说
And you want to keep it secret?

652
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,980
就为了保护你的宠物  那条龙吗  你是认真的吗
To protect your pet, dragon? Are you serious?

653
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,160
是的
Yes.

654
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,010
好吧  那我们怎么办
Okay. Then what do we do?

655
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,380
给我点时间  明天我会想法子
Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

656
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,160
好吧
Okay....

657
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,690
这下是因为你绑架我
That's for kidnapping me.

658
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:43,010
这下  是为了所有其它事
That's for... everything else.

659
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,300
你看什么看
What are you looking at?

660
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,610
好吧  我又可以在公共场合露面了
Well, I can show my face in public again.

661
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,780
要是以前有人告诉我
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks

662
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,950
卡嗝会在短短数周内  摇身一变
Hiccup will go from, well being... uh... Hiccup,

663
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,320
成为降龙训练中的佼佼者
to placing first in dragon training.

664
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:22,330
我会把他绑在桅杆上
Well, I would have tied him to a mast and

665
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,410
再开船把他送走  因为他肯定疯得不轻
shipped him off. For fear he'd gone mad.

666
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,540
你们也知道
And you know it.

667
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,040
而此时此刻
But, here we are.

668
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:35,760
没有人比我更加倍感自豪与惊叹
And no ones more surprised or more proud than I am.

669
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,210
今天  我的儿子成长为一名真正的维京海盗
Today my boy becomes a Viking!

670
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,110
今天  他已成为我们其中一员
Today he becomes one of us!

671
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,720
小心那条龙
Be careful with that dragon.

672
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,740
我担心的不是龙
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

673
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,090
你要怎么办
What are you going to do?

674
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,520
了结这一切
Put an end to this.

675
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,970
我必须试一下
I have to try.

676
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,210
雅丝翠  要是出了意外
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

677
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:03,060
确保他们不会找到无牙仔
just make sure they don't find Toothless.

678
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:07,650
我会的  但你要保证不出意外
I will, just promise me it won't go wrong.

679
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:08,740
是时候了  卡嗝
It's time, Hiccup.

680
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,480
将它们打个一败涂地
Knock 'em dead.

681
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,780
要我肯定选那把锤子
I'd have gone for the hammer.

682
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,680
准备好了
I'm ready.

683
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,270
上吧  卡嗝  给它点颜色看看
Go on Hiccup, give it to him!

684
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,880
他在做什么
What is he doing?

685
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,820
没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

686
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,600
我和他们不同
I'm not one of them.

687
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,670
停止这场打斗
Stop the fight!

688
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,000
不  我要你们亲眼见证
No! I need you all to see this.

689
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,910
他们不是我们想的那样
They're not what we think they are.

690
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,000
我们不用非得杀了他们
We don't have to kill them.

691
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,380
我说停止战斗
I said stop the fight!

692
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,030
让开
Out of my way!

693
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,210
卡嗝
Hiccup!

694
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,300
卡嗝
Hiccup!

695
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,420
这边
This way!

696
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,450
夜煞
Night fury!

697
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,480
好了  无牙仔  离开这儿
Alright, Toothless. Go! get out of here.

698
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,210
快走
Go, go!

699
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:16,540
不  爸爸  他不会伤害你
No, dad! dad, he won't hurt you!

700
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,720
无牙仔  住手  
Toothless, stop!

701
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,290
不  不
No. No!

702
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,560
抓住它
Get him!

703
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,400
不  请别伤害它
No, no, please. Just don't hurt him

704
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,720
请别伤害它
Please. Don't hurt him

705
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,250
把它和其它龙关在一起
Put it with the others.

706
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,970
我早该知道
I should have known.

707
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,720
我早该看出迹象
I should have seen the signs.

708
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,450
-爸爸  -我们有过约定
- Dad? - We had a deal!

709
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,920
我知道  但那时我...
I know! We did, but that was before I...

710
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,410
好吧  一切都糟透了
oh, it's all so messed up.

711
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,860
竞技场的那一切...都是诡异和谎言吗
So everything in that ring... A trick? A lie?

712
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,790
我搞砸了  我早该告诉你
I screwed up. I should have told you before now.

713
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,580
是我的错  冲我发火吧  但是求你
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please,

714
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,070
别伤害无牙仔
just don't hurt Toothless.

715
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,150
那条龙吗  你担心的就是这个吗
The dragon? That's what you're worried about?

716
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,240
那些差点被你害死的人呢
Not the people you almost killed?

717
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,390
他只是在保护我  他并不危险
He was just protecting me! he's not dangerous.

718
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,900
它们杀害了无数我们的族人
They've killed hundreds of us!

719
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,100
但我们杀了更多他的同伴
And we've killed thousands of them.

720
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:24,150
他们只是为了自卫  仅此而已
They defend themselves, that's all.

721
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,130
他们袭击我们是迫不得已
They raid us because they have to.

722
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,610
如果他们不带食物回去
If they don't bring enough food back,

723
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,110
就会被吃掉
they'll be eaten themselves.

724
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,730
他们的岛上有别的东西
There's something else on their island,

725
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,180
爸爸  有一条龙  他...
Dad. It's a dragon-like...

726
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,750
它们的岛屿?  你去过它们的巢穴吗
Their island? So, you've been to the nest?

727
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,870
-我有说到巢穴吗  -你怎么找到的?
- Did I say nest? - How did you find it?

728
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,260
不  我没有  是无牙仔带我去的
No, no, I didn't. Toothless did.

729
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,700
只有龙可以找到那个岛
Only a dragon can find the island.

730
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:50,240
不  爸爸  求你了  别这样
No, no, dad, no please. Its not what you think.

731
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,020
你不了解你面对的敌人
You don't know what your up against.

732
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,490
是你前所未见的那种
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

733
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,990
爸爸  我保证  你赢不了它
Dad, please, I promise you. You can't win this one!

734
01:05:58,530 --> 01:05:59,880
爸爸  不要
Dad, no!

735
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,230
哪怕一次也好  你为什么就听不进去我的话呢
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me!

736
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,860
你和它们站在一起
You've thrown your lot in with them.

737
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,120
你不是维京人
You're not a viking.

738
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,620
你也不是我儿子
You're not my son!

739
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,870
备船
Ready the ships!

740
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,340
启航
Set sail!

741
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,750
向地狱犬之门进发
We head for Hell-hounds gate.

742
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,850
恶魔  带我们去你的老巢吧
Lead us home, devil.

743
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,730
糟透了  你一定难受极了
It's a mess. You must feel horrible.

744
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,850
你失去了所有  你父亲
You've lost everything. Your father,

745
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,790
你的部落  你最好的朋友
your tribe, your best friend.

746
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,970
谢谢你的总结
Thank you for summing that up.

747
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,840
我在树林里发现他时
Why couldn't I've killed that dragon,

748
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,780
为什么不干脆杀了他
when I found him the woods?

749
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,450
这样对大家都好
Would've been better for everyone.

750
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,260
对  换作是其他人肯定这么做
Yep, the rest of us would have done it.

751
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,320
为什么你偏偏下不了手
So, why didn't you?

752
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,580
为什么不杀了他
Why didn't you?

753
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,580
我不知道  我做不到
I don't know. I couldn't.

754
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,450
-这个不算答案  -为什么
- That's not an answer. - Why is this

755
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,030
这怎么突然变得对你如此重要
so important to you all of a sudden?

756
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,730
因为我想记住你现在所说的话
Because I want to remember what you say, right now.

757
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,110
老天爷  我是个软弱的胆小鬼
Ah, for the love of... I was coward, I was weak.

758
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,090
我连条龙都不想杀
I wouldn't kill a dragon!

759
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,390
你刚才说你不想杀?
You said wouldn't that time?

760
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,390
怎么都好  我就是不想
Whatever, I wouldn't!

761
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,410
三百年来  我是第一个
300 years and I'm the first viking

762
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,500
不想杀龙的维京人
who wouldn't kill a dragon.

763
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:49,300
但也是第一个龙骑士
First to ride one though.

764
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,850
所以呢
So?

765
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,800
我下不了手  因为他看起来和我一样害怕
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.

766
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:03,320
我从他身上看到了自己
I looked at him and I saw myself.

767
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,450
我想他现在一定很害怕
I bet he's really frightened now.

768
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,770
你有何打算
What are you gonna do about it?

769
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,930
做一些蠢事吧
Probably something stupid.

770
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,200
好吧  蠢事你早就做了
Good, but you've already done that.

771
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,390
那就来一场疯狂的
Then something crazy!

772
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,410
这才像样
That's more like it.

773
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,360
守好位置  保持联系
Sound your positions! stay within earshot.

774
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,700
史推克  我刚才有所耳闻
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of

775
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,790
一些船员...
the men just now and well, you know,...

776
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,580
对我们要去哪儿表示疑惑
some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here?

777
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,080
当然不包括我
Not me of course.

778
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,960
我知道你总会计划周详
I know you are always the man with the plan.

779
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:50,310
但是一些除我以外的人在疑惑
But some, not me, are wondering if

780
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:52,360
你是否有所计划
there is in fact a plan at all...

781
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,660
如果有  是什么计划呢
and what it might be?

782
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,460
找到龙巢  击溃它
Find the nest and take it.

783
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,990
当然  把它们放跑
Of course. Send them running.

784
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,980
老海盗的后备计划  简单而有效
The old viking fallback. Nice and simple.

785
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:11,960
靠边
Step aside.

786
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,980
驶向港口
Head to port.

787
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,000
你是想要被吃了吧
If you're planning on getting eaten,

788
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,850
我一定要和巨齿龙一起去
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

789
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,500
要是你脑袋灵光
You were wise to seek help

790
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,070
就得求助世界上最致命的武器
from the world's most deadly weapon.

791
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,320
那就是我
It's me.

792
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,720
-我喜欢这个计划  -我不...
- I love this plan! - I didn't...

793
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,550
你太疯狂了  我就喜欢这点
You're crazy. I like that.

794
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,600
那么  是什么计划
So, what is the plan?

795
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,390
这可不怎么有利于士气
That's not very encouraging.

796
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:06,150
难怪一直不见船回来
Oh, I was wondering where that went.

797
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,300
保持低姿  备好兵器
Stay low, and ready your weapons.

798
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:38,990
我们到了
We're here.

799
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,480
等等  你在干什么...
Wait, what are you...?!

800
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,130
没事的
It's okay... it's okay.

801
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,740
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

802
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:32,550
得加一些东西帮你驾住龙
You're gonna need something to help you hold on.

803
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,730
我们敲破山门
When we crack this mountain open,

804
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,820
所有龙就会蜂拥而出
all hell is gonna break loose.

805
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,570
好吧  幸好我带了备用的底衣
... in my undies. Good thing I brought extras.

806
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,060
无论结果如何  今天要做个了断
No matter how this ends, it ends today.

807
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,980
结束了吗
Is that it?

808
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,020
我们胜利了
We've done it!

809
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,030
还没完
This isn't over!

810
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,460
列阵  拉石弹弓
Form your ranks. Pull together!

811
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,450
快撤
Get clear!

812
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:35,120
我滴雷神啊...那是什么东西
Beards of thor,... ! what is that?

813
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,070
欧丁神保佑
Odin, help us!

814
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,870
发射石弹
Catapults! Fire!

815
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,790
-回到船上去  -不
- Get to the ships! - No, nooo!

816
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,600
-好吧  那艘起火了  -我真蠢
- Not that one... - I was a fool.

817
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,990
带着大家逃到岛的远端
Lead the men to the far side of the island.

818
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,390
嘉伯  你也一起走
Gobber, go with the men.

819
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,990
我要留下看着你
I think I'll stay, just in case you're

820
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,350
免得你做出什么疯狂之举
thinking of doing something crazy.

821
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:22,140
只要我引开那个东西
I can buy them a few minutes if I give

822
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,580
就能拖延一点时间  让他们逃脱
that thing something to hunt for.

823
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:26,390
那加我一个岂不更好
Then I can double that time.

824
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,840
-来啊  -这边
- Here! - Oh, no. Here!

825
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,370
-跟我打  -不  跟我打
- Fight me! - No, me!

826
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,280
悍夫  暴芙  注意身后
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs!

827
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,070
跟上  小鱼脚
Move, Fishlegs!

828
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:01,910
看啊  我们骑着龙  全都骑着龙
Look at us! we're on dragons! We're on dragons! All of us!

829
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:10,620
你那顽固的维京死脑筋能想得到吗
Every bit the bull-headed stubborn viking you ever were.

830
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,070
-小鱼脚  上去攻击  -好
- Fishlegs, break it down! - Okay.

831
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:16,240
头尾的重甲是为了
Heavily armored skull and tail made for

832
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,080
猛击和废碎敌人
bashing and crushing. Steer clear of both.

833
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,520
小眼大鼻孔  说明它主要依靠听力和嗅觉
Small eyes, large nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell.

834
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,800
好  阿唠和阿脚  留在它的盲点
Okay, Lout, Legs, hang in it's blind spot.

835
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,540
弄些噪音扰乱它
Make some noise. Keep it confused.

836
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:28,180
悍夫和暴芙  想法子找出它的死角
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit.

837
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:28,570
激怒它
Make it mad.

838
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,070
-那是我的专长  -扯吧你
- That's my specialty! - Since when?

839
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,930
地球人都知道我更会气人
Everyone knows I'm more irritating, see.

840
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,750
照我说的做  我尽快回来
Just do what I told you. I'll be back as soon as I can.

别担心  我们来掩护你
Don't worry! We got it covered!

842
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,270
-傻瓜  -呆子
- Fool! - Butto!

843
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,610
再见  你个螺栓
Bye, ya grendel!

844
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,120
这个东西没有死角
Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!

845
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:03,880
那儿
There!

846

去帮他们吧
Go help the others!

847
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,350
好  坚持住
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

848
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,240
-起作用了  -没错
- It's working! - Yeah, its working!

849
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,040
我控制不了巨齿龙了  
I've lost power on the Gronckle!

850
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,700
鼻涕唠  别光傻看着
Snotlout, do something!

851
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:40,640
我很好
I'm okay!

852
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:42,900
好才怪
Less okay.

853
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,300
错不了  怎么了  伙计  
I can't miss! Whats wrong, buddy?

854

眼睛里进东西了吗
You got something in your eye?

855

你真有海盗的范儿
Yeah, you're the viking!

856
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,790
爸爸
Dad?

857

你不必去那儿
You don't have to go up there.

863
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,150
我们是海盗  这是职业病
We're vikings. It's an occupational hazard

864
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:14,890

去把鼻涕唠救出来
Get Snotlout outta there!

868
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,340
-这是我的活  -我先干的
- I'm on it! - I'm on it first!

869
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,510
喂  让我来骑
Hey, let me drive!

870
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,510
-别推我  -我要把你牙敲出来
- Don't push me! - I'll push your teeth out!

871
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,850
不敢相信居然有效
You know, I can't believe that worked.

872
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:52,410
-夜煞  -趴下
- Night fury! - Get down!

873
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,210

01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:19,890
这家伙有翅膀  好吧  看看它能不能飞
This thing has wings. Okay, lets see if it can use them!

876
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,630
你觉得那招有效吗
You think that did it?

877
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:44,460
它会飞
Well, he can fly.

878
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,450
好了  无牙仔  该消失了  上吧  伙计

879
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,190
来吧
Here it comes!

880
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,560
小心
Watch out!

881
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:15,300
好了  时间到  看看是否有效
Okay, times up. Let's see if this works.

882
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,270
来吧  你就这点能耐吗
Come on! Is that the best you can do?

883
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:40,510
振作一点  我们真棒  再坚持一会儿
Stay with me, buddy. We're good. Just a little bit longer.

884

准备  无牙仔  就是现在
Hold, Toothless. Now!

885
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:15,180

卡嗝
Hiccup! Hiccup!

887

儿子
Son!

01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,570
卡嗝

889
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,170
儿子
Oh son!

890
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,510

我...我很抱歉
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

892
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,270
卡嗝
Hiccup!

893
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,230
他还活着  你把他活着带回来了
He's alive! you brought him back alive!

894
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,980
谢谢你...救了我儿子

算是救回来了吧
Well, you know, most of him.

01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,300
你好  无牙仔
Hey, Toothless.

你在我的房间里
You're in my house.

900
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,030
我爸爸知道你在这儿吗
Does my dad know your here?

901
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,110
好吧...好吧
Uh, what, oh, okay,... okay.

902
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,760
无牙仔  别这样  好吧
Toothless, no. Toothless! Aw, come on.

903
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:45,320
好吧  谢谢你  小家伙
Okay. Thanks, bud.

904
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,510
无牙仔  待着别动
Toothless, stay here.

905
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,940
来吧  伙计们  准备好  抓紧  我们走
C'mon guys. Get ready! hold on tight. Here we go!

906
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:05,760
什么
What?

907
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,580
我就知道  这不是真的吧
I knew it. I'm dead.

908
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,540
当然是  你干得很出色
No, but you give it your best shot.

909
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,520
你觉得如何
So, what do you think?

910
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,160
看  是卡嗝
Hey look, it's Hiccup!

911
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:25,610
卡嗝
Hiccup!

912
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:31,680
事实证明  我们只需做一下改变
It turns out, all we needed was a little more of... this.

913
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,970
你又擅自替我决定了吗
You just gestured to all of me?

914
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,280
不全都是  那腿是我的杰作
Well, most of you. That bit's my handiwork.

915
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,820
再加上一点卡嗝的光耀  
With a little Hiccup flare thrown in.

916
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:41,750
你觉得好用吗
You think that'll do?

917
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,150
看来我还得做些调节
I might make a few tweaks.

918
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,950
这一下  是因为你害我担心
That's... for scaring me.

919
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,420
你以后不能总这样  因为...
What... what, is it always going to be this way? Because...

920
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,890
我想我能习惯
I could get used to it.

921
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,680
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

922
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:02,090
-夜煞  -趴下
- Night fury! - Get down!

准备好了吗
You ready?

924
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,720
这里是伯克村
This is Berk...

925
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,320
一年中九个月下雪  其它三个月下冰雹
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.

926
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,810
这儿生长的食物坚硬无味
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.

927
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:33,050
这儿的人更是有过之而无不及
The people that grow here are even more so.

928
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,470
唯一的好处就是宠物
The only upsides are the pets.

929
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,380
其它地方有小马或鹦鹉...
While other places have ponies or parrots...

930
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,540
而我们有...
We have...

931
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:51,680
龙
Dragons
