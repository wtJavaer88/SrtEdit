Daddy is not gonna be home for a while.

16
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:55,873
我不明白
I don't understand.

17
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,288
<i>你也不能再回家里去 知道了么 Penny</i>
<i>You can't go back to the house, Penny. Okay?</i>

18
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,658

就是他 卡利科博士!
There he is, doctor Calico!

27
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:08,830
有没有运气能激发我们客人的勇气?
Any luck getting our guest to spill his guts?

28
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,724
<i>噢 会激发出他的勇气来的</i>

29
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,595

<i>你是在激怒我 教授 我很生气</i>
<i>You're beginning to urge me profesor, I'm urged.</i>

33
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,881
<i>但这无济于事 一旦包裹到达...</i>
<i>And that will not do. As the package arrived...</i>

34
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:33,626
<i>我想我们亲爱的朋友 会更容易沟通...</i>
<i>...I think it might make our dear friend a bit more communicative.</i>

35
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,766
我正派人去把它取来
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

36
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:41,158
<i>太好了 让他做头班飞机带给我</i>
<i>Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me on the first flight.</i>

37
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,776

38
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,952
<i>我们只要那女孩!</i>
<i>We only need the girl!</i>

39
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,640

00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:12,014
靠近罗加瓜多湖
Near lake Rogaguado!

43
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:15,622
罗加瓜多湖? 我早该想到的
Lake Rogaguado? I should have known!

44
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,329
来吧 Bolt 我们走
Come on Bolt, let's go.

45
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,454
玻利维亚 10分钟后有一班飞机去那儿
Bolivia, there is a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

46
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:07,319
Bolt 急速移动!
Bolt, zoom zoom!

47
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,199
Bolt 去取回来
Bolt, prinde.

48

去机场!
Airport!

52
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,128
Bolt 狮子吼
Bolt, speak.

53
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,908
好了
Okay, okay...

54
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:39,616
干得漂亮 伙计
Good job, buddy.

55
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:42,429
任务完成!
Mission accomplished!

56
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,348
那是个守卫
That's a keeper!

57
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:51,366
没事了 硬汉 你把他们都抓住了
It's allright tough guy, you caught them all.

58
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:58,397
没事啦 Bolt 你又一次拯救了世界
Don't worry Bolt, you've saved the day again.

59
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:15,852
<i>好孩子!</i>
<i>Good boy!</i>

60
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,464
<i>去机场!</i>
<i>Airport!</i>

61
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:28,217
<i>Bolt 狮子吼</i>
<i>Bolt, speak.</i>

62
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,224
麦克风吊杆!
Boom mike!

63
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:33,976
- 有一个传声器架 - 是个传声器架
- We got a boom mike. - That's a boom mike.

64
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,846
真糟糕
That's sloppy.

65
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:41,896
狗会看见这个的 他可能已经看见了!
The dog could've seen that. He could've seen that!

66
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,397
就算是狗看到了又怎样?
Uh, who cares if the dog sees a boom mike?

67
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:51,251
请允许我先问一句...
Forgive me for answering a question with a question,...

68
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:54,619
你又是谁?
...but who are you?

69
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,231
联播网的明迪・帕克
Mindy Parker, from the network.

70
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,122
当然 我来问你 联播网的明迪・帕克
Of course. Let me ask you, Mindy from the network...

71
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,737
你从这里看到了什么?
What do you see here?

72
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,820
- 呃 小狗? - 她说"小狗"
- Uhh... the dog? - "The dog" she says.

73
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:14,638
噢 明迪 可怜的明迪
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor Mindy.

74
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:17,432
我说错什么了么?
Am I missing something?

75
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,137
你大错特错了 明迪
You're missing everything, Mindy.

76
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:24,335
你看见的是一只狗 我看见的是这样一个动物
You see a dog. I see an animal that believes...

77
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:28,565
他全心全意相信
...with every fiber of his being, every fiber...

78
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:31,658
他爱的女孩处在最危险的关头
...that the girl he loves is in mortal danger.

79
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,541
狗的表情里流露出的深沉情感
I see a depth of emotion on the face of that canine the likes of which...

80
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:38,043
此前从未在荧幕上出现过
...has never been captured on screen before.

81
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,517
从未啊 联播网的明迪
Never, Mindy from the network.

82
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:46,845
我们就是要让他相信 这一切都是真实的
We jump through hoops to make sure Bolt believes everything is real.

83
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:50,460
这就是为什么 我们不用场记 不重拍
It's why we don't miss marks. It's why we don't reshoot.

84
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,611
这就是为什么我们绝不 让狗看到传声器架
And it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes!

85
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:01,056
因为 联播网的明迪
Because, Mindy from the network,...

86
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:05,123
只有那狗相信...
...if the dog believes it,...

87
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:09,542
观众们才会相信
...the audience believes it.

88
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:15,938
好吧 你想要现实就给你现实
Wow. Okay, you want reality, here you go chief.

89
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,643
这个剧情太老套了
The show's too predictable.

90
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:20,867
女孩有危险 小狗从可怕的英国佬 手里救下她 我们都知道
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her from the creepy english guy, we get it.

91
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:22,518
总是个大团圆的结局
There's always a happy ending.

92
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,629
我们的调查小组称 18到35岁的成人并不满意
And our focus groups tell us 18 to 35 year olds are unhappy.

93
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:27,770
他们不喜欢皆大欢喜的结局
They're not happy with happy.

94
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,542
或许你可以...
So maybe you should, I don't know,...

95
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:32,373
少花点时间担心小狗的行动方式
...spend a little less time worrying about the dog's method acting,...

96
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,998
而多花点时间想想
...and more time figuring out how to stop 20 year olds in Topeka...

97
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,263
如何阻止20岁的人换频道
...from changing the channel.

98
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,982
要是收视率下降半个点...
Because if you lose so much as half a rating point,...

99
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:43,570
我发誓 把你们都炒了 就从你开始!
...so help me, I will fire everyone in this room, starting with you!

100
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,703
这个够现实吧
How's that for real?

101
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:51,234
贴这里 很好
There. Perfect.

102
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,127
你又一次救了我 Bolt
You saved me again, Bolt.

103
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:58,944
好了 没什么的
It's okay, it's nothing.

104
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,945
没有坏人了
No more bad guys.

105
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:04,664
你要吃东西么 你饿不饿?
Do you want some food, Bolty? Huh? Are you hungry?

106
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,796
你把他们都逮住了 Bolt 没人能伤害我了
You've got them, Bolt, no one is gonna hurt me.

107
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:18,202
Bolt 看看我 我没事的 看到没?
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

108
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,847
到这来 伙计 到这来!
Come here buddy, come here!

109
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,960
去 捡回来 Bolt 去呀
Go, get it Bolt! Go, get it!

110
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,066
这个也不好玩了
Yeah, that one is no funny either.

111
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,195
看哪 我们找到什么了?
Well, what we have here?

112
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,480
你的老朋友 胡萝卜先生!
Your old buddy, Mister Carrot!

113
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,991
噢 Bolt!
Oh, Bolt!

114
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:00,702
我得走了
You know I have to go.

115
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,081
真是我的好孩子
Yeah, you are my good boy.

116
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:28,923
在这里啊 我的超级明星
And there she is, my little superstar!

117
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:31,084
我们来为"青少年"杂志 拍张封面照吧
Let's get to that "Teen" vogue cover shoot.

118
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,548
妈妈 我想带Bolt回家度周末
Mam, I wanna take Bolt home for this weekend.

119
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,166
- 这个...我... - 噢 这很好
- Well, I... I'm... - Oh, that be nice. That be great.

120
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,976
会很不错的 小女孩和她的狗
That would. A little girl and her dog.

121
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,256
再好不过了
Nothing better that.

122
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,508
这么说 我能带Bolt回家了?
So I can bring Bolt home?

123
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,359
作为你的朋友 我会说是的 当然可以
As your friend, I say yes, absolutely...

124
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:57,025
但是作为你的经纪人 我得提醒你 对Bolt的规则是
...but as your agent, I have to remind you. This is Bolt's law.

125
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,305
他必须留在这里
He has to stay right here.

126
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,851
好了 我们走
Okay, let's go.

127
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:02,842
但他从没有过过真正的生活
But he never gets to be a real dog.

128
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,679
就一次 这周末带他回家
And it will be only for the weekend and I just once...

129
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:10,302
什么 知道吗 这问题很公平 这么着吧 比方说拿出来个别针
What? You know what? It's a fair question. Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.

130
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,403
别在这 这样就行了 现在让我们先放一放吧
Pin in, there you go. Now, let's let that hang there a little bit...

131
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:16,115
等想通了我们再来讨论 好么?
...and then we'll address that when we thought things through, okay?

132
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:18,017
大家觉得怎么样? 都笑一笑!
Good enough for everybody? Smiles all around!

133
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,270
我们走吧 快点
Let's get out of here. Come on.

134
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:22,857
我不想想那么多 我想带Bolt回家
I don't need to think it through. I wanna take Bolt home.

135
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,085
瞧瞧你可爱的小脸 我家里也有个小女儿
Look at this face! I have a little girl at home,...

136
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,188
我毕生的爱 我愿意为她做任何事
...love of my life. I would do anything for her.

137
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,904
但我还是会心跳不已地拿她和你换!
And I would trade her for you in a heartbeat!

138
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,470
真的
True story.

139
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,602
这提醒我 这就得重新做衣柜了
That reminds me, uh, we need to begin over to wardrobe.

140
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,750
我们走吧
Let's go.

141
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,316
- 我需要... - 我...我只是...
- I need every... - I... I just...

142
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:54,887
这么说 小狗认为这全都是真的?
So, the dog thinks this is all real?

143
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,479
是啊 新鲜吧 这家伙从没离开过片场
Oh, yeah. Hear new. Guy never leaves the set.

144
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,829
难以置信 等有机会 我就把这个公布出来
It's unbelievable. Whenever I get a chance this is the perfect way to unwind.

145
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:07,039
就用邪恶的大笑来开始
I like to start with an evil laugh.

146
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:13,104
嘿 小毛球!
Hello, hairballs!

147
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:17,717
或许今天你赢了 Bolt 但最终
You may have one today Bolt, but in the end...

148
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,845
我们还是会抓到你的小Penny

一旦我找到他 就会让他生不如死
When I find him, I'm gonna make that cat wish never born.

289
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,322
我想我们认得你说的猫
I think we know just the cat.

290
00:29:53,656 --> 00:29:55,715
很准时 索尔 进来吧
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

291
00:29:58,055 --> 00:30:01,752
好 索尔 干得不错 下次给我找点芥末 好吧 ?
Okay, Saul, nice work. Let's find some mustard next time. Okay, babe?

292
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,950
好的 米滕 谢谢你 米滕
Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

293
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:08,663
这是你弄来的全部么 特德?
Is that everything you've pickled, Ted?

294
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:11,532
- 好孩子! - 再见 米滕
- What a boy! - Good day, Mittens.

295
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:15,199
路易!
Louie!

296
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:17,911
这是什么?
What is this?

297
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,280
这星期不景气 这可是我一半的家当
It was a slow week. I mean, that's half of what I got.

298
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,100
你听到了么 路易 我都快饿死了
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

299
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:31,067
要是我的胃开始说话 它就不是跟我说了
And when the old stomach starts talking, it's not talking to me.

300
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:36,297
- 而是跟我的爪子说 - 别举爪子 求求你!
- It's talking to... the claws! - Not the claws! Please!

301
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:41,721
我在努力控制这些坏家伙 但事情也不是全取决于我
I'm holding these bad boys back as best as I can, but the thing is it's not up to me.

302
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,543
胃和爪子之间有一条直线...
The stomach got a direct line to these babies,...

303
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:48,192
而且都在对我喋喋不休呢
...and I'm picking up a lot of chatter!

304
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:51,986
要我和爪子谈的话 作为交换
So, I'll talk to the claws, but in exchange...

305
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:57,129
- 下周 你要交出所有的食物 - 可是我们有约在先的!
...next week, all your food comes to me. - But that's not our deal!

306
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:00,924
我给你一半 你保护我 我们说好的
I bring you half, you give me protection! That's our deal.

307
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,628
那好吧 这个协议已经过期了 现在给我消失
Yeah, well, the deal just expired. Now, get lost.

308
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,072
记住我的话 米滕
Mark my words, Mittens.

309
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:12,985
总有一天 会有人教训你的!
One day, someone's gonna stand up to you! Someone's gonna teach you a lesson!

310
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:15,189
是么 我都要害怕死了
Yeah, I'm really scared now.

311
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,398
你是该害怕!
You should be!

312
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:19,338
哦 好的 你...
Aaah! Okay! You...

313
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:20,434
她在哪?
Where is she?

314
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,534
- 谁? - 你知道我干嘛来的!
- Who? - You know why I'm here!

315
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,085
她在哪?
Where is she?

316
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:29,852
好吧 伙计 我不知道你在找什么...
Okay, okay! Look buddy, I don't know what you're getting at, but...

317
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:34,772
说吧 米滕 告诉这家伙她在哪
Come on, Mittens. Just tell the guy where she is.

318
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:39,041
- 告诉这小狗 别惹他不高兴 - 对啊 说吧 告诉他
- Tell the dog, make him happy. - Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens! Tell him!

319
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,664
乔伊 文尼 鲍比 我的好孩子!
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

320
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:47,725
你们干嘛不告诉这疯狗 他找错了猫?
Would you tell the crazy canine that he's got the wrong cat?

321
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,846
- 你找到她了 伙计! - 就是她!
- You got her, pal! - That's her!

322
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:55,361
- 就是你要找的那只猫! - 绝对是!
- She's the one! - That is definitely the right cat!

323
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:59,078
看来非得用狠招了
Looks like we're gonna do this the hard way.

324
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:03,798
喔 啊 你疯了 哥们
Whoa! Aaah! You're crazy, man!

325
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:08,175
乔伊 我们是不是有点过分了?
Hey Joey, do we go too far on this?

326
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:12,134
开什么玩笑 这是我生命中最好的一天
You kidding? This is the best day in my life.

327
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:15,499
你为本和巴特工作 他们是绿眼人的手下
You work for Ben and Bart, who work with the man green-eye.

328
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,029
他们带走了Penny 她现在在哪?
They take him Penny. Where is she?

329
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,122
- 我不知道你在说什么 - 这让人有点累了...
- I don't know what you're talking about. - This is becoming tiring so cat...

330
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:23,981
事实上 我正想打一个哈欠
...in fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

331
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:28,204
好吧 好吧 我说 我全说 我知道Penny在哪
Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk. I know where Penny is.

332
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:29,854
没错 他们抓住了她
Yeah, they have her.

333
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:34,731
那个蓝眼睛的黑衣人
Yes, the men in black and the guy, the guy with the blue eyes.

334
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:35,836
蓝眼睛?
Blue eyes?

335
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,668
哦 绿眼睛 那个绿眼睛的人
Oh, green! Yes, green! The one green eye.

336
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:44,936
你还在撒谎 天生的谎言家 真让人讨厌
You just can't stop lying, can you cat? It's in the genes. This is gross.

337
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:49,286
我知道 这很讨厌 我也讨厌我自己
I know, it's disgusting, I disgust myself.

338
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:52,307
好莱坞?
Hollywood?

339
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:56,826
你放我下来 我就告诉你她在哪
But if you put me down, I'll show you where she is.

340
00:32:58,817 --> 00:33:00,717
松饼之家

341
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,972
瞧 你得明白 我这可是冒风险的
You know, I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

342
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:15,072
我邪恶身体的每一根骨头 都在告诉我
Every bone in my evil cat body is telling me...

343
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:17,938
不要背叛绿眼人
...not to betray the trust of the green-eyed man.

344
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:23,295
好了 这是全世界
Okay, this is a top, top secret map...

345
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:26,058
最最机密的地图!
...of the entire earth!

346
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:31,336
现在 我们是在这里 举着大火炬的绿女士旁边
Now, we're over here, by the green lady with the big torch.

347
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:34,351
而我的老板把Penny关在...
And my boss has Penny locked up...

348
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:40,858
就在...就在这里 这个戴太阳镜的饼干这里!
Right, right over... Here, here! By the waffle with the sun glasses!

349
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:44,069
你现在只需要从这里去到那里
Now all you need to do is get from here to there.

350
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:50,604
好了 我告诉你去哪找他 你放开我 我马上闪人
Well, I told you where you find her, so if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

351
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,381
找到Penny就放了你
I'll release you cat, when we found Penny.

352
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:57,321
什么 不是这样的 我们有约在先的
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal! We had a deal!

353
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,625
你的协议刚刚过期
Your deal just expired.

354
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,992
十分钟前 她也是这么跟我说的
She said that to me, not 10 minutes ago.

355
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:05,160
真讽刺!
The irony!

356
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:12,071
太好了
Perfect.

357
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:18,961
嗯 锁上了
Hmm... padlock.

358
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:26,695
听着 疯狗(Cujo电影名 又名凶狗古卓) 我的手掌下面藏着邪恶的利爪...
Listen Cujo, I got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts,...

359
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:30,921
别逼我把它们亮出来!
...do not, I beg of you do not make me bring out these bad boys!

360
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:32,841
会很吓人的!
It gets ugly!

361
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:36,938
- 你在干什么? - 待在后面!
- What are you doing? - Stay back!

362
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,076
要是我用力凝视这把锁 它就会着火然后熔化的
If I stare at the lock really hard, it'll burst into flames and melt.

363
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:44,123
现在我越来越担心了
Now I'm concerned on a number of levels.

364
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,610
- 轻点 看着路 - 我很好 还是往前走吧
- Easy, watch! Watch it those! - I'm good. We gotta go.

365
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:47,609
有人来了!
Intruders!

366
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:50,818
嘿 慢一点 你这疯狗...
Hey! Slow down you screwy borrowed of mind...

367
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:57,979
- 哦 哥们 这东西很重 - 嘿嘿 先放下来
- Oh, boy, this thing is heavy. - Hey, hey! Put it down.

368
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,838
我把钥匙拉下了
I forgot the keys.

369
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:02,951
我就回来
I'll be right back.

370
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:14,200
嘿 幸运硬币
Hey, lucky Penny.

371
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:17,012
谢了 起来干活儿吧
Thanks. Now move your butt.

372
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:21,699
好了 往左面抬 我抬不... 不 我能抬住
Okay, just upon your left. Yeah. I got... No, I got, I got mine.

373
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,743
好了么?
You got it?

374
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:33,433
话都快到嘴边了 我认识那狗
It's on tipping my tongue. I know that dog.

375
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:38,906
我跟你们说 乔伊 鲍比 我好像是... 我跟你们说
I'm telling you, Joey. Bobby, you guys looking at me like, you don't know. I'm telling you...

376
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,768
我认得这狗 我在哪见过他
...I know this dog. I've seen him somewhere.

377
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:44,525
你今晚就会想起来的 等你飞落后
You remember it tonight, when you're perching.

378
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:46,508
好的 是...这么回事
Allright, that's... That's will happen.

379
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:14,761
- 我有些好消息! - 真的么?
- I've got some good news! - Really?

380
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:19,704
是的 我刚安排你当 今晚节目的主要嘉宾!
Yes, I do. I just booked you, on the tonight show's "main guest"!

381
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:22,719
那很好 我是说...
That's right. That, I mean...

382
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:27,415
要是Bolt还没找到 这又有什么意思
...which means just absolutely nothing, if Bolt is still missing.

383
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:31,645
这连不算是个好消息 上今晚的节目 我才稀罕
It's not even a good news, like whatever, so up tonight show. Who cares? I don't care.

384
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:35,450
没事的 宝贝
It's okay, baby.

385
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:41,425
- 他一定很害怕 - 害怕? 他是Bolt啊
- He must be so scared. - Scared? This is Bolt we're talking about.

386
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,836
他从不害怕
He's not scared of anything.

387
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,347
我猜Bolt希望你上今晚的节目
I bet Bolt would want you to the tonight show.

388
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:48,704
这...
It is...

389
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:53,879
或许不是
I just... or maybe not.

390
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,655
Bolt非常爱你 你在这里
Bolt loves you very much sweety. And you're here.

391
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,969
他不会走远的
He couldn't have gone far.

392
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,699
欢迎来到俄亥俄州 期待您的发现!
Welcome to Ohio. So much to Discover!

393
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:15,097
要是你有超能力的话 我想这会让你...
So, if you got super powers, I guess that would make you, what...

394
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:18,402
成为超狗什么的? - 这是机密消息
...like some kind a super dog? - That information is classified.

395
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:21,291
哦 说说嘛 你最强的能力是什么?
Oh, come on! Like, what's your best power?

396
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,291
你移动快么 还有飞呢 你能飞么?
You go to move. How about flying? Can you fly?

397
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,254
别傻了 我不能飞
Don't be silly, I can't fly.

398
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:30,660
好吧 要是你没有任何能力的话...
Okay, okay, fine. If you don't have any powers,...

399
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:32,681
你有没有超能力 和我有什么相干?
...you don't have any powers. What's it to me?

400
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:38,703
- 我会狮子吼 - 超级狗叫吗? 喔 开什么玩笑?
- I have super bark. - A super bark? Wow, you're kidding me?

401
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,849
这个狮子吼到底有什么用?
What exactly this one do with the super bark?

402
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,067
我真的不能告诉你 那是机密
I really can't talk about it. It's classified.

403
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:50,976
我建议你别再问了 带我去见Penny
I suggest you pipe down and take me to Penny.

404
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:55,144
看来你和这个Penny 彼此分不开咯 小子?
You're awfully attached to this Penny character, huh wags?

405
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:59,011
- 她是我的主人 - 拜托 她只是个人而已
- She is my person. - Oh, please. She's a person.

406
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:04,033
如果你问我的话 唯一的好人是...
And if you ask me, the only good person is a...

407
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,406
泡沫塑料!
Styrofoam!

408
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,062
跟紧了!翻滚!
Tag and roll!

409
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,076
跟紧了 然后什么?
Tag and what?

410
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:34,815
这是? 我爪子里流出来的 红色液体是什么?
What? What is this red liquid coming from my paw?

411
00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:37,176
那是血 大英雄!
It's called blood, hero!

412
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,390
-我需要它么? -是的
- Do I need it? - Yes.

413
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:43,704
要是你不想让它流光的话...
So if you want it to keep inside your body where it belongs,...

414
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:47,709
...你就不该再从高速路 的飞车上纵身跳下!
...you should stop jumping off trucks doing eighty on the interstate!

415
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,989
是啊...通常我是刀枪不入的 一定是因为...
Yeah, well, normally I'm attain more indestructible. Must have been the...

416
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,856
泡沫塑料! 是那东西使我变弱的!
Styrofoam! That stuff, it weakens me!

417
00:38:57,262 --> 00:39:00,170
- 你在干吗?把它放下! - 好吧 我已经受够你了
- What are you doing? Put that down! - Allright, that's it. I've had with you.

418
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:05,450
小狗 为我松绑 不然... 我就会给你点颜色瞧瞧!
Untie me, pooch or I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Uhmm... I'm gonna seriously wound you!

419
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,097
我会用这个泡沫塑料来教训你!
I'm gonna seriously wound you with this styrofoam!

420
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,803
你疯了么?你难道不知道 泡沫塑料的威力么!
Are you mad? You don't know the power of styrofoam!

421
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:14,322
哦 你说对了 小宝贝 我现在要释放它了!

Poison? A parasite? Poison? Wait, I just said that, didn't I?

也就是哀求 装个可怜狗狗的表情!
You know, beg. Do the dog face!

All I'm asking you to do is just tilt your head a little.

447

左耳放下来 另外一只 好吧 那样更加好一点
Drop your left ear. Your other left. Okay, the other way was better.

She loves Bolt and he is awesome. And you're a monster!

嘿 我们能谈一谈么?
Hey, can we talk for a second?

527
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:22,473
我不懂这是咋回事 我只想知道...
I don't know what's going on here but I'm just a little bit concerned...

528
00:46:22,577 --> 00:46:24,884

We just the trajectory in the land dead center. Am I missing anything, Rhino?

The real world hurts, doesn't it? But you wouldn't know about that, would you?

563
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:52,213

Think about it Bolt. Since you got lost, none of your powers are working, aren't they?

572

你不行的 Bolt 你什么都不行

那些长得和你差不多的 Bolt

而像我们这种就老死在里面了

那个泡沫塑料真是个邪恶的东西

Totally awesome! There is no truck that I know that can keep Bolt and Rhino!

635
00:56:01,031 --> 00:56:04,272

- 你是闪电狗 - 但是我不是...
- You are Bolt. - But I'm not...

647
00:56:57,325 --> 00:57:00,746
是谁单枪匹马摧毁了 绿眼人的海底实验室?

...还有很多动物想做却做不到

就好像一个小仓鼠 他曾经在旅游车里生活
Like a little hamster, who once spend his days in a RV park.

他们需要的是一个英雄 闪电狗!

那是一个不畏艰难 勇往直前的英雄
Someone, who never mind what the odds, will do what's right.

660
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:56,676
你有一点说得很对 犀牛
Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino.

661

我想我应该挺身而出
I guess I'll have to do.

留下他们的猫自生自灭!
And leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself!

他们抛弃了她...
They leave her...

814
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:21,660

...wondering what she did wrong.

815
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:29,417
对不起Mittens 但是...

Yeah, but he... Uhm... He instructed me to tell you, that he... Uhm...

828
01:12:02,348 --> 01:12:05,189
他必须独自去面对绿眼人
He had to face the green-eyed man alone.

829
01:12:10,082 --> 01:12:12,201
- 你去哪? - 去找他

830
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,180
但他不再需要我们了
But he doesn't need us anymore.

831
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,833
相信我 我在电视里看过

832
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:23,575
在战斗开始前的黑夜里 当坏人的钢牙...
In the cold, dark night before the battle when the steely fangs of evil...

833
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:25,498

...are sharpened and points to strike...

834
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:29,543
...英雄必须独自去面对 他的最大的挑战
...the hero must go and face his greatest challenge alone.

835
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,864
但如果说闪电狗曾教会我什么的话...
But if Bolt's taught me anything,...

836
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:36,857
...那就是在他需要的时候 你绝不能丢下你的朋友!
...it's that you never abandon a friend in a time of need!

837
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:40,363
你的队友遇到困难 你就要挺身而出
When your team mates in trouble, you go.

838
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:43,074
不管他们是否向你求助 你都得去帮助他们!
Whether they ask or not, you go!

839
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,673
即使你不晓得 你是否还能活着回来...
Not knowing if you're coming back dead or alive...

840
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,679
他是朝另外一个方向去的
He went the other way.

841
01:12:47,891 --> 01:12:52,473
...你得去帮助他们!即使 这要穷尽你毕生之力 也得去!
...you go! Knowing your deepest ravel it's gonna appears your eye, you go!

842
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:17,874
Penny!
Penny!

843
01:13:20,184 --> 01:13:24,479

No way! Wow! Bolt! I'm really a big fan of yours, brother.

844
01:13:24,516 --> 01:13:27,119

Oh, no!

847
01:13:29,424 --> 01:13:31,264
这是我们的私人助理 比利...
And this is our personal assistant, Billy...

848
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,341
...他应该现在在电线上停着的
...who is supposed to wait up on the wire.

849
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:36,064
闪电狗 我已经仰慕你好久啦 有几句话我一直好想和你说...
Bolt, I've been admired you such a long time and there is something I always wanted...

850
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:37,927
...如果我有机会遇到你的话 现在我...
...to tell you if I ever get a chance to meet you. Now I...

851
01:13:37,964 --> 01:13:39,716
好了 比利 你吓到人家了
Okay Billy, that was horrifying what you just did.

852
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:42,812
想要做些好事么?去拿些面包屑给我 要全谷物的 去吧!
Wanna make something useful? Go get me some bread crumbs. Whole grain. Go!

853
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:45,034
全谷物的 不是全麦的 比利!
Whole-wheat is not the same thing as whole grain, Billy!

854
01:13:45,098 --> 01:13:46,760
- 不一样的 比利! - 不要拿全麦的回来!
- Not the same, Billy! - Do not come out with whole-wheat!

855
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,249
也不要黑面包 比利
Or pumpernickle Billy!

856
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,941
- 好吧 朋友们 我得走了 - 我知道 你一直很忙
- Okay guys, but I really gotta get going. - I know. I know you're a busy dog.

857
01:13:51,972 --> 01:13:54,583
但你能不能抽几分钟听一下 我们对你节目的精彩策划...
But if you got a second for a lovely picture idea for your show,...

858
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:56,932
...汤姆比我会讲 由他来向你解释
...Tom has better pitching. I'll let him taking from here.

859
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,461
让我们把话筒交给汤姆
Tom has got the spotlight.

860
01:14:01,764 --> 01:14:03,370
让我们拭目以待!
Wait for it!

861
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,338
- 外星人 - 很简单吧!
- Aliens. - Holy snap!

862
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:10,702
- 外星人? - 观众们喜欢外星人
- Aliens? - Audiences love aliens.

863
01:14:10,703 --> 01:14:11,433
啊哈!
Holy crap!

864
01:14:11,476 --> 01:14:14,268
- 他们应该是巨人 巨大的人! - 你碰不到我们的!
- It will be huge man! Huge! - You can't touch us!

865
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:20,947
挺好啊 其实我想问问你们 是否可以帮我找到Penny...
I love it. I'll tell you what, if you guys can help me find Penny,...

866
01:14:20,948 --> 01:14:23,006
...就是那个电视里的女孩...
...the girl from the television show...

867
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:27,273
...我想进一步听听这个关于 外星人的点子 但是边走边说!
...I'd love hear more about this aliens idea, but on the way.

868
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,789
- 我们有希望啦! - 别激动!
- We got a nibble! - Don't freak out.

869
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:31,625
你这么搞砸"海底总动员"的
This is how you blew with Nemo.

870
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,821
我们以外太空的场景开始
We open exterior outer space scenery.

871
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:38,089
卡利科来抓Penny了
Calico comes for your Penny.

872
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:40,586
然后你就去揍扁他!
And then you squish him.

873
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,817
然后传输光束把你和Penny 带去外星人的母舰...
And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny and you to aliens' mother ship...

874
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,306
...画面渐暗
...we fade to black.

875
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:57,853
接着我们为片尾加上 首绝妙的流行歌
And we have a great pop song for the end credits.

876
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,845
和你的人谈一谈吧 我们策划的差不多了
Talk your people. We're ready to move on this.

877
01:15:00,151 --> 01:15:01,711
看来有戏哦!
He is so on board!

878
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:11,991
就是这里啦!
There it is!

879
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:19,107
世界上最最恐怖的地方!
The most terrifying place on earth!

880
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:33,101
闪电狗 周四 晚八点

881
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:43,711
终于我们到达了虎穴
At long last, we've arrived at he belly of the beast.

882
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,444
这是绿眼人的老窝!
The lair of the green-eyed man!

883
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,756
犀牛 等等!
Rhino, hold up!

884
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:52,725
等等!
Hold up!

885
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,398
怎么 怎么啦? 我...难道我看上去不够帅?
What, what is the problem? I'm... I'm popped?

886
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:01,209
你听着 也许这对你来说 有点不可思议...
Listen, this may be really hard for you to understand...

887
01:16:01,246 --> 01:16:04,252
...但 有时事情的真相很复杂...
...but you see, sometimes things aren't what they seem to be...

888
01:16:04,288 --> 01:16:08,444
...有时你认为它是真的 但事实上却不是...
...and sometimes when you think something is really real and it's not,...

889
01:16:08,657 --> 01:16:12,483
我等这一刻已经很久了
All of my training has prepared me for this moment.

890
01:16:13,286 --> 01:16:15,390
去死吧!去死吧!
Die! Die!

Prepare yourself, follow man beast! I will eat your pancreas...

892
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:25,963

...with your spleen and then I will rip your liver out of your...

893

你长着小胡子 真可爱啊!
You're so cute with your little whiskers.

894

哦 在我很小的时候 我养了 一只和你一模一样的仓鼠
<i>Oh, I had a hamster just like you when I was a kid.</i>

895

我是决不会这么做的
You know I'll never do such a thing.

912
01:19:21,693 --> 01:19:27,927
这可事关你女儿的生死哦!
Unless it was only way to save your little girl's life!

922
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:17,781
说来话长 简单讲 我和 一只疯狗一起走遍全国...
Long story, short I was tied to a delusional dog and dragged across the country...

923
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:22,049
...但是那些都不重要 重要的是...
...but that is not important now. The real question is,...

924
01:20:22,653 --> 01:20:26,016
...你在这里干吗? 你怎么不在里面?
...what are you doing here and why aren't you in there?

925

不 Bolt 那是真的
No Bolt, it is real.

928
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:41,023
刚刚我在里面 看到她的表情
I was in there just now, I saw her face after you left.

929
01:20:41,268 --> 01:20:43,149
她心都碎了
She's broken hearted.

930
01:20:44,551 --> 01:20:47,455
她不要其他狗 她只喜欢你
She doesn't want just any dog, she loves you.

931

- Bolt 你必须相信我 - Mittens 安静点!

946
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:39,215
Bolt!

947
01:22:53,559 --> 01:22:54,965
我知道你会回来的
I knew you'll come back.

948
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,090

967
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:21,870
对于发生的一切 我真的感到好难过
I'm so, so, so sorry does happened.

968

我难以想象你现在的感觉

No, no, wait! Let's not make any rush decisions.

975
01:26:50,779 --> 01:26:51,888
我们再可以商量商量
Let's put a pin on it.

976
01:27:03,839 --> 01:27:06,951
你受的伤...
I'm afraid your injuries far more severe...

977
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:09,062
...比我们预想的要严重 亲爱的
...then we've previously thought, my dear.

978
01:27:09,564 --> 01:27:13,180
我们必须彻底给你整容
We have to completely reconstruct your face.

979
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:16,841
你看看
Have a look.

980
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:24,652
至少卡利科不会再认出我了
At least Calico won't be able to recognize me.

981
01:27:28,728 --> 01:27:30,200
卡利科!
Calico!

982
01:27:42,386 --> 01:27:43,650
Bolt!


983
01:27:52,806 --> 01:27:53,849
什么?
What?

984
01:28:04,682 --> 01:28:06,247
外星人!
Aliens!

985
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:13,285
这真是太离谱了
That is totally unrealistic.

986
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:17,446
- 百分百"欢谬" - 你说的没错
- Absolutely "redonkulous". - You could say that again.

987
01:28:17,538 --> 01:28:20,454
对!就在那! 再过去一点!
Oh! Oh, yeah! Right there! Right there! Over!

988
01:28:21,018 --> 01:28:23,822
是啊 就是这里
Yeah, that's the spot.

989
01:28:33,306 --> 01:28:34,611
嘿 小笨狗!
Hey, silly doggy!

990
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:42,043
留个纪念!
That's a keeper.

991
01:28:42,545 --> 01:28:46,010
你想要出去玩吗? 你想要出去玩么?
You wanna go play outside, huh? You wanna go play outside?

992
01:28:46,764 --> 01:28:47,868
我们走吧!
Let's go!

993
01:29:00,925 --> 01:29:07,160
- 那狗是不是看上去很眼熟? - 不是 我之前从没见过他
- Is that dog look familiar? - Nope. I've never seen him before in my life.

994
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:22,133
# 你的家是如此独一无二
<i># There is no home like the one you've got,</i>

995
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:29,626
# 因为这个家属于你
<i># cuz that home belongs to you.</i>
