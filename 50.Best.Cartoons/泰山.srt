- 我不是故意的 - 他还是个孩子

231
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,270
孩子也不行 不要老护着他
That's no excuse, kala ! You can't keep defending him !

永远不会跟我们一样
You can't learn to be one of us.

235
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600

他可能有一点大象的血统
That maybe tarzan could be some subspecies of elephant.

319

333
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,330
这让我想起在尚比加打猎那次的经验 喔...
This reminds me of the safari l led up the Zambezi.

334
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,340
太精彩啦 什么都有啊
Back, back, back, back, back.

335
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,350
到处是野蜜蜂
Ooh, was it scary there.

336
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,340
有两个人帮我装三把枪的子弹 我就这样轰他们
Two men with only three rifles. We blasted away.

337

我终于知道自己天生就是...非洲的大克星
That,s when l knew l was born for africa!

338

非洲就是我...

342
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,380
我好像是看到什么东西啦
I thought I saw something.

343
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,380
是不是大河马 食人鱼还是犀牛啊
Is it a hippopotamus amphibious, or a rhinoceros bihornus ?

344
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,380
- 教授 不要动 好... - 好

345

348
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,400
克里顿先生叫我不要动 他看到个东西
Mr. Clayton asked me not to move. He saw something.

349
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,400

我跟我爸爸到这里来
But my father and I came on this expedition

352
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,330
是想研究猩猩...
To study gorillas.

353
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,400
我觉得你这样子冒然开枪会吓到他们
I believe your shooting might be scaring them off.

354
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,340
布小姐 你雇我是为了保护你们
You hired me to protect you, miss porter,

355
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,340
我这么做也是为了保护你们
And protect you I shall.

356
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,420
我们也觉得你做的非常好
And you're doing a marvelous job of it.

357
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,410

Jane ! Jane, do you realize what you're standing in ?

359
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,430
- 猩猩的窝呀! - 喔! 爸爸
- A gorilla's nest ! - Oh, daddy !

360
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,420
好不容易啊 这么多天啦
At last, our first sign in days !

361
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,430
- 那些野兽会在附近吗? - 很可能啊!
- Do you think the beasts could be nearby ? - Could be.

362
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,430
你看这就是证据啦 他们可能离我们很近啊...
There,s the evidence. Not very far, anyway.

363
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,440
爸 你看 那一边 还有那边...那里? 看到啦
Daddy, look ! Over there and there !

364
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,440
唉! 有更多的窝...我看到他们...
Where ? Oh,yes, more nests! I see them !

365
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,870
- 跟您想的一样 - 是一个大家族吁
- Just as you predicted. - Whole family groups !

366
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,430
喔! 珍妮 我爱你
Jane, I love you !

367
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,580
一个大家族? 拜托! 两位
Family groups ? Excuse me,

368
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,690
那些可能都是野兽
But these are wild beasts...

369
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,420
而且那些野兽会要了你们的命耶
That would sooner tear your head off than look at you.

370
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,450
正好相反 我爸的意思是他们不是可怕的
On the contrary.daddy's theory is that these are social creatures...

371
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,390
克里顿先生 拜托
Mr. Clayton, please !

372
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,390
万一伤了猩猩...
What if it's a gorilla ?

373
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,360
那不是猩猩
It's no gorilla.

374
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
嗯 我看我们再继续走走...
Hmm. But perhaps we should press on.

375
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,370
好的 再走走...
Yes, indeed.

376
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
我想 我们应该往西走
We should keep heading west

377
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,410
跟着这些窝走下去
Following the ganoderma ablonatum.

378
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,370
唉! 太好了 教授
Excellent, professor!

379
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,520

You may not be a gorilla,

385
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,500

要不然你父母还以为我真的欺负你了
What would your parents have to say ?

你看 你父母真的发火了吧
Oh ! See, I told you they'd be cross.

Can't we walk ?

460
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,920
- 泰山 - 你在哪里? 嘿...泰山

461
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,920
希望我们比哥查先找到泰山
Let's hope we find him before kerchak does.

462
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,810
他可能走丢了
Maybe he's lost.

463
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,920
或是找到更好玩的东西了
Or found something more interesting.

464

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,940
- 泰山 - 泰山 - 泰山

珍妮 喔! 珍妮 谢天谢地
Jane ! Oh,jane ! Oh, thank goodness.

502
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,110
天啊! 这里是怎么啦
Good heavens, what happened ?

503
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,110
你还好吗? 我们到处在找你 我吓坏了
Are you all right ? We've been everywhere looking for you. I-

504
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,100
- 我的天啊 爸 我在散步 然后... - 怎么啦?
- Oh, my goodness ! Daddy ! I was out walking. I was- Yes, yes.

505
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,120
- 小宝宝...小猴子宝宝 我画了画... - 嗯 后来呢?
- Little baby monkey. I drew a picture. - Yes, go on.

506
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,120
- 突然 猴子哭了 - 噢 可怜的东西
- Suddenly the monkey starts crying. - Oh, poor thing.

507
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,120
我回头一看
I turned 'round and there's

508
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,120
- 一大群全部都跑出来了 - 什么? 什么呀
- A whole fleet of them ! - Of what ?

509
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,120
一大群的大猴子呀 整颗树都是他们呢
There's an army of monkeys. A huge tree full of them.

510
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,120
- 谁? - 猴子
- Monkeys ? Monkeys !

511
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,560
对着我叫
Screaming at me ! Ooo-ooo-ooo !

512
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,130
她学的是一种狒狒
That's theripithicus baboonus.

513
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,170
- 她学的最像了 - 哦 是吗?
- She's very good at this. - Oh, really ?

514
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,130
好可怕 把我吓坏了
Terrified I was.

515
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,170
突然我在树上荡过来荡过去
And suddenly, I was swinging in the vines.

516
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,140
跟那些狒狒?
With the monkeys, yes ?

517
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,170
荡呀 飞呀 在半空中
Swinging, flying. I was in the air.

518
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,140
半空中? 然后呢?
In the air, yes, I know.

519
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,180
- 然后他们围着我 - 那你怎么办
- And i'm all surrounded. - What did you do ?

520
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,140
我...爸爸...他们拿走了我的靴子
Daddy, they took my boot.

521
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,180
拿走了 那是我买的
They took... Those are the ones I bought you.

522
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,150
我就被救啦
And I was saved !

523
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,180
我是被一个腰上围块布的野人救下来
I was saved by a flying wild man in a loincloth.

524
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,150
腰上围块布
Loincloth ? Good lord.

525
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,150
她在说些什么啊
What is she talking about ?

526
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,690
我...我也给她搞糊涂啦
I haven't the foggiest idea.

527
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,460
她是遗传她妈妈
Takes after her mother, you know.

528
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,160
就爱说故事
She'd come up with stories like that.

529
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,180
不过她妈妈可没说过什么腰里缠块布的野人
Not about men in loincloths, of course.

530
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,160
- 喔 后来好多猩猩 - 猩猩?
- And there were gorillas. - Gorillas ? They were doing...

531
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,170
你看到猩猩啦? 在哪?
You saw the gorillas ? Where,jane, where ?

532
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,170
跟着他走啦
He left with them.

533
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,170
跟谁? 谁啊
Who, dear, who ?

534
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,170
泰山
Tarzan.

535
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,160
- 泰山 - 那个人猿
- Tarzan ? - The ape man.

536
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,180
注意! 尽量避免接近陌生人
Everyone, we will avoid the strangers.

537
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,220
不要跟他们正面接触
Do not let them see you,

538
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,180
不要去惹他们
And do not seek them out.

539
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,220
他们不会伤害我们的 哥查
They mean us no harm, kerchak.

540
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,190
泰山 我们不认识他们
Tarzan, I don't know that.

541
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,190
我认识 我已经见过他们了
But I do. I've spent time with them.

542
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,190
你会给家族带来危险 我不允许
You may be willing to risk our safety, but i'm not.

543
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,190
为什么你要那么害怕跟你长得不一样的动物
Why are you threatened by anyone different from you ?

544
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,190
为了保护我的家族 给我离他们远一点
Protect this family, and stay away from them.

545
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,210
泰山 就这一次 听哥查的
Tarzan, for once listen to kerchak.

546
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,200
为什么你不告诉我有动物跟我长的一样
Why didn't you tell me there were creatures that looked like me ?

547
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,260
他呀! 不像我们这样站着
Well, he didn't stand upright,

548
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,220
弯着腰 像这样
He sort of crouched, like that.

549
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,260
- 真的? - 他总是用脚尖来撑着身体
- Really ? - Supported his weight on his knuckles.

550
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,230
- 哦 用脚尖撑着 - 明白不?
- On the knuckles ! - See ?

551
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,230
没错! 就像只大猩猩 太奇妙了
Exactly like a gorilla ! - Extraordinary !

552
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,230
喔 还有更奇怪的
Ah, it was amazing !

553
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,270
他两只脚往外撇
And he bends his elbows out like this,

554
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,230
走路 就像这样
Nd then he walks like this.

555
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,240
喔 我知道啦 像你四姑
Oh, I see ! Like aunt isabel !

556
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,240
哈哈哈 真是太奇妙啦
Bup-bup-bup, oh-oh * this is capital ! - Mmm.

557
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,240
喔 珍妮 珍妮 这是一个大发现
Oh,janey,jane ! What a discovery !

558
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,250
一个不会人类的语言行为的野...
A man with no language, no human behavior.

559
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,250
而且他还不懂人际的界限呢
And no respect for personal boundaries.

560
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,290
- 怎么说呢? - 他靠我这么近G 爸 喔...
- How do you mean ? - He was this close, daddy !

561
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,250
两个眼睛瞪着我
Staring at me.

562
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,250
先是...很奇怪
He seemed confused at first,

563
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:05,260
好像从来没有见过人一样
As if he's never seen another human before.

564
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,260
他的眼睛好热情
His eyes were intense,

565
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,260
好专注 好...
And focused and...

566
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,260
我从来没有见过这样子的眼睛
I've never seen such eyes.

567
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,270
喔 我是不是该让你
Oh, shall i, ahem,

568
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,260
跟那块黑板谈情说爱
Leave you and the blackboard alone for a moment ?

569
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,280
爸爸 别这样
Daddy, stop it.

570
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,280
最重要的是我们可以
The point is,

571
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,310
从他那学到很多
Think of what we could learn from him.

572
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,280
我们一定要找到他
We must find him.

573
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,280
教授 您到这来是找猩猩的
Professor, you are here to find gorillas,

574
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,290
可不是来谈情说爱的
Not indulge some girlish fantasy.

575
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,280
你说什么 又不是我编的 泰山是...
Fantasy ? I didn't imagine him ! Tarzan is...

576
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,300
是真的
Real.

577
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,300
喔! 是他 是他
Ah ! It's him !

578
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,300
他...就是泰山
It's, it's, it's him. Tarzan !

579
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,300
- 教授 珍妮 退后 - 等一等
- Professor ! Jane ! Stand back ! - Wait !

580
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,300
不...
No !

581
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,310
克里顿
Clayton.

582
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,310
啊?
Huh ?

583
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,310
克里顿
Clayton.

584
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,310
我们认识吗?
Have we... Met ?

585
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,320
他怎么会知道我的名字
How does he know my name ?

586
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,320
他以为那是枪响的说法
He thinks it means the sound of a gunshot.

587
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:08,310
- 珍妮 - 对了 你好 泰山
- Jane. - Yes, hello, mmm, tarzan.

588
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,320
你知道你说的人际界限是什么了
I see what you mean about those personal boundaries.

589
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,330
嗯...他在做什么
What's he doing ?

590
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,330
珍妮 你看看他 哈哈
Look at him,Jane.

591
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,330
真像只猩猩 又像是人
Moves like an ape but looks like a man.

592
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,340
会是进化论的好对象
He could be the missing link !

593
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,340
也是找猩猩的好线索
Or our link to the gorillas.

594
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,340
哦...当然啦 是是是 当然啦...
Ahh, yes, yes.

595
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:30,330
那些猩猩在哪里
Where are the gorillas ?

596
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,350
大猩猩
Go-ril-las !

597
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,350
大猩猩
Go-ril-las !

598
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,890
对他叫没有用
Shouting won't help, mr. Clayton.

599
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,640
他不知道你在说什么
He doesn't understand english.

600
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,360
喔! 那我画给他看嘛
Then i'll make him understand.

601
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,360
我告诉你 我教的鹦鹉能够唱国歌
If I can teach a parrot to sing god save the queen,

602
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,350
我当然也能教他点东西
I can certainly teach this savage a thing or two.

603
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,370
大猩猩
Go-rilla.

604
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,370
- 大猩猩! - 哈哈 他知道了

彷佛看到其中奥妙
I can see there's so much to learn

623
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,450
从他眼中
Every gesture

624
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,440
流露出无限爱 爱神的箭 射中了我
Every move that she makes makes me feel like never before

625
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,460
我心在跳

直到我深深了解这世界
There's a world l need to know

641
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,540
浪费了这么多的时间他学会了没有
We've wasted all this time on what he wants.

642
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,540
船这几天就要到了,直接问他行不行呢
The boat could arrive any day. Now ask him straight out.

643
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,550

661
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,630
等一等呀 等一等 我等了三十多年
Wait, please. Don't... I've waited 30 years for this,

662
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,630
就想见识一下猩猩的世界 没看到我不走...
And I won't leave until I see a gorilla.

663
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,630
喔...真可惜呀 喔...

就说引擎有毛病
Just tell them you've had engine trouble

多留个几天再走也不迟
And give us two more days.

668

一班拖 班班都拖 这是要去伦敦呀
And be late at every port from here to london ?

669
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,650
那我们这趟就白来了耶
We'll have come all this way for nothing.

670

抱歉! 布小姐 恕难从命

早就把那些野兽给找出来了

唉! 你以为没见到它们我不失望吗

泰山 我好担心见不到你

686
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:20,730

698
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,730
女人的感情是变的很快的
There are no trails through a woman's heart.

699

托托 把哥查带开一下就好了
Terk, all you have to do is get kerchak out of the way.

嘿! 闭上你的象嘴带我离开
Shut your trunk and get me outta here.

715
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,790
他这算是什么朋友嘛
Can you believe that guy ?

716
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,780
丢下我们连头都不回就走了
Drops us like a newborn giraffe... Kerplop !

717
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,800
他简直就不是他了嘛 怎么会说变就变了呢! 搞什么
Now waltzes in here and expects us to just...

718
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,800
托托 算我求你好吗
Terk, i'm asking you as a friend.

719
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,800
喔...喔

噢...好啦
Aah ! All right !

722
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,810
可是你不能让我出丑总可以吧
But don't make me do anything embarrassing.

723
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,810
我一定要找他算帐
I'm gonna kill him !

724
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:22,810
我还觉得这件衣服让你看起来瘦了很多
A- Actually, I thought that dress was rather slimming on you.

725
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,820
是吗? 我觉得有点太暴露了耶
Oh, really ? I thought it was a little revealing and kind of-

726
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,810
小心啊

01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,240
反正每天都有人在森林里失踪嘛
After all, people get lost in the jungle every day. Right ?

908
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:26,250
哦 我走了...
Tootle-pip !

909
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:48,270
对自己的梦想要有信心
Put your faith in what you most believe in

910
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:52,270
一个新的世界
Two worlds One family

911
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,280
心相信 呼啸而行
Trust your heart let fate decide

912
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,280
生命带领无限宽广延续
To guide these lives to guide these lives we see

913
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:04,290
对自己的梦想要有信心
Put your faith in what you most believe in

914
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:09,290
一个新的世界
Two worlds One family

915
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:29,310
当你的心中感觉到伤悲
Come, stop your crying and we'll be all right

916
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:34,320
找人倾诉和安慰
Just take my hand hold it tight

917
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,320
可以呼唤我到你的身边
I will protect you from all around you

918
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:44,330
让我陪你流着泪
I will be here don't you cry

919
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:48,330
生命渺小 却很奇妙
For one so small you seem so strong

920
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,330
我们有爱面对整个世界
My arms will hold you keep you safe and warm

921
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:58,340
谁都挡不了 爱的蔓延
This bond between us can't be broken

922
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:03,340
让我陪你不流泪
I will be here don't you cry

923
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:08,350
你在我心里面
'Cause you'll be in my heart

924
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,350
你在我心里面
Yes,you'll be in my heart

925
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,360
就从今天 超越心中永远
From this day on now and forevermore

926
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:28,370
在我心里面
You'll be in my heart

927
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:33,370
管他世事变迁
No matter what they say

928
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:38,380
你在我心里面
You'll be here in my heart

929
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:43,380
不变
Always

930
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:50,390
若我们的爱他们不了解
Why can't they understand the way we feel

931
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,400
就让时间来解释这一切
They just don't trust what they can't explain

932
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,400
表面上虽然和他们不同
Well, l know we're different but deep inside us

933
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:05,410
爱却是相同的语言
We're not that different at all

934
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:10,410
你在我心里面
And you'll be in my heart

935
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:15,420
你在我心里面
Yes,you'll be in my heart

936
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:20,420
就从今天 超越心中永远
From this day on now and forevermore

937
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:30,430
别用他们眼光 丈量我诺言
Don't listen to them 'cause what do they know

938
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,440
让爱来证明一遍一遍
We need each other to have, to hold

939
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,440
总有一天
They'll see in time

940
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:44,450
看见
I know

941
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:49,450
别拿世俗的心 分析感觉
When destiny calls you you must be strong

942
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:54,460
让爱来回答一遍一遍一遍
I may not be with you but you've got to hold on

943
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,460
总有一天
They'll see in time

944
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:03,480
看见

945
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:05,480

你在我心里面
'Cause you'll be in my heart

947
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:14,480
因为你在我心里面
Believe me you'll be in my heart

948
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,480
就从今天
I'll be there from this day on

949
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,480
超越心中永远
Now and forevermore

950
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:29,490
哦! 你在我心里面
Oh,you'll be in my heart

951
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:34,500
管他世事多变迁
No matter what they say l'll be with you

952
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,500
你在我心里面
You'll be here in my heart

953
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:43,500
我爱你不变
I'll be there always

954
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:49,510
不变
Always

955
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,520
我会爱你
I'll be with you

956
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,520
不管他世事多变迁
Well, l'll be there for you always

957
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:03,520
在我心里面
Always and always

958
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:08,530
无论在什么时间
Just look over your shoulder

959
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:13,530
无论在什么地点
Just look over your shoulder

960
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:18,540
无论有什么改变
Just look over your shoulder

961
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:22,540
我在你身边
I'll be there always

962
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,560
对自己的梦想要有信心
Put your faith in what you most believe in

963
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,560
虽然两个世界
Two worlds One family

964
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:44,570
心相信 呼啸而行
Trust your heart let fate decide

965
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:48,570
生命一览无遗
To guide these lives we see

966
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:53,570
在这个天堂的领域
A paradise untouched by man

967
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:58,580
是经过爱的洗礼
Within this world blessed with love

968
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:03,580
简单自然 如此和平
A simple life they live in peace

969
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:06,600
眼光看远 别孩子气
Raise your head up, lift high the load

970
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:10,590
为爱去顶天立地
Take strength from those that need you

971
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,600
坚强自己 全心全意
Build high the walls, build strong the beams

972
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,610
阻挡所有
A new life is waiting

973
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,600
可能会来临的坏事情
But danger's no stranger here

974
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:37,620
母亲的泪向谁说明
No words describe a mother's tears

975
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:41,620
伤过的心谁能抚平
No words can heal a broken heart

976
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:46,630
别看过去 只要倾听
A dream is gone but where there's hope

977
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,630
希望在远方呼唤着你
Somewhere something is calling for you

978
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:54,640
一个新的家庭
Two worlds One family

979
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,640
心相信 呼啸而行
Trust your heart, let fate decide

980

生命一览无遗
To guide these lives we see
