片名:北极特快

3
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,290
多年以前的某个圣诞夜
On Christmas Eve, many years ago...

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,920
我静静的躺在床上
...I lay quietly in my bed.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,420
我没有翻来覆去
I did not rustle the sheets.

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,880
也没有心浮气燥
I breathed slowly and silently.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,760
我仔细听着 害怕再也听不到...
I was listening for a sound I was afraid I'd never hear.

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,230
圣诞老人雪橇上的铃声
The ringing bells of Santa 's sleigh.

9
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,860
好了 好了 你喝完了水 是吗
All right. All right, Sarah, you had your water.

10
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,070
该上楼睡觉啦
Now let's get you upstairs and into bed.

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,870
但...但...我得...
But...But...But, I hace to...

12
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,330
他说圣诞老人得飞的比光速还快...
He said Santa would have to fly faster than light...

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,330
才能在一个晚上到每户人家去 他的雪橇也得和一艘货船一样大
...to get to every house in one night. And to hold everyone's presents...

14
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,210
才能装的下每个人的礼物
...his sled would be bigger than an ocean liner.

15
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,380
你哥哥是这么说的? 他是说笑 他知道圣诞老人是怎样的
Your brother said that? He was just kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

16
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,220
他说他不确定 是不是真的有圣诞老人
He said he wasn't sure. He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

17
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,430
当然有啦 就像圣诞节也是真的呀
Of course Santa is real. He's as real as Christmas itself.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,230
但是如果不好好睡觉 圣诞老人就不会来
But he won't come until you're sound asleep, young lady.

19
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,060
祝好梦
Sweet dreams.

20
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,230
圣诞老人很快就会来
Santa will be here before you know it.

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
快睡吧
So go to sleep.

22
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,280
史塔克 拜伦
Stark, barren.

23
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,990
无生命迹象
Decoid of life.

24
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,260
大概已经睡着了
He's gotta be asleep by now.

25
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,470
他以前总是不睡 要等圣诞老人
He used to stay awake all night waiting for Santa.

26
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,220
以前的日子都过去了
Think those days are just about over.

27
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,310
如果真是这样 那也真伤心
That would be sad if that were true.

28
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,980
对呀 童真不再
Yeah, an end of the magic.

29
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,730
圣诞快乐 甜心
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

30
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,950
他睡的真熟
See, he's out like a light.

31
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,290
就算火车来也吵不醒
An express train wouldn't wake him up now.

32
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,000
童真不再
"End of the magic"?

33
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,390
上车咯
All aboard!

34
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,560
上车咯
All aboard!

35
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,930
你...要上车吗
Well, You coming?

36
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,430
去哪儿
Where?

37
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,760
当然是去北极啦
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

38
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,770
这是极地特快
This is the Polar Express.

39
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,440
北极
The North Pole?

40
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,560
我明白了
I see.

41
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,110
请替我拿一下
Hold this, please.

42
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,240
谢谢
Thank you.

43
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,860
这是你吗
Is this you?

44
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,490
- 是的 - 这上说...
-Yeah. -Well, it says here...

45
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,330
今年没去商场和圣诞老人拍照 也没写信给他
...no photo with a department-store Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

46
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,170
还叫你妹妹也不要写...
And you made your sister put out the milk and cookies.

47
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,000
看来今年是你的关键年
Sounds to me like this is your crucial year.

48
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,550
如果我是你 就会立刻上车
If I were you, I would think about climbing onboard.

49
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,810
快 快 快 我赶时间...哇

随你吧
Suit yourself.

51
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,880
在极地特快上 事情就是这样子的
'Cause that's the way things happen On the Polar Express

52
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,050
呜~呜~汽笛响 是她唱歌的声音
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows That's the sound of her singing

53
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,470

希望永远不要结束
Wish it would 't ever have to end

61
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,740
加上一点运气 我们会准时到的 没有必要有压力
With a little luck, we'll be on time There's no need to stress

62
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,410

'Cause that's the way things happen On the Polar Express

63

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,130
难道只有我懂
Am I the only one who understands that?

303
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,090
我早该猜到
You. I should hace known.

304
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,130
你是不是一心 想让车子到不了北极
Are you bound and determined that this train never reaches the North Pole?

305
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,890
看
But look.

306
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,720
驯鹿过街
Caribou crossing?!

307
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,390
我猜最少十万 或许百万
I make that herd to be at least 1 00,000, maybe even a million.

308
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,650
要它们全部让路得要几个小时
It's gonna be hours before they clear this track.

309
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,860
- 麻烦的事情 - 我们这下麻烦大了
-A tough nut to crack. -We are in some serious jelly.

310
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,490
- 非常拥挤 - 紧要关头
-And a jam. -Tight spot.

311
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,990
- 小溪上去 - 树上去
-Up a creek. -Up a tree.

312
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,370
- 在草地里迷失 - 我告诉你什么草地 我们...
-Lost in the grass. -I'll tell you what's grass: our a...

313
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,210
问题解决了 慢...速...前进
Problem solced. All ahead, slow.

314
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,000
我们驶的很快耶
We're going pretty fast.

315
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,050
去告诉机师们放慢速度
Tell the engineer to slow down.

316
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,010
慢一点
Slow it down.

317
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,640
小心速度太快
Watch the speed!

318
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,730
跳开了 快把它抓住
Jumping jeepers, the cotter pin sheared off.

319
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,190
- 什么东西? - 栓子
-What? -The pin.

320
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,530
- 哪里? - 那里
-Where? -There.

321
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,240
- 不妙! - 不妙
-Oh, no. -Oh, no.

322
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,200
- 他们听不到我 - 听不到
-They can't hear me. -They can't?

323
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,040
不喜欢这个景象 在安全栏下面
I don't like the look of this. Under the safety bar.

324
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,500
不会有事儿吧? 我们该怎么办
Is everything all right? What should we do?

325
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,850
照...目前的状况来看 我们无法连络机师...
Considering we've lost communication with the engineer...

326
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,220
我们在车头前 完全暴露在外
...we are standing totally exposed on the front of the locomotive...

327
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,560
车一直在加速 无法控制
...the train appears to be accelerating uncontrollably...

328
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,560
我们快速冲向前方的冰峡谷
...and we are rapidly approaching Glacier Gulch...

329
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,230
这是世上最陡峭的峡谷
...which happens to be the steepest downhill grade in the world...

330
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,690
我建议我们都得...
...I suggest we all hold on...

331
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,490
抓～紧～栏～
...tightly.

332
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,510
- 栓子 - 栓子
-The pin. -The pin.

333
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,910
糟糕...车轨已经被冰覆盖
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen over the tracks.

334
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,470
不...不...抓紧...抓紧
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

335
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,520
快!小心脚下...快...
Come on. Watch your step.

336
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,900
抓紧...快上来...快
Come on, sweetie. Up you go. Up you go.

337
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,820
脚放在这里 这里
Put your feet on here. On here.

338
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,660
有点刺激 是吗
Little adcenture, huh?

339
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,240
小伙子...反应满快的
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

340
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,100
到左边去
Step to your left, please. To your left.

341
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,440
呵...这才像话
Well, that is more like it.

342
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,530
你们搞啥
What in the name of Mike?

343
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,120
看
Look.

344
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,500
快带我们火速离开
Get us the blazes out of here!

345
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,340
让车滑开
Turn this sled around.

346
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,230
看那里
Look there.

347
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,280
车轨

348
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,860

拉手
Port astern.

355
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,860
放慢
To the starboard.

356
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,740
- 我的拖鞋 - 你的车票要掉了
-My slipper. -You're gonna lose your ticket.

357
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,780
不是我的 是你的
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

358
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,790
- 我的? - 对
-It's my ticket? -Yes.

谢谢你 真不敢相信 你帮我找到车票
Thank you. I can't believe you found my ticket.

370
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,000

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,480
-"L-E"? - 和那个万事通的一样
-"L-E"? -Just like that know-it-all kid.

374
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,080
走路小心
Watch your step. Tricky walking up here.

375
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,630
提醒你 上坡时 路很滑
It's mighty slick. Mighty slick, I tell you.

376
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,340
我刚说啥来着
There you go. What did I tell you?

377
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,640
很久以前 我首次圣诞夜之旅 我在车顶巡视...
Years ago, on my first Christmas Ece run, I was up on the roof making my rounds...

378
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
也踩到冰滑了一下
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

379
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,310
我伸手去抓栏杆 但栏杆断了 就滑倒了
I reached out for a hand iron, but it broke off. I slid and fell.

380
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:48,480
但是没有掉下车去
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

381
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,310
某人救了你
Someone saved you?

382
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
也可能是某"物"
Or something.

383
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,650
天使
An angel.

384
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,240
或许
Maybe.

385
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,490
等等...
Wait. Wait.

386
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,500
他长的什么样子? 你看到他了吗
What did he look like? Did you see him?

387
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,500
没有 有时...眼见为实
No, sir. But sometimes seeing is believing.

388
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,010
有时...最真实的我们却看不见
And sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can't see.

389
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,180
这些被遗弃的
The forsaken and the abandoned.

390
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,350
小心走 这些可怜的玩具受了不少罪...
Mind your step, now. These poor toys hace suffered enough...

391
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,860
被世人到处抛弃 自生自灭
...being left to rust and decay in the back alleys and cacant lots of the world.

392
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,150
它们怎么会在这儿
What are they doing here?

393
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,530
这是领导的新点子
It's a new concept the boss came up with.

394
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,080
与其丢弃它们 不如收集起来修补一下
Instead of being thrown away, they're collected. Refurbished.

395
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,870
他说这是循环 反覆 再生什么的
He calls it "rebicycling." Something like that.

396
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,540
真令人伤心
Makes me wanna cry...

397
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,880
看到它们这样被虐待
...seeing toys that were treated this way.

398
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,890
这些吊绳都打结的木偶问题才大
These hopelessly entangled string puppets and marionettes...

399
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,350
我们在北极处理这些玩具的人员...
...pose a particular problem. We found the nimble fingers of our work force...

400
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,850
为了打开绳结 可费尽脑筋了...
...here at the North Pole are best for working out those knots and tangles.

401
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,560
谢谢你 这里双保险
Thank you. Double-locked here.

402
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,410
朋友 你就像我一样...
You are just like me, my friend.

403
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,960
一个捣蛋鬼
A scrooge!

404
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,290
埃比尼泽捣蛋鬼
Ebenezer Scrooge.

405
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,800
捣蛋鬼从来不信什么...
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

406
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,880
圣诞节 北极 圣诞老人...等等 全是难以置信 骗人的玩意儿
...it's all a bunch of humbug. A bout of indigestion.

407
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,640
喔 我知道你是啥...
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

408
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,430
你是个"怀疑论"者
You're a doubter.

409
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,140
你怀疑 你不相信...
A doubter. You don't believe!

410
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,480
你是怀疑论者! 你不相信
You're a doubter! You don't beliece!

411
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,500
你错过好戏啦 我们爬过陡坡
You missed it. We rode down some really sharp hills.

412
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,710
然后经过似乎结冰的湖面
We were on what looked like a frozen lake.

413
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
但是我说是视觉假像
But I know it was just an optical illusion.

414
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,130
他说车子是走在冰上 我说这不可能...
He said the train was on ice. I said it's impossible...

415
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,970
因为车轨不可能... 你去哪里
You can't put a train track... Where you going now?

416
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,480
# 我对星星许愿 #
I'm wishing on a star

417
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,820

421
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,080
# 因为他从未来过 #

422
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:03,340
# 圣诞节来临时 我就会想到他 #
I think of him When Christmas comes to town

423
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,300
# 那是一年中最好的时光 #
The best time of the year

424
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,680

# 朋友们都聚在一起竖起了圣诞树 #

# 孩子们的礼物包五颜六色 #

430
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,710
# 这些我都听过 却没见过 #
All the things I've heard about But never really seen

431
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,050
# 圣诞夜没人会睡觉 #
No one will be sleeping

432
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,300
# 圣诞夜的晚上 #
On the night of Christmas Eve

# 翘首盼望圣诞老人降临 #
Hoping Santa 's on his way

435
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,860

442
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,490
看呀
Look.

443
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
北极光
The northern lights.

444
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,040
喂 你们三个
Hey. You three.

445
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,040
我们刚经过...
We just crossed it.

446
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,630
北纬66度33分...北极圈
Latitude 6622'. The Arctic Circle.

447
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,130
你们看到远方的极光吗
And do you see? Those lights in the distance.

448
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,510
看起来像大货船航行在 结冰的海上所发出奇异的光芒
They look like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

449
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,810
那...
There...

450
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,520

A number-seven bow? When we're this close to liftoff?

530
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:52,070
他们在下面想什么? 是不是发疯了

- 路线是什么? - 去美国

Things aren't bad enough. What's his 20?

显然是新泽西州枫树市来的一个孩子...

537
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,890
把泡泡糖粘到妹妹头上

538
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,730
新泽西?是上次那个...
New Jersey? Is that the same kid that put the tack...

539
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,690
在老师身上贴了 一个标签的同一个男孩
...underneath his teacher's chair last year?

540
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,650
不是 长官 这孩子叫斯帝芬
No, sir. This kid's name is Stecen.

541
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,110
我们现在怎么办 首领? 通知圣诞老人
So, what do we do, chief? Alert the big man?

542
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,280
圣诞夜不给他礼物
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

543

但是 把他列入名单 明年复查两次

-Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic? -Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,290
这是唯一能赶到广场的方法
It's the only way to get to the square on time.

553

上车吧
All right, get in.

557
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,160
我不知道这个
I don't know about this.

558
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,400
我没有听到 你呢
I don't hear it. Do you?

559
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,360
也没听到
No.

560
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,490
我觉得该顺着箭头走
I think we should follow those arrows.

561
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,210
我以为这儿会有出路
I thought there'd be a way out.

562
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,590

上面说"比利 圣诞快乐...圣先生赠"

抓住我的脚了
It's got my leg.

01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,380
我抓不住你
I can't hold him.

578
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,840
另外一只手给我 另外一只手给我
Give me your other hand. Give me your other hand.

01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,150
- 你在这儿干嘛? - 和你一样
-What are you doing here? -Same as you.

585
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,910
我在检查我的礼物 确定我清单上的都有
Checking my presents. Making sure I'm getting everything on my list.

586
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,990
我只有一个像样的礼物 其他的全是内衣裤
I found one present. All it had was stupid underwear.

587
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,790
看
Look.

588
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,550
我们随时开始下降
You may start your descent any time now.

589
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,970
当然了 也要看你的方便
At your convenience, of course.

还有五分钟 我们能赶得上
It's still fice to. I think we're gonna make it.

Of course. It's been five to for the last hour.

我们时间多了 我们什么都没有 就是有时间 我们还有时间来消磨
We got plenty of time. We got nothing but time. We got time to kill.

593
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,030
你知道吗? 我们可能无法平安降落
You know what? I don't think we're gonna make it.

594
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,580
虽然我只是个火车长...
I may be just an old railroader...

595
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,540
我不知道怎么飞热气球...
...and know nothing about lighter-than-air craft...

596
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:17,210
但是就我这外行来判断 你们需要再高一点才行
...but from my layman's perspective, you need more altitude!

597
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,840
再高一点

关於火车...

779
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:28,380
驶去哪儿不重要
It doesn't matter where they're going.

780
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:32,590
重要的是你想不想搭车
What matters is deciding to get on.

圣...诞...快...乐
Merry Christmas!

01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,910
妈...爸...醒醒...醒醒
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

787
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:23,080
圣诞老人来过啦...圣诞老人来过啦

妈...爸...快看 他给了我们这么多礼物

在我雪橇座位底下找到的

795
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,060
你最好把破口袋补好
Better fix that hole in your pocket.

796
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:36,480
圣先生赠
Mr. C.

797
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:49,980
好漂亮的铃铛 谁送的
Oh, what a beautiful bell. Who's it from?

798
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,000
- 圣诞老人 - 圣诞老人
-Santa. -Santa?

799
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,790
真的
Really?

800
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,250
- 可惜了 - 这是什么
-Oh, that's too bad. -What's this?

Sorry about that, sport.

803
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,770
孩子们快吧 我们不想迟到
Come on, kids. We don't wanna be late.

804
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:22,320
曾几何时 我大部分的朋友 都能听到铃声
At one time, most of my friends could hear the bell.

805
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:26,530
但是大家过去的这些年头 都已悄悄逝去
But as years passed, it fell silent for all of them.

806
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:32,000
甚至某年莎拉也突然 再也听不见甜美的铃声
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she could no longer hear its sweet sound.

807
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,830
现在我长大了...
Though I've grown old...

808
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,380
还是能听到铃声
... the bell still rings for me.

809
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:40,630
就像所有相信圣诞节的人一样
As it does for all who truly believe.
