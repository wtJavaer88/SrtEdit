1
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,320
喔哦!全球变暖简直要了我的命
Oh boy! This global warming is killing me!

2
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,330
这太热了,而冰河期又太冷了
This is too hot..the ice age was too cold..

3
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,410
怎么才能让你高兴呀?
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,900
这个...我喜欢
This.. I like!

5
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,220
不要跑...Jane! 野营规则...
No running Jane! Camp rules..

6
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,200
有本事来抓我啊,树獭
Make me, Sloth!

7
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,100
叫我...老师
Make me...sir!

8
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,350
这就是尊重...
It's all about respect...

9
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,470
Sarah...你刚吃了饭,休息会儿
Sarah. You just ate! Wait an hour!

10
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,090
Hector! 不不不..你不能在那儿便便
Hector! No,no! You can't pee-pee there!

11
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,880
好...好吧,就在那儿吧
Ok,ok! there is fine..

12
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,810
Ashley! 那样会让你...啊~~~
Ashley! Stop picking your...

13
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,200
抓到他了,耶~~~
Pinata!

14
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,530
住手
Stop!

15
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,730
你应该先戴上眼罩再来
...you're supposed to wear blindfolds!

16
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
没问题
Ok!

17
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,730
Hey~轮到我打这只树獭了
Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth!

18
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,370
-到我啦,到我啦 -应该是我!我!我
..mine..mine...mine....mine!

19
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,450
Hey! 这么轻松就把他打晕了
Hey! You didn't have any candy in you!

20
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,580
让我们把他给埋了
Let's bury him!!

21
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,280
嘿, 嘿! 唔... 是谁让你们这些孩子折磨这个树獭的
Hey, hey! Whoah..Who said you kids can torture the sloth?

22
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,660
Manny, 别打击他们的创造性
Manny, don't squash their creativity..

23
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
嗨,Manny! Diego!!
Hey Manny! Diego!!

24
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,760
我最好的猛犸象和剑齿虎哥们儿
My bad mammal jammel!

25
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,650
帮帮我这只树獭怎么样
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

26
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,450
听着,我搞了一个夏令营
Look.. I opened my camp!

27
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,980
舒适的来玩
Come forth and sit...

28
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,360
也就是Sid夏令营
It means camp of Sid!

29
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,560
恭喜你,现在有两种语言来形容 你这个笨蛋了
Congratulations.You're now an idiot in two languages..

30
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,560
嘘...!
Shhhh...!

31
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,660
别在这些小鬼面前数落我
not in front of the K-l-D-G!

32
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,200
这些小鬼都很喜欢我,对吗,Billy
These little guys love me! Right, Billy?

33
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,910
别逼我吃了你
Don't make me eat you!

34
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,390
很好笑,孩子 所以咯,他们还被叫做小屁孩
Funny, kid!That's why they're called kids!

35
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,040
我告诉过你 Sid..
I told you Sid..

36
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,470
你开营地还不够格
You're not qualified to run a camp..

37
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,720
噢!从什么时候开始照顾孩子 也资格认证扯上关系的?
Oh! Since when do qualifications have anything to do with childcare...?

38
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,640
还有,这些孩子都很尊敬我
Besides, these kids look up to me..

39
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,500
我是他们的好榜样
I'm a role model to them!

40
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,250
我看出来了
I can see that..

41
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,940
你们总是认为我一事无成
You guys never think I can do anything..

42
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,400
但我这个群体中平等的一员
but I'm an equal member of this herd!

43
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,470
这一切都是我自己做到的
I made this herd...!

44
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,030
你们也应该开始对我尊敬一些
...and you need to start treating me with some respect!!

45
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,700
得了吧! Sid!
Come on! Sid!

46
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,060
Sid! 我们只是开玩笑而已
Sid! We were just kidding!!

47
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,530
嘿!
Hey!

48
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,010
让我们和这头猛犸象玩玩!!
Let's play pin the tail on the mammoth!!

49
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,870
Sid!
Sid!

50
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,160
我不会一事无成的
Can you stop!

51
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,260
我一定会得到他们的尊重的
I'm gonna get some respect!!

52
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,090
我会证明给他们看
I'll show 'em!

53
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,100
所以呢,最后~
And so, in the end..

54
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,510
小驴找到了自己的妈咪
the little burro reached his mommy..

55
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,880
他们从此过着幸福的生活
and they lived happily ever after..

56
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,980
真有你的
Good job!

57
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,820
我有问题,为什么驴要回家
Question! Why does the burro go home?

58
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,570
他为什么不和兔子们生活在一起
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbit?

59
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,620
因为...因为他想和家人在一起
Because. He wanted to be with his family

60
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,670
我觉得他应该去找个女驴
I think he should go with the girl burro!

61
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,340
这会是个很好的爱情故事
...That's a better love story!

62
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,860
也好,你下次在给别人说故事时 再让驴这样好了
OK! Well, when you tell your burro story, that's what he'll do.

63
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,570
'驴'只是个代名词而已
'Burro' is a demeaning name...

64
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,700
技术上说,他应该叫"野驴"
Technically, it's called a wild ass!

65
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,070
好吧,那个野驴小子
Fine. The wild ass boy came home...

66
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,710
和他的野驴妈妈一起回家了
...to his wild ass mother...

67
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,050
所以,这也是我为什么叫他驴了
See! That's why I called it a burro!

68
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,230
那只驴会遇到吃饭问题吗
Could the burro have a grazing problem?

69
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,870
-这样会更有故事性 -无聊~~
- That would make him more...relatable.. -Boring!

70
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,640
这一点也不可能
It's not believable!

71
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,180
驴会自相残杀吗 这个结尾并不让人满意
- Do burrows eat their young? - It's not a very satisfying ending!

72
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,560
我有时都要烦透了
Sometimes I throw up!

73
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,170
他们从此过着幸福的生活
They lived happily ever after...

74
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,920
不可能有比这个更让人满意的结尾了
You can't get more satisfying than that!

75
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,750
一个幸福的大家庭
One big happy family!

76
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,400
这是理所当然的
That's the way it supposed to be!

77
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,920
那么,你的幸福家庭在哪里呢
Then, where's your big, happy family?

78
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,480
然后,一只饥饿的老虎要吃小孩儿了
Then...the hungry tiger eat the pesky little kids!!

79
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,630
-你还好吧,哥们儿 -当然,为什么会有事
- You ok, buddy? - Sure, why not?!

80
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,970
-我只是觉得你... -故事时间结束了,没有了
- I just thought you.. - Storytimes over....the end!

81
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,720
-大家快跑啊,想活命就快跑 -Hey~等等
- Out of the way! Run for your lives! - Hey, watch it!

82
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
你们这是去哪儿呢
Where's everybody going?

83
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,500
世界末日就要来了
The world's coming to an end!

84
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,240
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

85
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,170
Fast Tony! 他说这个世界将被洪水淹没
Fast Tony! He says the world's going to flood!

86
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,400
伙计们,我手里拿着的这根小管子
Folks,I hold in my hand a device so powerful..

87
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,610
可以让你把空气
it can actually pull air...

88
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,360
一直呼到天上去
right out of the sky!!

89
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,510
过来看看吧,来看看吧
Gather round...gather round!

90
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,930
打扰一下,您有鳃吗,夫人
Pardon me, do you have gills ma'am?

91
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,930
所以你不能在水里呼吸对吧
So you can't breathe under water?

92
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,630
我的助手可以为你示范
My assistant here will demonstrate!

93
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,720
Hey~~我可以闻到海洋的味道
Hey, I can smell the ocean!

94
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,990
笨蛋,你在这做什么呢
What are you doing...?

95
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,210
我不能卖它了
I can't sell that now...!!

96
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,510
这个是要塞进嘴里的,你个笨蛋
You suck air through your mouth you moron!!

97
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,220
如果你想知道,我现在就给你讲解
If you're a pupil of mine, and I'm starting instruction...

98
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,710
有了这个,不管是横渡海峡,还是 绕着小岛游一圈,都不会有问题
you'll have plenty of air for eons to come!

99
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,970
当然,不要把它放到水下
Of course, don't stay buried!

100
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,090
为什么你要用末日来吓唬大家
Why are you scaring everybody with this doomsday stuff?

101
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,890
啊哈哈哈~ 我只是在讨生活而已,老兄
I'm trying to make a living here pal..

102
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,210
这只是我的预言中的一部分
It's all part of my weather forecast!

103
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,250
五天激烈的水灾,接着就是
The 5 day outlook is calling for intense flooding, followed by..

104
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,440
世界末日!
the end of the world..!!

105
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,930
当薄冰碰到灼热的阳光
With a slight chance of patchy sunshine

106
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,170
接下来的那周...
..later in the week

107
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,610
得了吧,别听他的了
Come on! Don't listen to him..

108
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,080
Fast Tony 为了吃会把自己的老妈卖了
Fast Tony would sell his own mother for a grape!

109
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,580
你在出价吗
Are you making an offer?

110
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,480
我是说,不,我没有胡说
I mean no! I would not!

111
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,130
你们没听说吗,这些冰一直在融化
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting!

112
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,400
这个地方被冰雪覆盖着
You see this ground? It's covered in ice

113
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,950
一千年前就是如此
A thousand years ago it was covered in ice..

114
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,280
一千年以后
A thousand years from now..

115
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,850
也会如此
it will still be ice!

116
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,030
嘿,哥们,呃 且不去质疑你的生存本能
Say, buddy..not to cast aspersions on your survival instincts, but..

117
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,720
那么猛犸象怎么已经走向灭绝了呢
haven't mammoths pretty much gone extinct?

118
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,810
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

119
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,480
我说得是 你应该是你们族的最后一个了
I'm talking about you being the last of your kind!

120
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,930
啊!你没刷牙吧
Ahh! Your breath smells like ants!

121
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,390
既然你不想承认
Be as that as it may..

122
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,810
那你什么时候看见过其它猛犸象呢
When's the last time you saw another mammoth?

123
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,580
啊! 别理他,Manny
Ah! Don't pay any attention to him Manny

124
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,250
猛犸象才不会灭绝
Mammoths can't go extinct..

125
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,890
我们是世界上最庞大的生物
they are the biggest things on earth!

126
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,570
那恐龙呢?
What about the dinosaurs?

127
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,260
恐龙都有怪癖
The dinosaurs got cocky!

128
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,830
-这样会给他们带来敌人 -快看~~
They made enemies! -Look!...

129
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,330
有个白痴准备从冰川上跳下来
some idiot's going down the eviscerator!

130
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,720
噢,拜托 千万别告诉我那是我们的树獭
Please tell me that's not our cue!

131
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,750
好吧,数到三我就跳了
OK..I'm goona jump on the count of 3!

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,900
一~~~
One.....

133
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,090
二~~~
Two.....

134
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,610
Sid! 待在那别动!我们这就上来!
Sid! Don't move a muscle! We're coming up!

135
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,980
跳!跳!跳!跳!跳...
jump!..jump!...jump!..jump!..

136
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,360
~跳!跳!跳!跳!跳~
...jump, jump, jump, jump!

137
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,550
抱歉
Sorry..

138
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,430
2.003
Two and three one thousands...

139
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,270
2.004
Two and four one thousands...

140
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,820
Sid! 你在搞什么鬼呢,快下来
Sid!What are you doing? Get down from there!

141
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,590
没门! 我要成为第一个从这里跳下去的人
No way! I'm going to be the first to jump off the eviscerator...

142
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,580
然后,你们就准备好
And then you guys are gonna have to start..

143
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,240
尊敬我吧
showing me some respect!

144
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,340
如果你从这跳下去了,你唯一会得到的
You jump off this and the only respect you're gonna get..

145
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,690
是大家对死者的尊敬
is respect for the dead!

146
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,230
得了吧,Manny! 他才没那么蠢
Come on Manny! He's not that stupid..!

147
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,110
难道我以前都错了
But, I've been wrong before!

148
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,750
不要拦我!
Geronimo!!!

149
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,620
Hey, 看着点儿!
Hey, watch it!

150
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,070
我不能呼吸了
I can't breath...

151
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,140
我的脾脏都要出来了!
I think I just coughed up my spleen!

152
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,880
啊! Diego! 收回你的爪子,谢谢!
Ahh! Diego! Retract the claws please!

153
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,650
噢,好的,不好意思!
Oh...right...sorry!

154
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
如果不是我了解你,Diego..
You know, if I didn't know you better Diego..

155
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,780
我会认为你怕水,哈哈哈~~
I'd think you're afraid of the water..

156
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,860
好了,好了,这下我更了解你了
Ok..Ok! Good thing I know you better!

157
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,110
伙计们
Guys...!

158
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,620
看来Fast Tony是对的!
Fast Tony was right..!

159
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,410
所有的东西都在融化
everything is melting!

160
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,680
洪水就要泛滥了
It's all gonna flood...

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
快点!我们要告诉他们
Come on! We're gotta warn them.

162
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,320
也许我们可以快速进化成水生动物
Maybe we can rapidly evolve into water creatures.

163
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,070
你真是天才, sid
That's genius, Ed...

164
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,630
叫我"乌贼"
Call me 'Squid'.

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,200
天啊,这里所有的东西都是垃圾
Gees..this whole thing's a piece of junk!

166
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,030
我简直不敢相信我住在这
I can't believe I live here!

167
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,810
怎么了?
What?

168
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,480
这个没用
I can breathe..

169
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,440
我找到了它的革命性产品,我们管它叫做
I present you with this revolutionary gizmo, we call..

170
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
木板!!
Bark!!

171
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,430
最重要的是,它可以浮起来
It's so buoyant, it actually floats!

172
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,550
我会让你看到什么东西能浮起来
I'll show you something that floats!

173
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,220
尽管笑吧,你们的死期快到了
Alright.... it's your funeral!

174
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,940
看到了吧!这正是我所说过的
You see! This is exactly what I'm talking about!

175
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,470
天空中想起巨大的咆哮声
Giant balls of fury larva...

176
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,600
凶恶的猛犸象
the size of mammoths...

177
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,680
疯狂的从天而降
raining from the sky!!

178
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,200
啊!去换口气,多读读书
Ahh! Go suck air through a reed!

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,360
你们得听他的,他说的洪水的事情是对的
You gotta listen to him! He's right about the flood!

180
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,840
我说对了?
I am?

181
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,340
我是说,呃,对 我说的本来就是事实
I mean...uh...Yes, I am!

182
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,340
等一下!是你说的
Wait a minute! You're the one who said..

183
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,590
这里不可能有洪水
there wasn't going to be a flood!

184
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,050
为什么我们现在要听你的
Why should we listen to you?

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
因为我们在上面看到了一切
Because we saw what's up there!

186
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,490
大坝就要垮掉了 整个山谷不久将被洪水淹么
The dam's gonna break. The entire valley is gonna flood!

187
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,670
你们会发现他说的是对的
Flood's real alright..

188
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,420
而且很快会成为事实
and it's coming fast!

189
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,660
看看四周吧,你们在一个碗里
Look around! You're in a bowl..!

190
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,770
这个碗很快将被水充满
Bowl's gonna to fill up...!

191
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,690
而且无路可逃
Ain't no way out...!

192
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,980
我们该怎么办啊?!
What are we going to do?!

193
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,360
除非~~你们可以走到山谷的尽头
Unless, you can make it to the end of the valley..

194
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,550
哪儿有条船,可以救你们
there's a boat...It can save ya!

195
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,370
可我什么也没看出来
I don't see anything..

196
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,370
但是
Fine..

197
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,460
你们的快点,地面一直在融化
You all better hurry..ground's melting..

198
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,500
山崩地裂,地动山摇
walls tumbling..rocks crumbing..

199
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,930
侥幸活下来的,还要面对滔天洪水
survive that, and you'll be racing through water!

200
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,670
还有三天的时间
coz in 3 days time..

201
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,860
你们就准备抱着等死吧
It's going to hit the geyser fields..

202
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,860
Boom!!!
Boom!!!

203
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,460
还是有一些好消息的
There is some good news though!

204
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,780
你们死得越多
The more of you die..

205
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,090
我吃得越好
the better I eat!!

206
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,770
我又没说这个对你们来说是好消息
I didn't say it was good news for you..

207
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,910
他要是去教书一定是个好老师
He must have been a real pleasure to have in class!

208
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,770
MD鄙视你!
Damn!

209
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,840
好了,大家都听到兀鹰说的话了
Alright! You heard the scary vulture..

210
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,710
赶快行动吧
Let's move out!

211
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,850
Manny..你真的认为那艘船存在啊?
Manny.. Do you really think there's a boat?

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,140
不知道,但是没几天..
I don't know..But in a few days this place..

213
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,850
这里就会被洪水淹没了
is gonna to be a mile under water..

214
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,850
如果有任何希望,也是在那儿了
If there's any hope...it's that way

215
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,520
Manny 该走了
Manny, lets go!

216
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,700
您现在看到的是一场大迁徙
We're got an overturned cliff on the far right lake..

217
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,800
现场很拥挤,队伍一望无尽
traffic is packed up as far as the eye can see..

218
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,470
噢! 那边看起来也许很不错的样子
Ohhh! And it looks like there might be a fatality!

219
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,440
我找到了一块肥肉!
I call the dark meat!!

220
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,160
快点,小家伙们,我们要走了 快点,快点,都进来
Come on everybody! Lets go! Come on. Come..come..come! Get in!

221
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,890
别这样,爷爷 别这样,我们走吧
Come on Granpa, come on! We have to go!

222
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,270
我不走
Well, I'm not leaving!

223
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,680
我生在这个洞里,就是死也要死在这里面
I was born in this hole and I'll die in this hole!

224
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,920
我们有必要带这么重的粪球吗?
Do we have to bring this crap..?

225
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,660
我肯定这个东西到处都有
I'm sure there's crap where we're going!

226
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,700
啊! 这是我妈妈给的礼物
Ahh! This was a gift from my mother!

227
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,220
很好,继续走,不要停 Manny, Manny!
- Ok! Keep it moving..keep it moving! - Manny, Manny!

228
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,050
我听说你就要绝种了
I've just heard you're going extinct!

229
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,370
Hey!如果你能生
Hey! If you ever master hygiene..

230
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,080
敏感点好吧
try working on sensativity!!

231
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,890
我才不会绝种哩
I'm not going extinct!

232
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,890
孩子们,看哪
Kids! Look...!

233
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,590
最后的猛犸象
The last mammoth!

234
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,630
哇啊!!这辈子可能见不到第二只了
Well, you probably won't see another one of those again!

235
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,770
看到了吧
See?!

236
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,300
一,二,三...James去哪了?
Where is James?

237
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,060
Stu! 别玩了! Stu!
Stu! Come on! Stu!

238
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,110
我们得赶快离开这里!
Lets blow this ice cube stand!

239
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,130
Stu!!
Stu!!

240
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,250
伙计们!我们中间已经 有个兄弟牺牲在山谷啦
Folks! Be the first in the valley to have your very own mobile home!

241
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,260
“有一天,当你要唱歌..”
Some day, when you're gonna sing..

242
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,310
“当你让我们一起唱...”
When you make us sing...

243
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,380
-闭嘴!Sid! -好吧
- Shut up Sid! - Ok!

244
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,700
"等等,hey-hey...那是什么声音..?"
Stop, hey-hey...What's that sound..?

245
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,470
"所有的猛犸象都躺在地上" 表再唱了 sid!
- All the mammoths are in the ground. - Stop singing Sid!

246
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,620
Sid! 我要再一次落在你的身上 而且这一次,我会杀了你
Sid! I'm gonna fall on you again! And this time I will kill you!

247
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,230
好吧,我还以为你喜欢经典老歌呢
Ok..someone doesn't like the classics!

248
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,730
如果你是对的
What if you're right?

249
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,150
如果我是最后的猛犸象怎么办？
What if I am the last mammoth?

250
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,150
可是 Manny 往好的方面想,你还有我们啊
But Manny,look on the bright side..you have us!

251
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,070
这么久了 你终于说了句象样的话, Sid!
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid!

252
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,650
猛犸象？
Mammoths?

253
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,330
我就知道我不会是最后的猛犸象
I knew I couldn't be the last one!

254
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,090
已经闻到它的味道了
I felt it in my trunk!

255
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,370
就是他了
This stinks!

256
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,650
我来了
Come on!

257
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,520
抱歉,我的胃...
Sorry! My stomach...

258
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,520
搞得我很难受!
hates me!

259
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,620
该死的,臭死我啦,真晦气
Well...Don't that put the 'stink' in extinction!

260
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,790
天那!
Whooa!

261
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,960
真臭
Sheesh!!

262
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,050
噢....太恶心了!
Oooh....Nasty!

263
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,200
Manny?
Manny?

264
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,960
我,呃~我需要一个人静一会儿
I ah..I need to be alone for a while..

265
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,220
你们先走吧,我会赶上来的
You go on ahead..I'll catch up!

266
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
孤独的生活是最枯燥的
One truly is the lonliest number...

267
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,660
-啊! -啊!...嘿!
-Ow! -Ow!...Hey!

268
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,280
噢..这些真不错!!
Ohh..these work great!!

269
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,450
酷!
Cool!

270
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,820
想我吗...想我吧 试试抓到我就让你亲
Missed me...missed me! Try and come and kiss me!!

271
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,880
我来抓住他们
I'll get 'em!

272
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,040
哪边是屁屁啊？
Which end is up?

273
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,710
我打赌,他两边都是
I dunno..That makes two!

274
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,420
嘿, 丑鬼!
Hey, ugly!

275
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,260
阿!...我还靠它坐呢
Ow!...I've got to sit on that!

276
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,550
逮到你了吧
Got you!

277
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,670
好的,我去守那边!
Ok! I'm going in!

278
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,600
Sid! 怎么了?!
- Sid! - What?!

279
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,510
我感到一些躁动咯
I felt some breeze in that one!

280
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,640
笑!
Smile!

281
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,890
在这呢!
Over here!

282
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,270
-投降吗? -决不!
- Surrender? - Never!

283
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,310
酷!!
Cool!!

284
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,270
如果有人问起来,就说他们有50多个
If any one asks..there were 50 of them..

285
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,370
而且...他们都是...响尾蛇!
...And...they were...rattlesnakes!

286
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,930
这儿呢,小猫猫
Here kitty-kitty..

287
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,890
大错特错了你们这些,鼹鼠!
Big mistakes you miscreants!

288
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,330
鼹鼠?
Miscreants?

289
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,560
呃..Diego,他们是负鼠
Uh..Diego, they're possum..

290
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,650
撤~~退!
Retreat!

291
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,920
我想现在只剩下你和我了
I guess it's just you and me now..

292
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,870
我就知道!我就知道我不是唯一一个!!
I knew it! I knew I wasn't the only one!

293
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,730
我也是!别人也都常常从树上掉下来
Me too! Everyone falls out of the tree every now and then..

294
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,040
只是他们不承认
they just don't admit it!

295
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,250
等等,你说什么？
Wait...what?

296
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,170
他们很多都不善于挂在树枝上
Some of us have a tough time holding on to branches

297
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,000
我们又不是蝙蝠
I mean it's not like we're bats or something..

298
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,380
我们没有翅膀保持自己在上面
We don't have wings to keep us up!

299
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,620
那么,你爬在树上是...因为...?
And you were in the tree..because?

300
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,300
我在找我的哥哥们
I was looking for my brothers..

301
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,010
他们总是惹麻烦
They are always getting into trouble..

302
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,690
哥哥？你的意思是还有很多？
Brothers? You mean there's more?

303
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,720
当然!
Sure!

304
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,610
多着呢
..lots of us

305
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,750
在哪呢?
Where?

306
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,020
到处都是
Everywhere..

307
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,900
石头下面,地洞里啊...
under rocks and holes in the ground...

308
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,180
我们通常晚上出来行动  这样鸟儿就不会把我们抓走了
Usually we come out at night, so birds don't carry us off!

309
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,500
救命!救命啊!
Help! Help!

310
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,430
噢,谢天谢地,称呼我预言家
Well!!Shave me down and call me a mole-rat!!

311
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,450
你竟然找到了另一头猛犸象!
You're found another mammoth!

312
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,410
在哪呢?
Where?

313
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,480
等等!不是说猛犸象早就绝种了么
Wait a minute! I thought mammoths were extinct!

314
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,160
你们看着我干吗?
What are looking at me for?

315
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,440
不清楚
I don't know..

316
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,620
也许因为你就是猛犸象
Maybe because you are a mammoth?

317
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,410
我?!
Me?!

318
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,300
别开玩笑了!我不是猛犸,我是一直负鼠!
Don't be ridiculous! I'm not a mammoth! I'm a possum!

319
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,280
恩,不错的笑话,我是一只蝾螈
Right, good one! I'm a newt...

320
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,120
这是我的朋友,獾獾
This is my friend, the badger..

321
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,500
和我另一个朋友,鸭嘴兽
and my other friend the platypus!

322
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,360
为什么我是鸭嘴兽？要他去当!
Why do I got to be the platypus! Make him the platypus!

323
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,040
这家伙给你麻烦了吗？妹妹
This guy giving you trouble, Sis?

324
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,090
妹妹?
Sis?

325
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,100
没错,这就是我的哥哥们
That's right, these are my brothers..

326
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,780
负鼠...负鼠...负鼠
Possum....Possum....Possum

327
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,380
我可不认为他们三个 都能上到树的最高枝
I don't think her tree goes all the way to the top branch!

328
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,990
Manny 这对要灭绝的物种可不是挑剔的时候
Manny, the brin of extinction is a bad time to be picky

329
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,270
嘿...她可以跟我们一起走!
Hey...She should come with us!

330
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,950
你疯了吗?没门!
Are you insane? No way!

331
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,230
好吧! Manny叫我来问你们是否愿意跟我们一起逃离洪水
Ok! Manny wants me to ask you if you'd like to escape the flood with us

332
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,080
我
What the?

333
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,550
那我宁可去死!
I'd rather be road kill!

334
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,050
我可以如你所愿!
That could be arranged!

335
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,440
哈....真好笑!
Ha....funny!

336
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,020
让我跟我的哥哥们说几句话
Let me have a little word with my brothers..

337
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,260
Ellie! 你疯了吗？我们才不跟他们一起走呢
Ellie! Are you crazy? We're not going with them!

338
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,860
听着! 我们从来都只是在晚上出行
Look! We'll never make it in time if we only travel at night..

339
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,850
这些家伙可以在白天的野外保护我们   你说呢?
These guys can protect us out in the open. What do you say?

340
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,180
哇!你为什么要邀请他们?
- Ow! - Why did you invite them?

341
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,780
因为你们俩可能就是地球上最后的两只猛犸象了
Because you might be the only two mammoths left on earth.

342
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,980
他说的对!
He has a point!

343
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,840
请问,我什么时候加入这个交友俱乐部了?
I'm sorry. When did I join this dating service?

344
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,090
我和我的哥哥们愿意加入你们
My brothers and I would be delighted to come with you..

345
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,090
如果,你对我们好一点的话
if...you treat us nicely!

346
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,700
看见没,这...这可完全是不好的一面
See that! That's the total opposite of nice!

347
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,480
也许我们在上路前会有些点心吃
Maybe we'll have ourselves a little snack before we hit the road

348
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,090
想吃点吗？我们上!
Want a piece of us? lets go!

349
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,560
冲啊~~
Bonsai....!

350
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,750
-我抓住他了 -哇!
- I got him! - Ow!

351
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,270
你知道最惨的是什么吗？
You know the best part...?

352
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,740
我们身上携带着病菌
We're carrying diseases!

353
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,440
好了!多亏了Sid...
Ok! Thanks to Sid...

354
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,080
我们要同舟共济了
we're now travelling together...

355
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,410
不管喜不喜欢
and like it or not...

356
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,710
我们都要组成一个幸福的大家庭了
we're going to be one big happy family!

357
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,050
我当爸爸
I'll be the daddy..

358
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,890
Ellie当妈妈
Ellie will be the mommy..

359
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,570
而Diego会是那个吃掉找麻烦的小孩子的叔叔
And Diego will be the uncle who eats the kids who get on my nerves!

360
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,920
好了,我们走,赶在我们的脚被地面的裂缝卡住之前离开!
Now let's move, before the ground falls out from under our feet!

361
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,740
我本以为胖家伙都很快乐
I thought fat guys are suppose to be jolly..

362
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,990
我并不胖  是这些皮毛让我看起来庞大了些
I'm not fat! It's this fur that makes me look big!

363
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,810
有点膨胀
It's poofie!

364
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,370
噢,是的,是的,他还说自己不胖
Ok..he's fat..

365
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,090
伙计们!逃避洪灾
Folks! Escape from the flood is a..

366
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,680
是个减肥的好时候
perfect time to shed those unsightly pounds...

367
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,580
只要你选择了fast Tony的灾难食物
with fast Tony's....disaster diet!

368
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,180
就是你,夫人 你看起来就是个又高又壮的野兽
You, ma'm! You look like a big fat hairy beast!

369
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,380
想不想减掉一两吨呢?
How'd you like to lose a tonne or two of that?

370
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,990
你怎么知道的
Would I ever!!..

371
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,950
别听他的 Vera!
Don't listen to him, Vera!

372
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,590
你已经瘦的很完美了
You're already thin as a twig..

373
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,730
我同样有很好的治疗近视的办法  我的盲人朋友
I also have the perfect cure for your eyesight, my blind friend!

374
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,070
噢...我们这样速度太慢了
Ohh...We'll never make it at this pace!

375
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,050
Ellie, 没事了!你可以出来了!
Ellie, it's ok!You can lose the camouflage!

376
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,300
你安全了!
You're safe!

377
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,750
知道了...安全了？
Ok....safe?

378
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,290
拜托!! Crash....Eddie...
Please!! Crash....Eddie...

379
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,550
你们两个,查看一下
You two...Go scope it out!

380
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,660
你那什么情况？ 所有危险警报解除,队长
- What you got? -Perimeter looks to be all clear captain

381
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,560
收到,一点钟方向,完毕
Roger that..four-niner, over!

382
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,800
收到,完毕,啊
Roger. Over!

383
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,770
警报解除
All clear!

384
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,580
鹰!!
Hawk!!

385
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,200
你干吗呢？
What are you doing?

386
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,960
装死!
Playing dead..!

387
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,390
Manny...你为什么不这样?
Manny...Why don't you do that?

388
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,260
因为,我是一只猛犸象!
Because, I'm a mammoth!

389
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,850
那你伪装时也这么做,对吗？
But you do it for treats, right?

390
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,430
他飞走了吗?
Is he gone?

391
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,930
你安全了,起来吧
You're safe! Get up..

392
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,810
伙计,如果不是你在..
Man!...if you weren't here..

393
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,480
那只鹰就会盘旋下来
that hawk would have swooped down..

394
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,950
把我刁走当晚餐了
and snatched me up for dinner!

395
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,380
我堂兄Wilson就是这么死的
That's how Cousin Wilson went!

396
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,100
哥们儿,我能理解你的心情
Boy, I really feel for you, I do!

397
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,150
真难想象
I can't even imagine what it would be like...

398
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,490
做为你们这种族最后一只的滋味
to be the last one of your species!

399
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,550
我不是最后一个
I'm not the last one!

400
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,870
噢...聪明,聪明的孩子
Oh...You brave, brave soul....

401
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,590
这样就对了,不要轻言放弃
that's right, don't give up hope..

402
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,900
Ellie?
Ellie?

403
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,260
看看我们的脚印
Look at our footprints....

404
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,620
他们形状是一样的
they're the same shape

405
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,190
我怎知这些不是你自己踩的
Well, how do I know those aren't your footprints?

406
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,290
那好
Well...then..

407
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,430
看看我俩的影子,多配
look at our shadows..we match!

408
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,540
是啊,我们是一样的
You're right! We're the same!

409
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,650
你可能也是一只负鼠
You must be part possum!

410
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,890
你别妄想
You wish!

411
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,700
Diego, 所有人都比你走得快,快点
Diego, there are whole continents moving faster than you...lets go!

412
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,980
我们得赶上别人
We got to catch up with the others!

413
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,560
嘿! 别闹了
Hey! Knock it off!!

414
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,970
噢 想哭就哭吧,胆小鬼开心点
Oh cry me a river, blubber tooth tiger. Have some fun!

415
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,800
你们俩没注意到这冰已经薄到不踩也会塌的程度了吗？
Can't you see the ice is thin enough..without you two wearing it down?

416
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,820
噢, Diego 冰可能薄了一点,但也能承受
Oh, Diego. The ice may be thin, but its strong enough to hold...

417
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,380
10吨的猛犸和9吨的小负鼠了
a ten ton mammoth and a nine ton possum!

418
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,250
Ellie...起来!你再装,就真死了
Ellie...get up! If you play dead...you'll be dead!

419
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,560
看着我
Look at me!

420
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,150
Diego?
Diego?

421
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,810
Diego!
Diego!

422
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,950
快走
Come on....

423
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,670
快啊
Come on!

424
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,480
可能有点疼
This may sting a little..

425
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,240
那究竟是什么怪兽啊？
What in the animal kingdom was that?

426
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,240
不清楚,不过现在起,地上安全
I don't know, but from now on...playing safe..!

427
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,100
水里,不安全
Water? Not safe!

428
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,040
刚刚是我见到最勇敢的事
That..... was the bravest thing I've ever seen..

429
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,850
真的没什么,我...呃~
It was nothing really, I..

430
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,460
噢! 不是在表扬你
Oh! It's not a compliment...!

431
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,340
对于负鼠,傻子才勇敢
To a possum...bravery is just dumb!

432
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,740
对! 我们没骨气
Yeah! We're spineless..

433
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,160
胆小的
Lily-livered!

434
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,280
可能猛犸绝种的原因
Maybe mammoths are going extinct because

435
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,460
就是因为他们太爱冒险了
they put themselves in danger too often!

436
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,130
也许你该保守一点
Maybe you should run away more!

437
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,480
说得真好,多谢建议
Good point! Thanks for the advice!

438
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,950
高兴能帮上忙
Happy to help!

439
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,730
你们也相信吗？
Do you believe her?..

440
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,950
"傻子才勇敢,也许你该常常跑远一点"
"Bravery is just dumb! Maybe you should just run away more.."

441
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,730
她真是又讨厌,又笨蛋,而且没见识
She's infuriating and stubborn and narrow-minded!

442
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,650
你喜欢上她了
You like her...

443
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,930
我没有
I do not!

444
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,000
别担心,在我这里你的秘密不会传出去的
Don't worry; your secret is safe with me!

445
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,010
-噢...也包括你的 -什么秘密？
- Oh...and so is yours.. - What secret?

446
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,680
你知道的,你不太会游泳的事情
You know.. ...the one where you can't swim

447
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,320
真荒缪
That's ridiculous!

448
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,610
没关系,现在世界都要融化了,兄弟
Fine, but we're living in a melting world buddy!

449
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,170
你非得面对这恐惧不可,迟早的事
You're gonna have to face your fears...sooner...or later

450
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,910
好啦,准备好了没 Eddie?
Ok! Ready Eddie?

451
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,340
好了,我们滚吧
Set! Let's roll!

452
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,420
等我一下!!
Wait for me!!

453
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,370
不等你们了,接着滚了
Dont wait....gotta roll...

454
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,980
下一站等你们
meet you at the other end!

455
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,950
看,她适合我吗？
So, you think she's girl for me?

456
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,520
没错,她很好玩,你一点都不好玩
Oh, yeah. She's tons of fun...

457
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,700
你一点都不好玩
and you are no fun at all!

458
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,080
她使你完整
She completes you!

459
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,940
耶, 耶!!
Yeah, yeah!!

460
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,710
嘿! 嘿, Manny!
Hey! Hey, Manny!

461
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,120
你能拉弯树枝
Can you pull back the tree...

462
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,610
-把我弹到前面去吗？ -不能
- and shoot me in the pond? - No!

463
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
噢...来嘛
Aw...come on..

464
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,360
这个态度怎么能打动Ellie
Now..how do you expect to impress Ellie with that attitude?!

465
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,570
- 我不要打动她! - 那你为什么
- I don't wanna impress her! - Then why are you trying so hard to...

466
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,390
这么努力去说服她她是一头猛犸
...convince her that she's a mammoth?

467
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,130
因为她本来就是
Because, that's what she is!!

468
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,270
我才不在乎她以为自己是负鼠
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum....

469
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,850
她不可能两种都是
You can't be two things!

470
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,730
背叛啊,我的手下败将
On contraire.....my...friend!

471
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,480
告诉牛蛙小鹰或者斑鸠吧
Tell that to the bullfrog, the chicken hawk or turtle-dove!

472
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,060
他以后不会驮你了
He's never gonna let up on you!

473
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,580
别管这事,我们都会轻松些
It'll be easier if you just go with it!

474
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,940
那你们要我做什么来着
So, what you want me to do?

475
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,190
拉回树枝
Pull back the tree...

476
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,870
把我射到前面去
...and shoot me into the pond!

477
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,190
不明白
I don't know..

478
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,840
那好,如果你太差劲做不了
Well, if you are too lame to do it...

479
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,940
-我们也就找不到Ellie了 -不不不
- we can get Ellie. - No..no..no....no..

480
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,040
我能,我能
I can do it, I can do it!

481
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,760
耶... 加油加油!
Yeah..yeah. Come on..come on!

482
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,290
你以前这么做过吗？
Have you done this before?

483
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,290
哈! 也就一百多万遍吧!
Ha! Only a million times!

484
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,960
再低点,再低点
Farther, farther, farther...

485
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,580
非常好
Perfect...!

486
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,920
开火!
Fire!

487
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,280
我能飞啦
I can fly...!

488
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,780
我相信我能飞翔
I believe I can fly..

489
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,590
Crash!!
Crash!!

490
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,870
Crash, Crash!!
Crash, Crash!!

491
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,300
-Crash, 你还好吗? -到底怎么了?
Crash, you ok? What happened?

492
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Manny 把他从树上射了出去!
Manny shot him out of the tree!

493
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,330
你有毛病吗？
What's wrong with you?

494
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,710
他说他能行
He said he could do it!!

495
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,260
然后你就听了他的了
...and you listened to him!

496
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,510
Crash, 你怎么都行
Crash, whatever you do...

497
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,080
千万别死!
don't go into the light!

498
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,690
我这儿能帮点什么吗？
Can I help in anyway here?

499
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,520
你做得够多了
You've done enough!

500
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,390
你们现在满意了吧!
Are you happy now?

501
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,070
Crash..Crash..别丢下我!
Crash..Crash..don't leave me!

502
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,790
以后谁来掩护我
Who's gonna watch my back?

503
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,870
以后谁来当我的战友
Who's gonna be my wee man of mayhem?

504
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,900
以后谁来帮我滚木头
Who's gonna roll in that dung patch with me?!!

505
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,370
滚木头?!
Dung patch?!

506
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,880
等等...! 我的腿!
Wait...! My legs...!

507
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,660
我能站起来
I can stand!

508
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,310
-他能站起来! -我能跑!
- He can stand! - I can run!

509
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,690
-他能跑,这真是个奇迹!
- He can run! It's a miracle!

510
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,070
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

511
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,920
我能说什么,这些男孩子...
What can I say?... They're boys...

512
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,110
他们使我的生命充满了冒险
...they make my life a little adventure!

513
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,090
你们几个死定了
You guys are so dead!

514
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,640
她不算那么糟
She's not half bad...

515
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,130
她很疯狂、很让人不解
crazy and confused, but..

516
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,690
但很可爱
Sweet!

517
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,440
那又怎么
So?

518
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,130
那你被什么束缚了？
So what's holding you back?

519
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,180
我的家庭
My family

520
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,810
你可以重新拥有一个,对吧
You can have that again, you know...

521
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,320
不 Sid 我不能
No, Sid. I can't!

522
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,500
好了,好了,不过想想你要是错过机会
Ok, ok. But, but, but, think about it! I mean if you let this chance go..

523
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,270
你们整个物种就完了,那会很...很...
you're just letting your whole speices go! And that's just...that's just.....

524
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,320
..自私
..selfish!

525
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,690
我觉得我开始习惯了
I think I'm starting to get through to him!

526
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,200
等等,我抓到你们了   没问题
Wait, wait! I got you!

527
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,720
需要帮忙吗?
Need help?

528
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,530
不,我只是喘口气就行
No, no! Just catching my breath...

529
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,330
- 你卡住了 - 我没有
- You're stuck. - I am not!

530
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,180
那好,那我们出发吧
Alright then, let's go..

531
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,120
我不能
I can't...

532
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,460
我被卡住了
I'm stuck!

533
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,260
你不觉得...
Don't you think that..

534
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,000
像这样搬走这些...
picking them up like this..

535
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,090
会比较容易吗?
would be easier?

536
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,010
Ellie?
Ellie?

537
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,960
我认识这地方
I know this place...

538
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,530
其实
You know....

539
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,460
在心底我也晓得自己有点与众不同
deep down, I knew I was different..

540
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,100
我确实比其他负鼠小孩大一点点
I was a little bigger than the other possum kids..

541
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,630
好啦,是大很多
Ok, a lot bigger!

542
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,820
噢! 现在我明白为何其他负鼠男生
Oh! Now I understand why the possum boys..

543
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,900
没发现我的可爱了
didn't find me appealing!

544
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,100
那太糟了
That's too bad...

545
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,850
因为,对于猛犸来说 你还是挺...
Because, as far as mammoths go, you're..

546
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,000
- 你知道的...! - 什么?
- you know...! - What?

547
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,170
迷人
Attractive!

548
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,630
真的吗?
Really?

549
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,650
- 当然 - 我哪里迷人?
- Sure... - What about me is attractive?

550
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,140
嗯~不清楚
Well, I don't know...

551
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,680
嗯~你~呃~
well...there's you're...uh...

552
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,780
臀部?
butt?

553
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,100
臀部怎么了?
What about it?

554
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,750
它~
It's....

555
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,640
大
big?

556
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,280
噢,你只是说说而已
Oh, you're just saying that!

557
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,360
不,不
No, no...

558
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,730
不,我说真的,它非常大
No, I mean it! It's huge..!

559
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,090
是我见过最大的臀部
biggest darn butt I've ever seen...

560
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,050
噢...你嘴真甜!
Oh...that is really sweet!

561
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,930
今天真疯狂
What a crazy day!

562
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,750
今天早上醒来我还是负鼠
This morning I woke up a possum...

563
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,500
可现在...我却是一头猛犸了
and now...I'm a mammoth!

564
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,630
小子 Manny今天带Ellie去山谷玩
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap with Ellie today...

565
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,770
- 他去了 - 是的
- He sure did. - Yup

566
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,580
他会打消疑虑
He stood on the shore of uncertainty...

567
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,520
一头轧下去,哗啦
and dove right in...Splash!!

568
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,440
很勇敢,对吧
Kind of brave, huh...?

569
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,460
他面对他的害怕的方式
the way he faced his...fear!

570
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,900
我怎么知道
I wouldnt know...

571
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,300
剑齿虎从不知道害怕
Sabre's don't feel fear!

572
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,760
噢, 别这么说,动物都会害怕
Oh, come on! All animals feel fear..

573
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,540
他把我们和安全分开了
It's what separates us from safe!

574
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,930
石头,只有石头才不懂害怕
Rocks! Rocks have no fear...

575
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,120
所以,他们沉底了
and they sink!

576
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,360
你又发什么傻,Sid?
What are you getting at, Sid?

577
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,610
你也许会很惊讶   我,同样地
It may surprise you to know that I too..

578
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,090
也会感到..害怕
have experienced....fear!

579
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,220
- 不是吧,你？ - 噢,是啊!
- No! You? - Oh, yes!

580
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,030
可能发生的情况是
As impossible as it seems...

581
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,460
有天敌会来..
the sloth has natural enemies that would like to..

582
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,100
伤害或者..
harm, or otherwise...

583
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,600
杀死我们树懒
kill us!

584
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,130
我好奇为什么？
I wonder why!

585
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,740
噢,因为嫉妒,大多数的情况
Oh, jealousy mostly. But the point is...

586
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,590
关键是说,害怕是正常的
that fear is natural!

587
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,610
只有猎物才害怕
Fear.....is for prey!

588
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,330
那么,你就让水把你变成了
Well then... You're letting the water make you..

589
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,590
它的猎物!
it's prey!

590
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,180
跳进水里,凭着自己的本能就可以了
Just jump in and trust your instincts!

591
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,430
很多动物从小就会游泳
You know, most animals can swim as babies...

592
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:10,610
对老虎来说
and for a tiger...

593
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,750
游泳就像是撕开一只被卡住的
It's like crawling on your belly...

594
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,880
无助的猎物的肚子一样简单
to stalk helpless prey!

595
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,880
用猎物做个比喻,如何？
Put that hunt on, ok?!

596
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,990
抓一下,踢一下
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick...

597
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,420
我在撕我的猎物
I'm stalking the prey!

598
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,420
抓一下,踢一下
Claw, kick...now...

599
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,630
现在我伸出脑袋
I look back over my shoulder..

600
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,020
看看是否被跟踪了
to see if I am being followed...

601
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,260
我换气
and I'm breathing!

602
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,020
我再撕,再撕
and I'm stalking and I'm stalking...

603
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,860
我掉下来了
I am falling...

604
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,330
很对,你沉底了
Correction! You're sinking...

605
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,400
就像石头
kind of like a rock!

606
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,180
嘿,我们要做些小把戏吗
Hey, do we do any special tricks like...

607
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,870
比如打个滚? 或者
roll over? Or do we just...

608
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,870
只是坐着等
throw our weight around?

609
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,490
抱歉,我还不清楚自己的力气有多大
Sorry, I don't know my own strength yet!

610
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,750
Ellie 你了解我们
Ellie, do you realise that...

611
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,850
可能有机会拯救我们这物种了吗？
now we have a chance to save our species?

612
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,980
真的吗？我们要怎么做才行呢？
Really? How are we going to do that?

613
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,620
这个...你知道的
Well, you know...

614
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,720
-噢! 噢!你是不是说?! -不...
-Oh! Uh, uh! Did you just?! -No...

615
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,770
- 我不是这个意思 - 我刚做猛犸象不到5分钟
- I didn't mean. - I'm not a mammoth for five minutes..

616
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,260
你就开始打我的主意?
... and you're hittin' on me?

617
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,810
我不是这个意思
I wasn't saying...

618
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,300
不是现在,我...
not right now. I'm...

619
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,470
到时候再说
in time...!

620
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,340
我的意思是
I was just saying that it's..

621
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,510
这是我们的责任
our responsibility...

622
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,470
- 什么?! - 我说错了吗!
- What?! - That came out wrong!

623
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,730
你非常漂亮
You're very pretty...

624
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,900
不过我们还才刚刚认识
But, we just met...

625
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,320
责任？
Responsibility...?!

626
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,200
只是尽你的责任吗？ 就为了这个？
Just doing your duty, huh? Is that it?

627
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,050
准备好做最终的牺牲
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice...

628
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,930
来拯救你自己的物种
to save your species!

629
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,420
我告诉你个消息
Well, I got some news for you..!

630
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,580
你今晚救不了这个物种
You not saving the species tonight...

631
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,350
以后哪天晚上也救不了
or any other night!

632
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,560
你们相处得如何？
So, how did it go?

633
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,570
恩 ! 不太糟
Hmm! Not bad...

634
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,670
好了,我们出发
Ok, let's go!

635
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,450
我们整个白天都跟着你们
We traveled with you all day...

晚上你们跟着我们
now you coming with us at night!

637
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,360
但是,晚上我们看不见东西
but we can't see at night

638
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,540
那就享受这盲目吧
Then enjoy...the flood!

639
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,100
我都不愿多看一眼了
I can't even look at him!

640
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,260
变态!
Pervert!

641
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,430
多交朋友
Making friends..

642
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,390
到哪里都该多交朋友
everywhere you go! Just making friends!

643
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,260
小心!那里有块石头
Watch out, there's a stump!

644
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,540
现在没有了
Not anymore...

645
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,080
我觉得我们可以走在一块
I thought we could walk together

646
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,680
Crash, 问问那人为什么这么想？
Crash, ask the man why he thinks that?

647
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,040
她说了她觉得你是个窝囊废
She said she thinks you are a jerk...

648
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,280
要你走开
and to go away!

649
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,350
她没说...啊!
She didn't say...Oww!

650
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,890
也许我们该多花点时间
Look! Maybe if we spend more time..

651
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,880
告诉他   我现在需要一点私人空间
Tell him that I need a little personal space right here!

652
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,430
她说了,你该去跳湖
She said...go jump in a lake...

653
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,130
负鼠裁定了
and possums rule!

654
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,240
我不能听她的
I can hear her, you know?

655
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,720
那你要什么,想捣乱吗
What do you want? A medal?

656
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,250
别乱动!
Stop moving!

好笑,你的真正计划是什么？

噢,很抱歉...

666
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,290
如果我之前说的冒犯了你
if what l said before offended you!

667
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,470
"如果冒犯"是什么意思?
What do you mean 'if' it offended me?

668
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,090
是的,你确实冒犯了她!

我的意思是,我是冒犯了

你就是有点反应过度,没别的了

673
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,210
还有其它生命也悬在这呢
There are other lives at stake here!

674
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:41,600
等等,他说到点子上了
Wait a minute! He's got a point!

675
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,740
没有,什么都没说清楚
He's got nothing!

676
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,230
- 你们不明白 - 他不够感性
- It was a misunderstanding! - It was insensitive!

677
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,610
那快道歉!
Apologize!

678
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,380
为啥是我？是她反应过度
Why me? She overreacted...!

00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,630
就道歉就成
Just apologize!!

你是说,你...?

00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,300
不是别的话,我就掉下去了
Not another word or Ill come down there

我们终于一起做了一件算是正确的事情
I guess we finally did something right together!

690
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,770
嘿, 不用理我
Hey, don't mind me...

691
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,910
我只在悬崖上挂一会儿
just hanging off the cliff here!

692
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,060
记得那些不错的老日子吗？
Remember the good old days?

693
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,330
什么不错的老日子？
Which good old days?

694
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,650
噢, 你知道的  比如昨天、上星期
Oh, you know. Yesterday...last week...

695
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,510
爬上爬下逍遥自在
Back when the trees when up and down...

696
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,900
陆地在我们脚下
and the ground stayed under our feet!

697
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,540
是啊,那些日子是不错
Yup! Those were the good days!

698
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,860
负鼠是负鼠
Possums were possums and...

699
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,110
猛犸是猛犸
mammoths were mammoths...!

700
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,650
我们该睡觉了
We should get some sleep...

701
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,430
是啊,可能明天我们都要死了
Yeah, tomorrow is the day the vulture said we're all gonna die!

702

不,不,不,我不要了...

这里肯定有人喜欢我
Somebody here likes Sid...!

709
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,190
谁装扮那个的

我就知道是时候
Well. You know, it's about time...

别人该发现我的潜质了
someone recognised my true potential!

715
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,020
让火降临吧
Let there be fire!!

716
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,330
大家看看我
If only the guys could see me now!

717
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,030
要么这会是件很好的事情
This is either really good

718
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,710
要么就非常的糟糕
or...really bad..!

00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,490
噢! 不不不不,我是火之君王啊
Oh! No, no, no! Me fire king...

720
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,810
你们怎么杀火之君王呢？
Why kill fire king? A thousand years...

721
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,980
一千多年前 坏juju就因为杀了火之君王...
bad ju-ju for killing fire king!!

722
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,420
地核里的巨热神灵
Superheated rock from the Earth's core..

723
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,060
在寻求融化
is surging to the crust, melting ice...

724
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,090
几千年的冰层
built up over thousands of years!

725
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,130
你们可真冒险
You're a very advanced race. Together...

726
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,690
我们一起能找到一个解决方案的!
we can look for a solution!

727
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,320
我们已经有了...献祭上火之君主
We have one!..Sacrifice the fire king!

728
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,130
这没多大用吧
Well, thats not very advanced...

729
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,130
值得试试
Worth a shot...!

730
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,880
坏ju-ju!!

水？水!
Water?  Water!!

732
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,680
Crash 告诉过你睡觉前别喝水
Crash, I told you not to drink before bed!

733
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
这不是我尿的
I didn't do this...!

734
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,090
至少不是全部
At least not all of it!

735
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,640
- 发生什么了? - 我们睡过头了
- What's happening? - We overslept...

736
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,740
我们该走了
We need to move

737
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,960
我们是最后还活着的生命了？
What if we're last creatures left alive?

738
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,020
- 该我们重新在地球上繁衍 - 怎么繁衍...?
- We'll have to repopulate the earth! - How...?

739
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,730
大家都要么是公的要么是母的了
Everyone's either a dude or a sister!

740
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:28,910
嗨
Hi

741
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,330
嗨, 嘿 Manny...

00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,300
哇, 好一个晚上! 你们绝对猜不出我发生什么了
Wow, what a night! You'll never guess what happened to me..!

743
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,770
有人说你梦游了
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you were sleepwalking

744
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,410
噢, 不,不,不,我~
Oh, no, no, no. I was....

745
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,300
被一个部落的树懒绑架了
kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths..

746
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,320
我刚要这么猜呢
That was going to be my second guess!

747
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,850
但是他们很崇拜我
and they worship me...

748
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,580
我承认 他们把我扔到了火坑里
I mean sure, they tossed me into a flaming tar pit..

749
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,240
但是他们真的很崇拜我
but they worship me!!

750
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,720
Sid,你在做梦,快走
Sid, you were dreaming! Come on...

751
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,490
水长得比我们走的还快
The water's rising faster than we're moving!

752
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,440
告诉你们我是被绑架了
I'm telling you! I was kidnapped...

753
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,580
然后被崇拜,接着他们...

自己的决定...!

917
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,050
他的哥们儿们需要他!
His herd needs him!

918
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,370
他一直做为把粘合我们几个一起
He is the gooey, sticky, stuff that...

919
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:48,160
的那个粘乎乎,有粘性的东西

他使我们团结
He made this herd and...

还有没有他,我们什么都不是

我不是想要身体接触
That doesn't mean...want to touch...

我俩不再是最后两只猛犸了
We're not the last ones anymore!

927
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,220
你不来吗？
You're not coming?

928
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,650
你要和他们一起走吗？
You wanna go with them?

929
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,710
我是一只猛犸
I am a mammoth...

930
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:26,640
我也许该和另一只猛犸一起
I should probably be with a mammoth...

931
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,470
你不觉得吗？
don't you think?

932
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,120
对,可除非...
Yeah, unless...

除非什么？
Unless..

934

除非...我...
Unless..I...ah...

935
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,820
我只是想说...
I just wanna say..

936

希望你能找到所追求的一切

938
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,320
希望你也是

01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,960
从我们认识后,一起走了有很久了
You've come a long way since we met..

但是你得忘记过去
But you need to let go of the past...

Manny!

953
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:23,480
Ellie..
Ellie..

954
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,920
我不想因为生存需要才在一起
I don't want us to be together because we have to..

955
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:27,720
我希望我们
I want us...

956
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,310
在一起是因为我们希望如此

01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,820
而且我希望和你一起, Ellie!
And I wanna be with you, Ellie!

958

那么,你怎么觉得
So, what do you say?

959
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,750

我觉得你将要把...

961
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,270
你是我的好负鼠
You're possum enough for me!

962
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,280
好了,就剩我们俩了
Well, it's just you and me now...

963
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,760
两个单身汉
Two bachelors..

964
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,600
在荒野游荡
knocking about in the wild!

965
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,150
很好,但我不会驮负你的
Fine, but I'm not gonna carry you...!

966
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:08,620
这是我的自尊,知道吗?
I still have my pride, you know..

967
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,760
噢, 别这样 哥们儿,看在老情分上
Oh, come on, buddy. For old times sake?

968

但你的族群要走了

现在我们已经离开了
We are now!

01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,520
Manny, 谁你更喜欢？
Manny, who do you like better...?

972
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,520
我还是Diego?
Me or Diego?

Diego. 你差得很远
Diego. Not even close!

974

975
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,880
Manny! 你不能这么选小孩
Manny! You can't choose between your kids!!

976
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,770
他们不是我的小孩,宠物都不是
He's not my kid.  He's not even my dog!

977
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,910
如果我有宠物,宠物又有小孩

978

宠物的小孩又有宠物

979
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,520
那就可能是Sid了!
that would be Sid!

980
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,540
- 我能养只宠物吗 Manny? - 不行..
- Can I have a dog, Manny? - No..

981
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,620
Ellie, 我能养只宠物吗
Ellie, can I have a dog?

982
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,620
当然可以,亲爱的
Of course you can, sweetie!

983
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:46,850
Ellie....
Ellie....

984
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,740
我们得意见一致
We have to be consistent with them!!

985
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,800
我救了你,小兄弟!
I saved you, little buddy!!
