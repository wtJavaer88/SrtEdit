2
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,920
张开你的眼睛
From the day we arrive on the planet

3
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,990
看这世界
On the planet

4
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,010
你会发觉充满神奇
And,blinking,step into the sun

5
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,060
天上星星好像近在天边
There's more to see than can ever be seen

6
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,160
想要抓总是遥不可及
More to do than can ever be done

7
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,450
人生旅程坎坷不平
There's far too much to take in here

8
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,320
你要去体会它的真谛
More to find than can ever be found

9
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,630
尝尝人情冷暖
But the sun rolling high

10
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,170
或是体会世间的风险
Through the sapphire sky Keeps great and small on the endless round

11
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,100
没有办法逃避
On the endless round

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,250
看这世界在转
It's the circle of life

13
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,860
永远不停息
And it moves us all

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,130
尽管向前走
Through despair and hope

15
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,390
是对是错
Through faith and love

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,360
希望和失望
Till we find our place

17
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,550
世事没有绝对
On the path unwinding

18
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,360
看这世界
In the circle

19
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,180
是生生不息
The circle of life

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,970
世界正在转动
It's the circle of life

21
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,050
永远不停息
And it moves us all

22
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,450
黑夜与白昼
Through despair and hope

23
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,570
不停转动
Through faith and love

24
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,050
靠着阳光走
Till we find our place

25
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,060
慢慢你会知道
On the path unwinding

26
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,240
看这世界
In the circle

27
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,050
是生生不息
The circle of life

28
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,930
【 狮 子 王 】 【The Lion King】

29
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,450
生命真不公平啊！
Life's not fair,is it?

30
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,010
你看我呢，永远都当不上王
You see,I... Well,I shall never be king.

31
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,580
而你永远也见不到明天了
And you shall never see the light of another day.

32
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,550
再见
Adieu.

33
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,390
你妈妈没有教你 不要玩弄你的食物
Didn't your mother tell you not to play with your food?

34
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,350
你想干什么？
What do you want?

35
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,590
我是来这里宣布
I'm here to announce

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,880
大王木法沙要来了
that King Mufasa's on his way.

37
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,130
所以对你今天早上 没有出席那个仪式
So you'd better have a good excuse...

38
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,370
最好找个借口
for missing the ceremony this morning.

39
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,420
你害我的午餐都没了
Oh,now,look,Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.

40
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,990
等大王跟你算帐之后
Ha! You'll lose more than that...

41
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,390
你不见的东西还会更多
when the king gets through with you.

42
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,940
他就像只拉肚子的河马 一样愤怒
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

43
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,440
我怕得全身发抖
Ooh. I quiver with fear!

44
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,350
好了，刀疤，不要那样看我
Now,Scar,don't look at me that way.

45
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,680
救命啊！
Help!

46
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,780
刀疤，吐出来
Drop him.

47
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,290
你来得可真是时候，大王陛下
Impeccable timing,Your Majesty.

48
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,270
这不是我大哥吗？
Why,if it isn't my big brother...

49
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,280
屈尊降贵的 来跟我这普通人厮混
descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,350
我跟沙拉碧在辛巴的 介绍仪式中没有看到你
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.

51
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,930
那是今天吗？
That was today?

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,670
我觉得好害怕呀！
Oh,I feel simply awful!

53
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,810
我八成是给忘了
Must've slipped my mind.

54
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,520
是呀，你忘的不只如此
Yes,well,as slippery as your mind is...

55
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,440
身为大王的弟弟 你应该站在第一位
as the king's brother... you should've been first in line!

56
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,150
我原本是第一位 直到这个小毛球出生
Well,I was first in line... until the little hairball was born.

57
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,760
这个小毛球是我儿子
That hairball is my son...

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,760
他也是你未来的国王
and your future king.

59
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,090
我该学学我的礼节啦
Oh,I shall practice my curtsy.

60
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,180
千万不要背对着我，刀疤
Don't turn your back on me,Scar.

61
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,940
不，木法沙
Oh,no,Mufasa.

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,330
或许是你不该背对着我
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.

63
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,530
这是一个挑战吗？
Is that a challenge?

64
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,260
冷静！冷静！
Temper,temper.

65
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,010
我哪敢向大王你挑战呢？
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,070
可惜，为什么呢？
Pity. Why not?

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,820
要说脑袋的话 我是有狮子的智慧
As far as brains go,I got the lion's share.

68
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,670
说到蛮力嘛…
But when it comes to brute strength...

69
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,640
恐怕我就是基因遗传 比较不明显的例子了
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.

70
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,500
每个家庭都会有这个问题 陛下
There's one in every family,sire.

71
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,370
事实上我家有两个
Two in mine,actually...

72
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,280
而且他们总会想尽办法 破坏特别的场合
and they always manage to ruin special occasions.

73
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,370
我该拿他怎么办？
What am I going to do with him?

74
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,910
拿他做地毯会非常好看
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
沙祖
Zazu!

76
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
而且想一想
And just think,

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,980
每次弄脏的时候 你可以拿出去打一打
whenever he gets dirty... you could take him out and beat him.

78
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,470
爸，爸
Dad! Dad!

79
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,340
快起来，我们要走了啦！
Come on,Dad,we gotta go! Wake up!

80
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,880
对不起
Sorry.

81
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,210
爸…爸…
Dad. Dad.

82
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,220
你儿子已经醒了
Your son is awake.

83
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,650
在天亮前，他是你儿子
Before sunrise,he's your son.

84
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,930
爸…拜托啦！
Dad! Come on,Dad.

85
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,490
你答应过我的呀！
You promised.

86
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,420
好吧，好吧
- OK,OK.

87
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,970
我醒了，我醒了
I'm up,I'm up.

88
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,250
辛巴，你看
Look,Simba.

89
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,210
阳光所照到的一切 都是我们的国土
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

90
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,190
一个国王的统治 就跟太阳的起落是相同的
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.

91
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,470
总有一天，太阳将会 跟我一样慢慢下沉
One day,Simba,the sun will set on my time here...

92
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,540
并且在你当国王的时候 一同上升
and will rise with you as the new king.

93
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,240
这一切都是我的吗？ 所有的一切
- And this'll all be mine? - Everything.

94
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,650
阳光能照到的所有东西…
Everything the light touches.

95
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,750
那有阴影的地方呢？
What about that shadowy place?

96
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,740
那在我们的国度之外
That's beyond our borders.

97
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,010
你绝不可以去那个地方
You must never go there,Simba.

98
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,260
我以为国王可以随心所欲呀！
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.

99
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,320
你错了
There's more to being king...

100
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,600
国王也不能凡事随心所欲
than getting your way all the time.

101
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,750
不能吗？ 辛巴
- There's more? - Simba...

102
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,230
世界上所有的生命 都有他存在的价值
Everything you see exists together... in a delicate balance.

103
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,510
身为国王，你不但要了解
As king,you need to understand that balance...

104
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
还要去尊重所有的生活
and respect all the creatures...

105
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,350
包括爬行的蚂蚁和跳跃的羚羊
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.

106
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,240
但是，爸… 我们不是吃羚羊吗？
But,Dad,don't we eat the antelope?

107
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,080
是呀，我来跟你解释一下
Yes,Simba,but let me explain.

108
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,960
我们死后呢，尸体会成为草
When we die,our bodies become the grass...

109
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,740
而羚羊是吃草的
and the antelope eat the grass.

110
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,790
所以…
And so

111
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,900
在这个生命圈里面
we are all connected

112
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
都是互相有关联的
in the great circle of life.

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,110
早安，陛下
- Good morning,sire!

114
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,120
沙祖，你早
- Good morning,Zazu.

115
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,080
我来做早上的例行报告
Checking in with the morning report. Fire away.

116
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,860
你说吧 黑猩猩激动 而长颈鹿高高在上
Chimps are going ape,giraffes remain above it all

117
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,010
大象非常清楚我所忘记的事情
Elephants remember,though just what,I can't recall

118
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,850
鳄鱼爬到岸上咬住新鲜的猎物
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks

119
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,580
他向我展示巢里的蛋
Shown interest in my nest egg,

120
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
我说不客气
but I quickly said,no,thanks

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,160
我们没去看犀鸟 而秃鹰有第六感
We haven't paid the hornbills,and the vultures have a hunch

122
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,410
不是每个受邀的人 都会来吃午餐
Not everyone invited will be coming back from lunch

123
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,110
哈哈，这就是晨间报告
This is the morning report

124
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,500
大事小事不漏掉
Gives you the long and the short

125
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,490
每个呼吸微笑
Every grunt,roar,and snort

126
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,360
每个轻声吼叫
Not a tale I distort

127
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,710
都在晨间报告
On the morning report

128
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,180
儿子，你在干什么？  扑东西
- What are you doing,son? - Pouncing.

129
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,060
让个老手示范给你看看
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

130
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,660
今年草地肥美
Oh,the buffalo

131
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,630
水牛个个吃得强又壮 尽量的压低身子
have got a beef about...

132
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,430
豪猪受到阻挠 趴在地上
Stay low to the ground.

133
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,260
意图节省他毒气 趴在地上，好，我知道了
Yeah,OK. Stay low to the ground. Right.

134
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,070
…不停追逐文书鸟 别出声
Not a sound.

135
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,250
番红花是本季色彩 随处都可见
The season's colors seen in all the herds...

136
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,670
动一动行列纵队进行慢慢往下 慢慢来，向前一步
Take it slow. One more step...

137
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,950
…聚集在水肥处 然后…
- then... ...in the dung

138
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,860
这就是晨间报告
This is the morning report

139
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,920
大事小事不漏掉
Gives you the long and the short

140
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,970
每个呼吸微笑
Every grunt,roar,and snort

141
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,980
每个轻声吼叫
Not a tale I distort

142
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,710
都在晨间报告
On the morning report

143
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,480
哈…非常好 Ha …It is very good

144
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,810
沙祖 什么事呀？
- Zazu! - Yes!

145
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,230
地下传来的消息
Sir! News from the underground.

146
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,580
好，这一次呢…  陛下
Now,this time... Sire!

147
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,350
土狼到了荣耀石啦！
Hyenas in the pride lands!

148
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,840
沙祖，带辛巴回家
Zazu,take Simba home.

149
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,840
我不能去吗？
- Dad,can't I come?

150
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,810
不行，儿子
- No,son.

151
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,260
哼！什么地方都不准我去
I never get to go anywhere.

152
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,170
哦，小主人 将来你也会当国王的
Oh,young master,one day,you will be king.

153
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,590
然后你就可以随心所欲地 去追逐那些流着口水
Then you can chase those slobbering,mangy...

154
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,820
卑贱愚蠢的非法入侵者
stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.

155
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,940
嘿！刀疤叔叔，你猜怎样？
Hey,Uncle Scar! Guess what?

156
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,790
我最痛恨猜谜游戏了
I despise guessing games.

157
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,980
我将成为这里的国王耶
I'm gonna be king of Pride Rock.

158
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,920
哦！真好啊
Oh,goody.

159
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,310
我爸刚刚带我看了整个国度
My dad just showed me the whole kingdom...

160
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,770
而我将会统治一切
and I'm gonna rule it all.

161
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,220
是啊
Yes,well

162
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,380
哦！请原谅我没有高兴地跳起来
forgive me for not leaping for joy.

163
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,710
我的背不好你知道的
Bad back,you know.

164
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,870
嘿，刀疤叔叔
Hey,Uncle Scar,

165
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,100
如果我是国王 那你是什么？
when I'm king,what'll that make you?

166
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,330
你这猴子
A monkey's uncle.

167
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,110
你好奇怪哦！
You're so weird.

168
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,270
还有更怪的呢！
You have no idea.

169
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,470
哦！原来你爸爸带你 看过整个王国了，是吗？
So,your father showed you the whole kingdom,did he?

170
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,570
看过啦
Everything.

171
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,770
他没有带你到北方边界 太阳升起的地方吗？
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise... at the northern border?

172
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,830
没有
Well,no.

173
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,230
他说我不能去那里
He said I can't go there.

174
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,290
他说的完全正确
And he's absolutely right.

175
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,490
那里太危险了
It's far too dangerous.

176
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,070
只有勇敢的狮子才会去呀
Only the bravest lions go there.

177
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,850
我很勇敢啊  那有什么？
Well,I'm brave. What's out there?

178
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,690
对不起，辛巴 我就是不能告诉你
I'm sorry,Simba,I just can't tell you.

179
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:08,890
为什么？
Why not?

180
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,670
辛巴，辛巴
Simba,Simba,

181
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,610
我只是在为我 最喜欢的侄子着想
I'm only looking out... for the well-being of my favorite nephew.

182
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,450
没错，我是你唯一的侄子
Yeah,right. I'm your only nephew.

183
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,940
所以罗，我才更要保护你
All the more reason for me to be protective.

184
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,200
一个年轻的王子 不适合到大象墓园去的  哦！
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. oh

185
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,110
大象的什么？
An elephant what?

186
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,690
哇…
Whoa.

187
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,080
哦！天啊 我说的太多了
Oh,dear,I've said too much.

188
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,610
不过我猜你早晚总会发现的
Well,I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later...

189
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,580
你一直是这么样的聪明
you being so clever and all.

190
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,320
帮我个忙吧！
Oh,just do me one favor.

191
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,070
跟我保证你绝对 不会去那个可怕的地方
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.

192
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,190
没问题
- No problem.

193
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,270
这才是乖孩子
- There's a good lad.

194
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,660
你现在自己出去玩吧
You run along now and have fun.

195
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,330
并且记得哦…
And remember,

196
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,540
这是我们的小秘密
it's our little secret.

197
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,740
嘿！娜娜  嗨！辛巴
- Hey, - Hi,Simba.

198
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,580
走吧 我刚才听到一个很棒的地方
Come on. I just heard about this great place.

199
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,170
辛巴，我现在正在洗澡啊
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.

200
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,780
你也该洗澡罗
And it's time for yours.

201
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,370
妈…
Mom!

202
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,250
妈…你把我的毛弄乱了啦
Mom,you're messing up my mane!

203
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,280
好了！好了
OK,

204
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,990
我干净了 我们可以走了吗？
I'm clean. Can we go now?

205
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,250
我们要到哪里去呀？
So,where are we going?

206
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,890
最好不要什么烂地方
It better not be anyplace dumb.

207
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,840
不！那真的很酷耶
No,it's really cool.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,620
这个很酷的地方是在哪里呢？
So,where is this really cool place?

209
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,140
就在水洞附近
Oh. Around the water hole.

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,260
水洞附近？
The water hole?

211
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,140
水洞附近有什么了不起的啊？
What's so great about the water hole?

212
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,400
等到了那里我再告诉你
I'll show you when we get there.

213
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,590
哦
Oh.

214
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,440
妈，我能去吗？
Mom,can I go with Simba?

215
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,730
沙拉碧你说呢？  这个嘛…
Hmm,what do you think,Sarabi? Well...

216
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,710
拜托…
- Please? - Please?

217
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,350
我是没什么意见
It's all right with me.

218
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,640
哦，耶…
- All right! - Yeah!

219
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,620
不过要沙祖跟你们一起去
As long as Zazu goes with you.

220
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,320
不…不要沙祖
No,not Zazu.

221
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,720
开心一点嘛
Step lively.

222
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,010
越快到水洞 我们就可以越快回家
The sooner we get to the water hole the sooner we can leave.

223
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,690
我们到底要去哪里呀？
So,where are we really going?

224
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,800
一个大象的墓园  哇！
- An elephant graveyard. - Wow!

225
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,700
嘘…沙祖
Shh! Zazu.

226
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,150
对了 我们要怎么摆脱那个笨蛋呀？
Right. So how are we gonna ditch the dodo?

227
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,970
哦！看看你们俩个 再去大象的墓园
Oh,just look at you two.

228
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,130
大草原上一段 小小的罗曼史正在孕育
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna.

229
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,660
你们的父母会很高兴的
Your parents will be thrilled...

230
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,660
等到你们订婚之后 还有…  什么？
what with your being betrothed and all. - Be... what?

231
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,630
准备成婚 订下婚约、海誓山盟
- Betrothed. Intended. Affianced.

232
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,500
意思是…
Meaning...?

233
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,600
有一天你们俩个会结婚
One day,you two are going to be married.

234
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,060
我不能娶她耶
I can't marry her.

235
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,160
她是我的朋友
She's my friend.

236
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,060
对，那实在太奇怪了
Yeah,it'd be so weird.

237
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,160
很抱歉，破坏你们的美梦
Sorry to bust your bubble...

238
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,870
但是你们俩个小朋友别无选择
but you two turtledoves have no choice.

239
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,070
这是流传了好几世代的传统
It's a tradition going back generations.

240
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,650
等我当国王 第一就是废除这件事
When I'm king,that'll be the first thing to go.

241
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,820
只要有我在就不准
- Not so long as I'm around. .

242
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,630
哦，那你被开除了
- In that case,you're fired

243
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,920
很聪明 但只有国王才能开除我
Hmm. Nice try,but only the king can do that.

244
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,730
可是他是未来的国王啊
Well,he's the future king.

245
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,060
对！所以我说什么你都得听
Yeah,so you have to do what I tell you.

246
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,700
嘿嘿！现在还不必听
Not yet,I don't. .

247
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,160
而且由你这种态度
And with an attitude like that..

248
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,970
恐怕你以后会变成 一个相当悲惨的国王
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be... a pretty pathetic king indeed.

249
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,880
哼！我看才不会呢
Hmm. Not the way I see it.

250
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,300
我将会是万兽之王
I'm gonna be a mighty king,

251
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,380
瞧瞧我的模样
so enemies beware

252
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,860
从来没有一个狮子王 他的毛会那么少
Well,I've never seen a king of beasts With quite so little hair

253
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,100
来看看我的威严 没有人比得过
I'm gonna be the main event like no king was before

254
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,940
没有人敢说“不要啦” 只要我说声“要”
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down I'm workin' on my roar

255
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,340
从来没见过像你那么糟
Thus far,a rather uninspiring thing.

256
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,400
等不及成为狮子王
Oh,I just can't wait to be king

257
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,280
你还有很长的路要走呢 小主人
You've rather a long way to go,young master,if you think...

258
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,310
如果你以为…
- No one sayin',

259
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,500
没有任何吩咐  我那么说的时候…
"Do this" - Now,when I said that...

260
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,410
没有任何束缚
- No one saying,"Be there"

261
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,830
我的意思是…
- What I meant was...

262
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,200
没有任何坏处
- No one sayin',"Stop that"

263
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
总会有你好处  听我说…
- But what you don't realize... - No one sayin',"See here"

264
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,750
自由自在到处跑
Free to run around all day

265
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,950
绝对不是那样的
Well,that's definitely out.

266
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,150
做错事情也没人吵
Free to do it all my way

267
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,480
找个时间该坐下来 来好好谈一谈
I think it's time that you and I Arranged a heart-to-heart

268
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,360
别浪费唇舌 是建议一律都免谈
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start

269
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,390
如果你真的这样统治 我想那就惨
If this is where the monarchy is headed,count me out

270
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,890
干脆离开这块烂地方
Out of service,out of Africa,

271
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,470
我再也不想管
I wouldn't hang about

272
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,050
这小孩已经开始嫌我烦
This child is getting wildly out of wing

273
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,360
等不及成为狮子王
Oh,I just can't wait to be king

274
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,120
所有人往左看
Everybody,look left

275
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,800
所有人往右看
Everybody,look right

276
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,220
所有人往这看
Everywhere you look,

277
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,000
我在你们中间
I'm standing in the spotlight

278
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,490
还早呢！
Not yet!

279
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,330
让所有万物都一起歌唱
Let every creature go for broke and sing

280
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,530
让我们随他脚步到处闯
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing

281
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,350
让所有万物都一起颂赞
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

282
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:56,010
等不及成为狮子王…
Oh,I just can't wait to be king

283
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,550
对不起，夫人
I beg your pardon,madam,

284
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,160
您坐在我的身上了
but...

285
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,750
请让一让
get off!

286
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,590
辛巴
simba

287
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,650
娜娜…
Nala.....

288
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,730
好啦！成功了  摆脱他了吧
All right! It worked! - We lost him.

289
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,700
我…是个天才
- I am a genius.

290
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,960
嘿！天才 那是我的主意
Hey,genius,it was my idea.

291
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,120
没错啊 但是，是我执行的啊  还有我
Yeah,but I pulled it off. - With me!

292
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,000
哦，是吗？
- Oh,yeah?

293
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,290
输了吧
- Pinned ya.

294
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,260
让我起来
- Hey,let me up.

295
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,400
你又输了吧
Pinned ya again.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,230
就是这里 我们成功了
This is it. We made it.

297
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,500
哇…
woo

298
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,090
这里阴森森的
It's really creepy.

299
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,580
是啊，不是很棒吗？
Yeah. Isn't it great?

300
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,130
我们可能会有大麻烦
- We could get in big trouble.

301
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,450
我知道
I know

302
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,580
不知道他的脑袋还在不在哪儿？
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

303
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,230
只有一个办法能知道
There's only one way to know.

304
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,240
走吧，我们去看看 不对
Come on,let's go check it out. Wrong!

305
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,040
你们唯一该做的事情 就是立刻离开这里
The only checking out you will do... will be to check out of here.

306
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,790
烦耶！
Oh,man!

307
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,720
我们已经超出 荣耀石的范围太远了
We're way beyond the boundary of the pride lands.

308
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,540
你看 那个尖嘴老头害怕了
Look,Banana Beak is scared.

309
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,640
不管我是不是尖嘴小老头  小毛球
It's Mr. Banana Beak to you, fuzzy...

310
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,510
我告诉你 我们的处境真的是很危险
and right now we are all in very real danger.

311
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,390
危险？哈哈…
Danger? Ha!

312
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,330
我在荒野中行走
I walk on the wide side.

313
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,330
我会当面嘲笑危险
I laugh in the face of danger.

314
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:50,890
哈哈哈哈…  哇哇哇…
Well,well,well, Well,well,well,

315
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,760
斑仔
Banzai,

316
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,700
看看这是什么？
what have we got here?

317
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,260
桑琪，我不知道
Hmm. I don't know,Shenzi.

318
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,580
阿德，你觉得呢？
What do you think,Ed?

319
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,650
哈…
ha

320
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,490
对！就如我刚刚在想
Just what I was thinking.

321
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,270
三个违规的家伙
A trio of trespassers!

322
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,590
这完全是个意外！
And quite by accident,

323
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,790
我跟你们保证 这只是航行上的小小的错误
let me assure you. A simple navigational error.

324
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,010
等等…
Whoa,whoa,wait,wait,wait.

325
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,220
我认识你 你是木法沙的小跟班
I know you. You're Mufasa's little stooge.

326
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,580
夫人 我是国王陛下的总管
I,madam,am the king's major-domo.

327
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,520
这么说你就是…
- And that would make you...

328
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,620
未来的国王
- The future king.

329
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,940
你知道我们是怎么对付 超出自己国界的国王吗？
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?

330
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,750
你们也不能把我怎么样啊！
You can't do anything to me.

331
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,050
理论上可以 我们在他们的土地上
Technically,they can. We are on their land.

332
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,410
可是沙祖你跟我说 他们只是爱流口水的傻瓜啊！
But,Zazu,you told me they're nothin'... but slobbering,mangy,stupid poachers.

333
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,020
能不能不要再提 傻瓜这两个字？
- Lx-nay on the upid-stay.

334
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,700
嘿！你叫谁是傻瓜？
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?

335
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,930
停…你看那个太阳 我该走了
My,my,my. Look at the sun! It's time to go!

336
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,060
急什么？ 我们很乐意你留下来晚餐  是呀…
What's the hurry? We'd love you to stick around for dinner. Yeah,

337
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,000
我们可以吃… 狮子大餐呀！
we could have whatever's lion around!

338
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,360
哈…
ha...

339
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,690
等等… 有了，有了，有了
Wait,wait,wait,I got one,I got one!

340
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,110
我要一份幼狮三明治 你觉得呢？
Make mine a cub sandwich! What'd you think?

341
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
哈…
ha..

342
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,430
什么？阿德？
What,Ed?

343
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,660
什么？
What is it?

344
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,310
我们订的晚餐要外带吗？
Hey,did we order this dinner to go?

345
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,960
没有啊！怎么啦？
- No,why?

346
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,120
因为他们跑了
- 'Cause there it goes!

347
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,940
我们甩掉他们了吗？
- Did we lose 'em?

348
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,430
我想是的
- I think so.

349
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,790
沙祖在哪？
Where's Zazu?

350
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,530
原来我们的小总管 一路赶着想做只白煮鸟
The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped... all the way to the birdie-boiler.

351
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,310
不！我不要做白煮鸟！
Oh,no! Not the birdie-boiler!

352
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,390
嘿！你们为什么不去找一个 跟你们差不多大的
Hey,why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

353
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,680
像…你吗？
- Like you?

354
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,740
哦哦！
- Oops.

355
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,160
辛巴
simba

356
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,930
快来呀！小宝贝
Here,kitty,kitty,kitty.

357
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,320
哈哈…就这样吗？
That was it?

358
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,270
再吼一次，来呀！
Do it again. Come on.

359
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,380
大…大哥
Oh,please,please!

360
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,420
误会…误会  闭嘴！
Uncle,uncle! - Silence!

361
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,250
闭嘴！我们都闭嘴
- Silence!- We're gonna shut up right now!

362
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,160
别激动 我们真的很抱歉
Calm down. We're really sorry.

363
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,490
如果你们敢再靠近我儿子
If you ever come near my son again...

364
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,300
这位…这位是您的…
Oh,this is your son?

365
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,690
哦！是您的公子啊  你知道吗？
- Oh,your son? - Did you know that?

366
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,490
不，我不知道
No. Me? I didn't know...

367
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,920
这个… 你…你知道吗？
No,did you?

368
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,310
不，当然不知道
- No,of course not. - No.

369
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,280
不！阿德？
- Ed? - Ed?

370
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,350
溜
Toodles.

371
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,380
爸，我…
Dad,l...

372
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,320
你故意违抗我的命令
You deliberately disobeyed me.

373
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,770
爸，我很抱歉
- Dad,I'm sorry.

374
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,130
跟我回家去
- Let's go home.

375
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,130
我认为你非常勇敢
I thought you were very brave.

376
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,820
沙祖
Zazu

377
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,860
是的，陛下
- Yes,sire?

378
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,090
带娜娜回家
- Take Nala home.

379
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,740
我必须要给我儿子上一课
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

380
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,170
娜娜，走吧
Come,Nala.

381
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,180
辛巴，唉！
Simba,

382
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,400
祝你好运
good luck.

383
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,960
辛巴
Simba

384
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,460
辛巴，我对你非常失望
Simba,I'm very disappointed in you.

385
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,710
我知道
- I know.

386
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,940
你可能会死掉
- You could've been killed.

387
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,720
你故意违抗我的命令
You deliberately disobeyed me...

388
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,760
而且更糟的是
and what's worse,

389
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,700
你和娜娜有生命危险
you put Nala in danger.

390
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,180
我只是想要跟你一样勇敢
I was just trying to be brave,like you.

391
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,480
我只有在必要的时候才勇敢
I'm only brave when I have to be.

392
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,770
辛巴
Simba,being brave...

393
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,940
勇敢并不表示你要去找麻烦
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

394
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,170
可是你好像什么都不怕
But you're not scared of anything.

395
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,070
我今天就怕了  真的？
I was today. - You were?

396
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,980
是的
- Yes.

397
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,470
我怕我会失去你
I thought I might lose you.

398
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,120
噢…原来国王也会害怕
Oh. I guess even kings get scared,huh?

399
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,100
但是你知道吗？  什么？
- But you know what? - What?

400
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,000
我认为那些土狼比你还害怕
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

401
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,330
哈…
ha...

402
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,550
因为没有人有胆子敢惹你爸爸  过来
'Cause nobody messes with your dad. - Come here,you.

403
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,360
不要，不要
- Oh,no! No!

404
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,050
放手啦！
Come here!

405
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,720
来呀！
Gotcha!

406
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,250
爸  嗯
- Dad? - Hmm?

407
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,060
我们是不是伙伴
- We're pals,right?

408
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,970
对
- Right.

409
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,330
那我们就永远在一起，对吧
And we'll always be together,right?

410
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,180
辛巴
Simba,

411
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,520
我告诉你一些 我爸爸以前跟我说的话
let me tell you something... that my father told me.

412
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,290
你看那些星星
Look at the stars.

413
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,620
过去那些伟大的君王
The great kings of the past...

414
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,110
从那些星星上看着我们
Iook down on us from those stars.

415
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,230
真的？
- Really?

416
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,590
是呀
- Yes.

417
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,950
所以每当你寂寞的时候
So,whenever you feel alone...

418
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,630
要记得那些君王 永远在那里指引着你
just remember that those kings... will always be there to guide you...

419
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,380
还有我也是
and so will I.

420
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,550
木法沙真差劲
Man,that lousy Mufasa.

421
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,200
害我一个星期都不能坐
I won't be able to sit for a week.

422
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,340
这个不好笑，阿德
It's not funny,Ed.

423
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,740
闭嘴！
Hey,shut up!

424
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,230
你们安静一点好不好？
Will you knock it off?

425
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,560
是他先开始的
Well,he started it.

426
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,880
看看你们俩个
Look at you guys.

427
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,340
难怪我们会在 食物链最底部晃荡
No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.

428
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,860
我痛恨晃荡  废话！
Man,I hate dangling. Yeah? .

429
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,630
如果不是那些狮子 这地方早就是我们的了
You know,if it weren't for those lions..

430
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,190
我痛恨狮子！
we'd be runnin' the joint. Man,I hate lions.

431
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,030
那么顽固
- So pushy. - And hairy.

432
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,900
又毛茸茸的
- And stinky.

433
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,710
而且又臭  还有老天他们…
- And,man,are they...

434
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,170
丑死了
- Ugly! - Ugly!

435
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,310
我们狮子当然 不全都是那么糟糕的
Oh,surely,we lions are not all that bad.

436
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,150
刀疤，原来是你
Oh,Scar. It's just you.

437
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,120
我们还以为是什么大人物呢！
We were afraid it was somebody important.

438
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,270
对呀，就像木法沙  是呀
Yeah,you know,like Mufasa. - Yeah.

439
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,090
是吗？
- I see.

440
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,900
那才叫力量
- Now,that's power.

441
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,160
一点也没错 光听他的名字我就会发抖
- Tell me about it. I just hear that name,and I shudder.

442
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,830
木法沙  再来一次
- Mufasa! - Ooh! Do it again.

443
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,680
木法沙
- Mufasa!

444
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,460
木法沙…
- Mufasa!

445
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,430
真过瘾
Ooh,it tingles me.

446
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,560
我身边全是一些白痴  得了吧，刀疤
I'm surrounded by idiots. Now,you,Scar,

447
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,400
你是我们的一份子
I mean,you're one of us.

448
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,270
别忘了你是我们的伙伴
- I mean,you're our pal.

449
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,820
真感人…
- Charmed.

450
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
噢，我喜欢
Oh,I like that.

451
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,060
他不是国王 但他还是那么有威严
He's not king,but he's still so proper.

452
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,160
是呀，刀疤
yes,Scar

453
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,280
你带什么给我们吃的
Did you bring us anything to eat, Scar,old buddy?

454
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,130
嘿，老伙伴，好兄弟
Did ya,did ya,did ya?

455
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,070
有没有，有没有
I don't think you really deserve this.

456
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,320
我认为你们实在不值得
I do not think you is really worth

457
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,390
我是特别把那些小狮子 送来给你们的
I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you...

458
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,080
而你们却让他给跑掉了
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

459
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,570
可是你知道
You know,

460
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,540
他们并不是 自己单独来的，刀疤
it wasn't exactly like they was alone,Scar.

461
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,350
对呀！我们该怎么做呢？
Yeah. What were we supposed to do,

462
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,870
杀了木法沙？
kill Mufasa?

463
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,170
一点也没错
Precisely.

464
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,830
不要在我面前耍威风
I know that your powers of retention

465
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,580
仔细看 像个饭桶不中用
Are as wet as a warthog's backside

466
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,640
你给我站好 仔细听着
But thick as you are

467
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,330
我的话已经够明白
Pay attention

468
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,040
那是所谓无言的表白
My words are a matter of pride

469
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,800
这地方由我来主宰
It's clear from your vacant expressions

470
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,290
难道你们都没有发现
The lights are not all on upstairs

471
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,380
王位继承权在我手中
But we're talking kings and successions

472
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,040
准备好你的心静静等候
Even you can't be caught unawares So prepare for the chance of a lifetime

473
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,490
迎接这一个天大消息
Be prepared for sensational news

474
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,300
一个新的时代它悄悄要到来
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer

475
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,170
那我们又算什么？
And where do we feature?

476
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,780
不管我多恶毒
Just listen to teacher

477
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,850
只要听我吩咐 不要再犯错误
I know it sounds sordid But you'll be rewarded

478
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,220
以后总会有你的好处
When at last I am given my dues

479
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,930
我要大声地向你宣布
And injustice deliciously squared

480
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,100
快准备

481
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,650

483
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,110
准备木法沙王之死！
- For the death of the king.

484
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,660
怎么了？他病了？ 不
- Why,is he sick? - No,

485
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,370
笨蛋！我们要杀了他 还有辛巴
fool,we're going to kill him... and Simba,too.

486
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,440
好主意 谁需要国王啊！
Great idea. Who needs a king?

487
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,860
不要王…
No king,no king, la-la la-la la la

488
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,830
啦…  白痴！还会有另外一个王的
Idiots! There will be a king!

489
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,840
但是你自己说…
- Hey,but you said...

490
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,130
我将要做你们的王
- I will be king!

你们就再也不会饿肚子了
and you'll never go hungry again.

493
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,630
好耶！
- Yeah! - Yeah! All right!

494
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,030

国王万岁！
- Long live the king!

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,360
国王万岁！
- Long live the king!

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,910
看来很快就会有依靠
It's great that we'll soon be connected

498
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,950
随时随地伺候你左右
With a king who'll be all-time adored

499
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,530
要投靠我，不要怀疑
Of course,quid pro quo,you're expected

500
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,380
保证大家都会好过
To take certain duties on board

501
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,680
看来未来是充满着希望
The future is littered with prizes

502
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,430
保证过就不会泡汤
And though I'm the main addressee

503
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,790
让我再一次向你提醒
The point that I must emphasize is

504
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,530

不能抵抗 又雄壮威严受尊敬的我
Is simply why I'll be king undisputed Respected,saluted

511
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,010
就是森林之王
And seen for the wonder I am

512
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,730
因为我要的理想更高

好，你在这等着
Now,you wait here.

你爸爸为你准备了一个大惊喜
Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.

518
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,890
什么惊喜？
Ooh,what is it?

519
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,700
如果我告诉你的话 那就不叫惊喜了，对不对
If I told you,it wouldn't be a surprise,now,would it?

520
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,870
如果你告诉我 我会装得很惊讶
If you tell me,I'll still act surprised.

521
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,680
你实在是非常的调皮
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.

522
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,230
说嘛！刀疤叔叔
- Come on,Uncle Scar.

523
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,940
不…
- No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

524
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,400
这是你爸爸跟你之间的事情
This is just for you and your daddy.

525
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,080
是那种父子之间的…关系
You know,a sort of father-son... thing.

526
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,440
好了，我最好去找他去  我跟你一起去
Well,I better go get him. - I'll go with you.

527
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,250
不！
- No!

528
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,520
不…你只管待在这个石块上
No. Just stay on this rock.

529
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,060
你不会想像上次那样 再遇到土狼吧？
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess... like you did with the hyenas.

530
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,430
你知道那件事呀？
You know about that?

531
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,950
辛巴，每个人都知道那件事   真的吗？
Simba,everybody knows about that. - Really?

532
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,980
是啊，算你幸运
- Oh,yes.Lucky

533
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,930
爸爸赶去救你了，对不对啊？
Daddy was there to save you,eh?

534
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,190
这是我们的小秘密
Oh,and just between us...

535
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,350
你是不是该练习练习 你的吼叫声了呢？
you might want to work on that little roar of yours.

536
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,030
哦，好吧
Oh,OK.

537
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,620
嘿！刀疤叔叔
Hey,Uncle Scar

538
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,590
我会喜欢那个惊喜吗？
will I like this surprise?

539
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,340
辛巴，你会喜欢死的
Simba,it's to die for.

540
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,560
闭嘴！
- Shut up.

541
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,270
我也没办法 我肚子好饿
- I can't help it.I'm so hungry.

542
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,250
我可以吃下一头野牛
I got to have a wildebeest.

543
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,410
不要乱动 拜托！
Stay put. Please

544
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,220
我可不可以 吃一头生病的就好了
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?

545
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,260
不行！我们要等待刀疤的讯号
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

546
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,460
他在那边
There he is.

547
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,750
我们走
Let's go.

548
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,820
吼叫声
Little roar.

549
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
陛下，你看！ 有东西在移动   奇怪？
Oh,look,sire,the herd is on the move. - Odd.

550
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,270
木法沙！快点 动物逃窜
- Mufasa,quick!

551
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,340
在峡谷那儿 而辛巴也在
Stampede in the gorge. - Simba's down there.

552
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,950
辛巴？
- Simba?

553
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,280
沙祖！救我
Zazu,help me!

554
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,600
你爸爸已经来了  撑着点
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

555
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,540
快呀…
Hurry!

556
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,070
那边，在那儿
There,on that tree.

557
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,390
在那树上
Hold on,Simba!

558
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,300
捉好，辛巴
Oh,Scar,

559
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,440
刀疤，这太可怕了  我们该怎么办？
this is awful! What'll we do?

560
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,210
我该做些什么？
I'll go back to help,

561
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,770
我回去搬救兵
that's what I'll do.

562
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,320
我就这么做 我去搬救…
I'll go back...

563
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,600
爸…
Dad!

564
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,830
刀疤…
Scar

565
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,160
弟弟，救救我
Brother! Help me!

566
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,820
愿国王万岁
Long live the king.

567
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,290
不…
No..

568
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,620
爸…
Dad!

569
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,870
爸
Dad!

570
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,790
爸
Dad!

571
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,800
爸，起来
Dad,come on.

572
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,390
你一定要起来
You got to get up.

573
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,360
爸…
Dad?

574
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,240
跟我回家啦
We got to go home.

575
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,670
救命啊…
Help!

576
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,590
有没有人？
Somebody!

577
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,320
任何人…
Anybody.

578
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,010
救命
Help.

579
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,320
辛巴
Simba,

580
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,900
看你弄得…
what have you done?

581
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,100
有好多动物 他想救我
There were wildebeests,and he tried to save me.

582
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,430
这真的是意外 我不是故意的
It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen.

583
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,660
当然，你当然不是故意的
Of course,of course you didn't.

584
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,440
没有人会故意 要让这种事发生的
No one ever means for these things to happen...

585
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,410
但是国王已经死了
but the king is dead.

586
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,610
而且，如果不是因为你 他现在还会活着的
And if it weren't for you,he'd still be alive.

587
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,980
你妈妈会怎么想呢？
Oh,what will your mother think?

588
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,270
那我该怎么办？
What am I going to do?

589
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,010
跑的远远的，辛巴  快跑
Run away,Simba. Run.

590
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,820
跑的远远的再也不要回来了
Run away and never return.

591
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,880
杀了他
Kill him.

592
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,830
他在那边 往那边跑了
Hey,there he goes. There he goes.

593
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,950
那就快追呀
So,go get him.

594
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,700
我才不愿意到那边去呢！  怎么？
There ain't no way I'm going in there. What,

595
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,480
你想要我跟你一样 变成个仙人掌啊？
you want me to come out looking like you,cactus butt?

596
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,870
我们一定得完成任务
But we got to finish the job.

597
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,880
唉！反正他出去以后 就完蛋定了
Well,he's as good as dead out there anyway.

598
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,270
如果他回来的话 我们再杀他
And if he comes back,we'll kill him.

599
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,080
对！你听到没有？
Yeah! You hear that?

600
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,080
如果你敢回来 我们就杀了你
If you ever come back,we'll kill you!

601
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,840
木法沙的死亡是个可怕的悲剧
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy...

602
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,960
但是辛巴几乎才开始他的生命 竟然也…
but to lose Simba,who had barely begun to live...

603
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,680
对我来说 这是一个极大的个人损失
for me,it is a deep,personal loss.

604
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,620
我在极悲恸的心情下登上王位
So,it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.

605
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,720
但是我们 必须振作起来忘掉悲痛
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy...

606
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,990
共同迎接一个崭新时代的来临
we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era...

607
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:35,850
我们狮子将跟土狼 一起走向光明伟大的未来
in which lion and hyena come together... in a great and glorious future.

608
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,200
走开…走开 快走开
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

609
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,080
我喜欢赶走秃鹰
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

610
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,540
每次都成功
Gets 'em every time.

611
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,870
丁满，你最好过来看看
Uh-oh. Hey,Timon,you better come look.

612
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,840
我看他好像还活着
I think it's still alive.

613
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,390
哎哟！这什么东西呀？
All righty,what have we got here?

614
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,470
天啊！是只狮子
Jeez,it's a lion!

615
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,990
彭彭，快跑
Run,Pumbaa,move it!

616
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,120
丁满，他只是只小狮子
Hey,Timon,it's just a little lion.

617
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,770
你看他那么可爱
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

618
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,300
而且是一个人 我们能留下他吗？
- Can we keep him?

619
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,850
彭彭，你疯了吗？
- Pumbaa,are you nuts?

620
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,230
躺在这儿的是只狮子
You're talking about a lion.

621
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,590
狮子就是专门吃我们的  但是他还那么小
Lions eat guys like us. - But he's so little.

622
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,330
他以后会长大的
- He's going to get bigger.

623
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,590
也许他会变得跟我们一国
Maybe he'll be on our side.

624
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,500
这是我听过最蠢的话了
Ha! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

625
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,610
或许他会…
maye be

626
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,440
咦…我有点子了
Hey,I got it.

627
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,120
如果他跟我们一国
What if he's on our side?

628
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,130
有只狮子在身边或许蛮不错的
You know,having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.

629
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,650
那我们就留下他罗
So,we're keeping him?

630
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,360
当然，这里是谁做主啊？
Of course. Who's the brains of this outfit?

631
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,520
我认为他应该留下
My point exactly.

632
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,560
哎哟！天啊！我热死了
Jeez,I'm fried.

633
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:24,140
我们快离开这儿 找个阴凉的地方
Let's get out of here and find some shade.

634
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,060
你还好吧？孩子  我想是吧
- You OK,kid? - I guess so.

635
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,960
你差点就死了
- You nearly died.

636
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,930
我救了你
- I saved you.

637
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,030
彭彭也帮了…一滴滴忙
Well,Pumbaa helped... a little.

638
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,490
谢谢你们帮忙
Thanks for your help.

639
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,170
你要去哪里？
- Hey,where you going?

640
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,490
不知道
- Nowhere.

641
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,920
他看起来很BLUE
Gee,he looks blue.

642
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,920
我倒觉得是金黄色
I'd say brownish gold.

643
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,080
不，我是说…沮丧
No,no,no. I mean he's depressed.

644
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,700
孩子你在烦什么？
Kid,what's eating you?

645
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,580
烦？狮子可是万兽之王
Nothing. He's at the top of the food chain.

646
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,590
烦个屁呀！
The food chain.

647
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,130
那你从哪儿来的？
So,where you from?

648
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,700
谁在乎？我又不能回去
Who cares? I can't go back.

649
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,850
你是被扫地出门的
Ah,you're an outcast.

650
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,340
好极了！我们也是
- That's great. So are we.

651
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,530
你做了什么事？
- What'd you do,kid?

652
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,280
很可怕的事 但是我不想跟你们说
Something terrible,but I don't want to talk about it.

653
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,770
很好，我们也不想听
Good. We don't want to hear about it.

654
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,030
拜托，丁满 我们能帮忙吗？
Come on,Timon. Anything we can do?

655
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,640
除非你们能够改变历史
Not unless you can change the past.

656
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,910
孩子你要知道在这个时候 我这位伙伴丁满说
Kid,in times like this,my buddy Timon here says...

657
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,490
你必须把你的背后抛到过去
you got to put your behind in your past.

658
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,100
不…
- No,no,no.

659
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,430
我是说… 笨蛋
Amateur. - I mean...

660
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,930
能不能闭上你的乌鸦嘴呀
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

661
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,800
是…你必须把过去抛到脑后
It's,you got to put your past behind you.

662
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,800
孩子 你常会碰到一些倒霉的事
Look,kid,bad things happen...

663
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,510
而你却拿它没办法，对吧？
and you can't do anything about it,right?

664
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,670
对 错
- Right. - Wrong!

665
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,390
当这个世界遗弃你的时候
When the world turns its back on you...

666
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,000
你就去遗弃这个世界
you turn your back on the world.

667
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,950
我以前学的不是这样
Well,that's not what I was taught.

668
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,170
那么你或许应该学点新知识
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

669
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,270
跟着我一起念
Repeat after me.

是我们的座右铭  什么是座右铭？
- Yeah. It's our motto. - What's a motto?

685
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,780
管它呢？跟着念就行了
Nothing. What's a motto with you?

686
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,450

You know,kid,

687

这几个字能够解决 你所有的问题
these two words will solve all your problems.

688

当他是只小山猪
When he was a young warthog

692
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,500
谢啦
- Thanks.

693
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,760
看他好像魅力十足风度翩翩
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal

694
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,640
看来看去好像缺少一些东西
He could clear the savanna after every meal

695
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,730
虽然我长得丑
I'm a sensitive soul

696
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,350
可是很温柔
Though I seem thick skinned

697
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:03,170
我终于发现我没办法出人头地
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind

698
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,620
真丢脸
- And,oh,the shame

699
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,940
太丢脸罗
- He was ashamed

700
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,130
我想过改名字
- Thought of changing my name

701
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,460
改什么名字？
- Oh,what's in a name?

702
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,980
我终于放弃
- And I got downhearted

703
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:10,920
为什么？
- How did you feel?

704
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,310
每次我想…
Every time that l...

705
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,950
彭彭，不要在小孩面前…
Hey,Pumbaa,not in front of the kids.

706
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,590
对不起

好饿
I'm starved.

723
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,450
我肚子饿得可以 吃下一匹斑马了
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

724
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,940
我们这里没有新鲜斑马肉
Ah,we're fresh out of zebra.

725
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,940
那有羚羊吗？
- Any antelope?

726
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,710
没有
- Nuh-uh.

727
00:44:58,850 --> 00:44:59,490
河马呢？
- Hippo?

如果你跟我们住 就得跟我们吃的一样
if you live with us,you have to eat like us.

731
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,880
这里像是可以弄到 昆虫的好地方
This looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub.

732
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:08,470
那是什么？
Ew,what's that?

733
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,280

A grub. What's it look like?

734
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,990
哦…好恶心
Ew,gross.

735
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,700
吃起来像鸡肉
Mmm. Tastes like chicken.

00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,090
没…
- Oh,nothing.

770
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,090
你知道规矩的
You know the law.

771
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,190
在我面前绝对不准提那个名字
Never ever mention that name in my presence.

772
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,450
因为我是国王
I am the king!

773
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,060
是的，陛下
Yes,sire,

774
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,190
你是国王
you are the king.

775
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,420
我会提起他只是在比较
I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences...

776
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,750
你们在经营管理方面的差异之处
in your royal managerial approaches.

777
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,560
老大
- Hey,boss.

778
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,620
哎哟！又有什么事？
- Oh,what is it this time?

779
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,630
我们有一件事要跟你抱怨一下
We got a bone to pick with you.

780
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,020
让我来说吧
I'll handle this.

781
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,920
刀疤
Scar,

782
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,500
已经没有食物也没有水了
there's no food,no water.

783
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,280
对呀
Yeah.

784
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,220
晚餐时间到了 我们连主菜都没有
It's dinnertime,and we ain't got no stinking entrees.

785
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:04,580
狩猎的工作不是由狮子来负责的吗？
It's the lioness's job to do the hunting.

786
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,550
他们不肯去呀
- Yeah,but they won't go hunt.

787
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,250
那吃沙祖吧
- Oh,eat Zazu.

788
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,420
你们不会爱吃的
Oh,you wouldn't want me.

789
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,650
我的肉又硬、味道又骚
I'd be so tough and

790
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,450
而且恶心
gamy and...

791
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,430
沙祖，不用说笑了
Oh,Zazu,don't be ridiculous.

792
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,910
你只需要加点调味料
All you need is a little dung.

793
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,850
我以前以为木法沙实在不好过
I thought things were bad under Mufasa.

794
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,690
你刚说什么？
- What did you say?

795
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,050
我说木…我说蒙面纱
- I said Muf...I said...? Que pasa?

796
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,370
很好，你们给我走吧
Good. Now get out.

797
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,830
可是我们还是很饿
- Yeah,but we're still hungry.

798
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,630
滚！
- Out!

799
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,800
哇！辛巴，好大的嗝
- Whoa. Nice one,Simba.

800
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:37,950
是呀
- Thanks.

801
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,900
天啊！我肚子好胀
- Man,I'm stuffed.

802
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,420
我也是呀
- Me,too.

803
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,260
我吃得像只猪
I ate like a pig.

804
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,510
彭彭，你本来就是猪呀
Pumbaa,you are a pig.

805
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,190
哦，对啊
Oh. Right.

806
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,400
丁满
Timon

807
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,440
怎样？
What?

808
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,350
你有没有想过那些发亮的东西是什么？
Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there?

809
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,800
彭彭，我不用想
Pumbaa,I don't wonder,

810
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,800
我知道
I know.

811
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,710
那是什么？
Oh? What are they?

812
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,520
那些是萤火虫
They're fireflies... fireflies that got stuck...

813
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,840
那些萤火虫被一个大大的黑黑的东西困住了
up in that big blue-ish black thing.

814
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,940
哦…
Oh,gee.

815
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:25,330
我一直以为这是 几千万英里外的气体在燃烧
I always thought they were balls of gas... burning billions of miles away.

816
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,050
彭彭，你什么东西都是气体
Pumbaa,with you,everything's gas.

817
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,960
辛巴，你觉得呢？
Simba,what do you think?

818
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,440
我不知道
Well,I don't know.

819
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,090
快说，说…辛巴
Oh,come on. Give,give,give,give. Come on.

820
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,220
我们都告诉你了，拜托
- We told you ours. Please?

821
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,160
这个嘛… 怎样？
- Well...

822
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,320
以前有人跟我说过
somebody once told me...

823
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,690
过去那些伟大的君王 会在那些星星上看着我们
that the great kings of the past are up there... - watching over us.

824
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:47,650
真的？
- Really?

825
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,790
你是指那些 死掉的君王在看着我们
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?

826
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,920
谁这么告诉你的
Who told you something like that?

827
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,080
是呀，是呀
- Yeah.

828
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,700
是哪个笨蛋编的？
What mook made that up?

829
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,030
是啊，挺傻的对吧
Yeah,pretty dumb,huh?

830
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:07,030
笑死我了
- Aw,you're killing me.

831
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,910
我说错了什么？
Was it something I said?

832
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,130
辛巴？
Simba

833
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:15,140
他还活着？
He's alive? He's alive!

834
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,800
是时候了
It is time.

835
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,300
在这森林中、神奇森林中
In the jungle,the mighty jungle

836
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,500
狮子在睡梦中
The lion sleeps tonight

837
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,210
今夜月色朦胧要赶快行动
In the jungle,the mighty jungle

838
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,410
狮子在睡梦中
The lion sleeps to...

839
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,350
我听不见，彭彭
I can't hear you,buddy.

840
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,320
替我和音
Back me up.

841
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,970
彭彭？彭彭？
Pumbaa,Pumbaa!

842
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,900
丁满？
Timom?

843
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,320
彭彭？
Pumbaa?

844
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,730
彭彭
Pumbaa

845
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,840
彭彭…
Pumbaa...

846
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,190
彭彭，出了什么事？
Pumbaa Hey,what's going on?

847
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,590
他打算要吃我
She's going to eat me!

848
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,690
老天啊 为什么我每次都得救你
Jeez,why do I always have to save your...

849
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,600
别担心，彭彭 我就在你身边
Don't worry,buddy. I'm here for you.

850
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,690
一切都会没事的
Everything's going to be OK.

851
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,410
咬他…咬他的头
Get her! Bite her head!

852
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,840
看我的 咬他大动脉
Go for the jugular! The jugular!

853
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,810
你看吧，我早说过他会有用的
See,I told you he'd come in handy.

854
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,140
娜娜？
Nala?

855
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,810
真的是你吗？
Is it really you?

856
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,340
你是谁呀？
Who are you?

857
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,790
是我呀！辛巴
It's me... Simba.

858
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,950
辛巴？
Simba?

859
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,310
你怎么了？
- How did you...

860
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,580
是呀，是呀！ 你怎么会…
- But how did you...

861
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,380
你是从哪里来的？
- Wow! - Where did you come from?

862
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,670
我真的好高兴见到你
This is... it's great to see you!

863
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,830
我见到你才高兴呢！ 这到底怎么回事？
- Hey,what's goin' on here?

864
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,680
你到这儿来干什么？
- What are you doing here?

865
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:50,710
你这话什么意思？
What do you mean?

866
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,550
你怎么会在这里呢？
What are you doing here?

867
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,040
这到底怎么回事？
Hey! What's goin' on here?

868
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,260
丁满，这位是娜娜
Timon,this is Nala.

869
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,010
她是我最要好的朋友
She's my best friend.

870
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,980
朋友？
- Friend?

871
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,790
是啊
- Yeah.

872
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,790
喂！彭彭
Hey,Pumbaa,

873
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,080
快过来
come over here.

874
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,090
娜娜，这位是彭彭
Nala,this is Pumbaa.

875
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,210
彭彭，她是娜娜
Pumbaa,Nala.

876
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,120
很高兴认识你
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

877
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,930
这是我的荣幸 不客气
- The pleasure's all mine. - How do you do?

878
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,190
暂停！我先把事情搞清楚
Whoa,whoa! Time out! Let me get this straight.

879
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,160
你认识他 他认识你
You know her,she knows you.

880
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,030
但是她想要吃掉他
But she wants to eat him,

881
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,780
而大家好像都没什么意见
and everybody's OK with this?

882
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,360
我说错了什么没有？
- Did I miss something?

883
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,620
丁满，别激动嘛！
- Relax,Timon.

884
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,260
要是大家知道 你一直都在这里的话
Wait till everyone finds out you've been here all this time.

885
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:25,950
还有你妈妈…
And your mother...

886
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,760
她会怎么想呢？
what will she think?

887
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,560
她没有必要知道
She doesn't have to know.

888
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,080
谁都没必要知道
Nobody has to know.

889
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,310
他们当然要知道 大家以为你死了
Well,of course they do. Everyone thinks you're dead.

890
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,500
是吗？
They do?

891
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,730
是啊 刀疤告诉我们动物狂奔
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

892
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,480
是吗？
He did?

893
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,930
他还跟你们说了什么？
What else did he tell you?

894
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,030
那些并不重要 你还活着呀
What else matters? You're alive...

895
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,710
而这就表示…
and that means

896
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,420
你是国王
you're the king.

897
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,230
国王？
King?

898
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,590
小姐 你有没有搞错对象啊？
Lady,have you got your lions crossed.

899
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,850
国王？
King?

900
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,920
哎哟！我的国王 我匍匐在你脚前
Your majesty,I gravel at your feet.

901
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:57,920
不要闹了
Stop it.

902
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,440
少笨了，别傻了 搞什么？
It's not "gravel," it's "grovel," and don't!

903
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,250
他才不是国王呢！
He's not the king.

904
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,830
你是吗？ 不是
Are you? - No.

905
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,830
辛巴
- Simba!

906
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,220
不是，我不是国王
No,I'm not the king.

907
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,540
或许我以前可能会是国王
Maybe I was gonna be...

908
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,670
但是…那是很久以前的事了
but that was a long time ago.

909
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,650
让我把事情搞清楚
Let me get this straight.

910
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,870
你是国王
You're the king?

911
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,390
而你从没告诉我们
And you never told us?

912
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,910
我还是原来的我呀
- Look,I'm still the same guy.

913
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,130
但更有权势
- But with power.

914
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,720
麻烦你们俩位 先回避一下好吗？
Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?

915
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,110
不管她说什么 都可以在我们面前说
Hey,whatever she has to say... she can say in front of us

916
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,530
对不对？辛巴
right,Simba?

917
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,370
你们还是离开吧
Maybe you'd better go.

918
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,210
开始了吧
It starts.

919
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,090
我还以为我了解他呢
You think you know a guy.

920
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,550
丁满跟彭彭
Timon and Pumbaa...

921
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,190
你慢慢会喜欢他们的
you learn to love 'em.

922
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,290
怎么了？
What?

923
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,650
你怎么了？
What is it?

924
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,560
这就像你从死里复活一样
It's like you're back from the dead.

925
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,370
你不知道 这对大家的意义有多大
You don't know how much this will mean to everyone...

926
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,550
还有对我…
what it means to me.

927
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,720
嘿！没事的
Hey,it's OK.

928
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,330
我真的很想念你
I've really missed you.

929
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,890
我也想你呀
I've missed you,too.

930
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,990
彭彭，搞什么？
I tell you,Pumbaa.

931
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,540
恶不恶心
This stinks.

932
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,760
对不起
Oh,sorry.

933
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,930
不是你，是他们
Not you,them!

934
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,540
他、她…在一起
Him,her,alone.

935
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,740
那有什么不对？
What's wrong with that?

936
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,520
事实放在眼前
- I can see what's happening

937
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,360
什么？
- What?

938
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,170
你不必再犹豫
- And they don't have a clue

939
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:18,970
谁呀？
- Who?

940
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,300
把眼睛闭起都会看出来
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line

941
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,530
他们俩是一对
Our trio's down to two

942
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,370
哦
Oh

943
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:28,340
美丽纯洁的爱情
Ze sweet caress of twilight

944
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,440
这夜晚多么美
There's magic everywhere

945
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:36,570
让浪漫温馨充满每一处
And with all this romantic atmosphere

946
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:43,160
到处散发着爱
Disaster's in the air

947
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:51,790
这夜晚爱情到来
Can you feel the love tonight?

948
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:57,310
充满美丽温馨
The peace the evening brings?

949
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,250
所有万物也同样感受到
The world,for once In perfect harmony

950
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:09,550
显得如此平静
With all its living things

951
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,740
我想要说声爱你
So many things to tell her

952
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,720
不知该怎么说
But how to make her see

953
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,370
只有在心中告诉亲爱的
The truth about my past

954
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,010
你是我唯一所爱
lmpossible,she'd turn away from me

955
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,770
不要害怕说爱我
He's holding back,he's hiding

956
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,120
我心正在等待
But what,I can't decide

957
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:35,900
从你的双眼我看出来 你是我唯一所爱
Why won't he be the king I know he is The king I see inside

958
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,240
这夜晚爱情到来
Can you feel the love tonight?

959
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,780
充满美丽温馨
The peace the evening brings?

960
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,890
所有万物也同样感受到
The world,for once In perfect harmony

961
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,410
显得如此平静
With all its living things

962
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:06,340
这夜晚爱情到来
Can you feel the love tonight?

963
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:14,710
充满美丽温馨
You needn't look too far Stealing through

964
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,650
这一刻快闭上眼睛
The night's uncertainties

965
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:24,730
享受着平静
Love is where they are

966
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:31,910
从今以后剩我们俩  请你不要哭
And if he falls in love tonight It can be assumed

967
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:43,530
在我心底你是我朋友  从今直到永远
His carefree days With us are history In short,our pal Is doomed

968
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,880
你觉得这里怎么样？
Isn't this a great place?

969
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,000
这里好美哦
It is beautiful,

970
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,620
但是有一件事我不了解
but I don't understand something.

971
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,200
你既然一直都还活着
You've been alive all this time.

972
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,950
你为什么不回去呢？
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?

973
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,470
这…我只是想靠自己站起来
Well,I just needed to get out on my own,

974
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,480
过自己的生活
live my own life.

975
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,380
我这么做了 真的很棒
And I did,and it's great.

976
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,470
可是那边真的很需要你
We've really needed you at home.

977
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,220
没有人需要我
No one needs me.

978
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,580
不！我们需要
Yes,we do.

979
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,580
你是国王
You're the king.

980
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,520
能不能不要再提了 我不是国王
Nala,we've been through this. I'm not the king.

981
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,520
刀疤才是
Scar is.

982
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,500
辛巴，他让那些土狼 接管了得意之地
Simba,he let the hyenas take over the pride lands.

983
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:33,300
什么？
- What?

984
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,520
所有的一切都毁了
- Everything's destroyed.

985
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,200
没有食物、没有水
There's no food,no water.

986
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,050
辛巴，如果你不想办法 每个人都会挨饿
Simba,if you don't do something soon... everyone will starve.

987
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:39,820
我不能回去
- I can't go back.

988
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,530
为什么？
- Why?

989
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,280
你不了解的
- You wouldn't understand.

990
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,370
我不了解什么？
- What wouldn't I understand?

991
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,050
不…这些都不重要 HAKUNAMATATA
No,no,no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna matata.

992
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:45,830
什么？
- What?

993
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,160
是我在这儿学到的
HAKUNAMATATA - Hakuna matata.

994
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,610
有的时候 会发生一些不好的事情
It's something I learned out here.

995
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,610
Look,sometimes bad things happen...

996
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,100
辛巴 而你根本就无能为力
and there's nothing you can do about it,

997
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,720
所以你干嘛担心呢？
so why worry?

998
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,460
你不认为那是你的责任吗？
Because it's your responsibility.

999
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,130
那么你呢？你也离开了
Well,what about you? You left.

1000
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,880
我是为了要求救
I left to find help,

1001
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,110
而我找到了你 你还不明白吗？
and I found you. Don't you understand?

1002
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,630
你是我们唯一的希望
You're our only hope.

1003
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:07,920
抱歉！
Sorry.

1004
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:09,660
你到底是怎么了？
What's happened to you?

1005
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,270
你不再是我记忆中的辛巴了
You're not the Simba I remember.

1006
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,050
你说的对
You're right.

1007
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:14,510
我不是 现在你满意了吗？
I'm not. Now are you satisfied?

1008
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,570
不！我只是觉得失望
No,just disappointed.

1009
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,420
你知道吗？ 你说话开始像我爸爸了
You know,you're starting to sound like my father.

1010
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,480
很好！至少我们有人像他
Good. At least one of us does.

1011
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,320
娜娜
Nala

1012
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,720
你以为你的出现 就能改变我现在的生活吗？
Listen,you think you can just show up... and tell me how to live my life?

1013
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,240
你根本不知道我经历了什么
You don't even know what I've been through.

1014
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,940
如果你肯告诉我 我愿意…
I would,if you'd just tell me.

1015
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:29,880
算了
- Forget it!

1016
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,850
好
- Fine!

1017
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,720
她错了 我不能回去
She's wrong. I can't go back.

1018
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,180
事情都已经发生了
What would it prove,anyway?

1019
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,540
回去又能证明什么呢？
It won't change anything.

1020
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:44,480
这又改变不了任何事情
You can't change the past.

1021
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,740
你说你会永远在我身边的
You said you'd always be there for me!

1022
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,300
可是你没有
But you're not.

1023
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,620
都是因为我
And it's because of me.

1024
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,080
是我的错
It's my fault.

1025
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,340
是我的错
It's my fault.

1026
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,100
拜托你停一下，好吗？
Come on,will you cut it out?

1027
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:49,290
他停不下来 他会再回来的
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back.

1028
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,040
可恶的小猴子
Creepy little monkey.

1029
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,650
你能不能不要再跟踪我了
Will you stop following me?

1030
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,460
你是谁呀？
Who are you?

1031
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,460
问题是…你是谁呀？
The question is,who are you?

1032
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,470
我以为我知道
I thought I knew.

1033
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,790
现在我不确定了
Now I'm not so sure.

1034
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,670
我知道你是谁
Well,I know who you are. Shh.

1035
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,310
来，这是秘密
Come here. It's a secret.

1036
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,060
够了 你说这些到底什么意思？
Enough already! What is that supposed to mean,anyway?

1037
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,980
这表示你是狒狒 我不是
It means you are a baboon,and I'm not.

1038
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,000
我看你是有点老糊涂了
I think you're a little confused.

1039
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,530
错了 老糊涂的人不是我
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.

1040
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,370
你连你是谁都不知道
You don't even know who you are.

1041
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,010
这么说你知道罗
- Oh,and I suppose you know. - Sure do.

1042
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,250
当然 你是木法沙的孩子
You're Mufasa's boy.

1043
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,090
拜拜
bye

1044
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,860
喂！等等…
Hey,wait!

1045
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,940
你以前认识我爸爸？
You knew my father?

1046
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:42,910
修正一下
Correction...

1047
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:46,450
我现在认识他
I know your father.

1048
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,100
我很不想这么说
I hate to tell you this...

1049
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,850
但是他死了
but he died...

1050
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:51,920
死了好久了
a long time ago.

1051
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:55,010
不，又错了
Nope. Wrong again!

1052
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,830
他还活着 我可以带你去看他
He's alive,and I'll show him to you.

1053
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:00,220
你跟着拉飞奇 他知道怎么走
You follow old Rafiki. He knows the way.

1054
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,280
跟我来，乖
Come on!

1055
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,820
别拖拖拉拉的… 快点啦
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

1056
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,880
等等…
Hey,whoa,wait,wait.

1057
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,460
快点，快点
Come on. Come on!

1058
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,920
慢一点好吗？
Would you slow down?

1059
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,940
站住
Stop!

1060
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,980
往下看
Look down there.

1061
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,330
那不是我爸爸
That's not my father.

1062
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,550
那只是我的倒影
- That's just my reflection.

1063
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,810
不…
- No.

1064
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,780
仔细看
Look harder.

1065
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,450
你看
You see?

1066
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,220
他活在你心中
He lives in you.

1067
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,550
辛巴
Father?

1068
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,460
爸爸
Simba,

1069
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,310
辛巴，你已经忘了我
you have forgotten me.

1070
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,430
不！我怎么忘得了
No. How could I?

1071
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:48,280
你已经忘了你是谁 也忘了我
You have forgotten who you are,and so have forgotten me.

1072
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,960
看看你自己的内心
Look inside yourself,Simba.

1073
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,710
你比你现在还要聪明
You are more than what you have become.

1074
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,710
你一定要回到食物链的位置上
You must take your place in the circle of life.

1075
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,800
我怎么能回去呢？
How can I go back?

1076
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,620
我已经不是以前的我了
I'm not who I used to be.

1077
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:05,560
要记住你是谁
Remember who you are.

1078
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,470
你是我儿子
You are my son,

1079
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:11,050
也是唯一的国王
and the one true king.

1080
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,660
要记住你是谁
Remember who you are.

1081
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,670
不！求求你
No! Please,

1082
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,610
不要离开我
don't leave me!

1083
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,670
要记住
- Remember.

1084
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,260
爸 记住…
- Father!Remember.

1085
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,800
不要离开我
Don't leave me.

1086
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:26,000
记住…
Remember.

1087
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,950
那是什么？嘿嘿…
What was that?

1088
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,660
那天气非常的特别
The weather...

1089
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:38,700
你觉得呢？
very peculiar,don't you think?

1090
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,310
是呀
Yeah.

1091
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,830
看来风向好像要改变了
Looks like the winds are changing.

1092
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:44,600
哦…改变是好的
Ahh,change is good.

1093
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,610
是呀！但是并不容易
Yeah,but it's not easy.

1094
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,800
我知道我必须做些什么 但是…
I know what I have to do...

1095
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:52,300
回去就表示 我必须面对我的过去
but going back means I'll have to face my past.

1096
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,300
我逃避过去已经逃了那么久了
I've been running from it for so long.

1097
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:56,650
哦！老天啊
Jeez,

1098
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:57,780
你这是干嘛？
what was that for?

1099
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,040
那并不重要，过去就别管了
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

1100
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,300
是呀！但是我还是会心痛
Yeah,but it still hurts.

1101
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,460
过去是会让人心痛
Oh,yes,the past can hurt.

1102
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,590
但是依我看
But the way I see it,you can either run from it...

1103
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:11,410
你是可以逃避它 或者记取教训
or learn from it.

1104
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,090
哈…你学会了 现在怎么办？
You see? So,what are you going to do?

1105
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,550
首先我要拿走你的拐杖
First,I'm gonna take your stick.

1106
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,810
不…你别拿我拐杖
No,no,no,no! Not the stick!

1107
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,100
你到哪儿去呀？
Hey! Where are you going?

1108
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,770
我要回去了
I'm going back!

1109
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,040
好，去呀 离开这里
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1110
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,130
喂，醒醒啊
Grubs! Grubs!

1111
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,070
彭彭，丁满
Hey,wake up.

1112
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,270
是我呀，没事啊
It's OK! Whoa,whoa! It's OK! It's me!

1113
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:00,790
以后不要再这样吓我们了
Don't ever do that again.

1114
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,600
又是动物
Carnivores... oy!

1115
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,090
你们有没有看到辛巴？
Have you guys seen Simba?

1116
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,310
我还以为他跟你在一起
I thought he was with you.

1117
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,990
但是我现在找不到他 他在哪里啊？
He was,but now I can't find him. Where is he?

1118
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,090
你在这里找不到他的
You won't find him here!

1119
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,250
哈哈…国王已经回去了
The king has returned.

1120
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,320
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1121
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,390
他回去了
He's gone back.

1122
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,260
回去？你什么意思？
Gone back? What do you mean?

1123
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,170
喂！这到底怎么回事？
Hey,what's goin' on here?

1124
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,290
那猴子是谁？
Who's the monkey?

1125
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:23,760
辛巴要回去向刀疤挑战
Simba's come back to challenge Scar.

1126
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:24,660
谁？ 刀疤
- Who? - Scar.

1127
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,500
谁叫刀疤？
- Who's got a Scar?

1128
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,530
不…那是他叔叔
- No,no,no. It's his uncle.

1129
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:27,570
那猴子是他叔叔？
- The monkey's his uncle?

1130
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,090
不，辛巴要回去向他叔叔挑战
- No! Simba's gone back...

1131
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,500
并且取回王位
to challenge his uncle,to take his place as king.

1132
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,960
哦…
oh..

1133
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:32,580
辛巴，等等
Simba,wait up!

1134
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,720
很可怕，对不对？
It's awful,isn't it?

1135
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,650
你跟我说的时候 我并不愿意相信
I didn't want to believe you.

1136
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,940
是什么让你想回来的？
What made you come back?

1137
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,890
因为我的理智终于被敲醒了
I finally got some sense knocked into me...

1138
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,310
我头上还有包包可以证明呢！
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1139
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,890
话说回来这是我的国度
Besides,this is my kingdom.

1140
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:51,770
如果我不为它而战 还有谁会？
If I don't fight for it,who will?

1141
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,220
我会
- I will.

1142
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:54,740
这是很危险的
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1143
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:55,960
危险？哼！
Danger? Ha!

1144
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,840
我会当面嘲笑危险 哈哈…
I laugh in the face of danger.

1145
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,970
我觉得这件事一点也不好笑
I see nothing funny about this.

1146
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,940
丁满、彭彭 你们来这儿干嘛？
Timon,Pumbaa,what are you doing here?

1147
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,170
我们随时为陛下服务
At your service,my liege.

1148
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:08,040
哦，我们就为了这些…
Oh,we're gonna

1149
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,050
要向你叔叔挑战？
fight your uncle for this?

1150
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,050
是的，丁满 这里是我的家
Yes,Timon. This is my home.

1151
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,830
哦，这里是该大肆整顿了
Oh,talk about your fixer-upper.

1152
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,150
哦，辛巴
Well,Simba,

1153
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:21,700
如果这对你很重要 我们会永远支持你
if it's important to you... we're with you to the end.

1154
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,500
土狼…我恨土狼
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1155
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:43,280
要穿过那些家伙 你有什么好计划？
So,what's your plan for getting past those guys?

1156
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,440
用活的饵
- Live bait.

1157
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,700
好主意
- Good idea. Hey!

1158
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,410
来吧，丁满 你们去分散他们的注意力
Come on,Timon. You guys have to create a diversion.

1159
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,650
你要我怎么做？ 穿上裙子跳草裙舞吗？
What do you want me to do,dress in drag and do the hula?

1160
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,330
假如你要尝尝美味多汁的鲜肉
If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat

1161
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,230
远在天边近在眼前不必花心思
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat

1162
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,330
这只猪很肥包你吃满意
Come on down and dine on this tasty swine

1163
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,820
不必客气快来吃个饱
All you have to do is get in line

1164
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,270
你会痛吗？ 砰砰砰
- Are you achin' - Yep,yep,yep.

1165
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,010
来，先来一客 砰砰砰
- For some bacon? - Yep,yep,yep.

1166
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,440
瞧瞧他有多棒 砰砰
- He's a big pig - Yep yep.

1167
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,700
你可以向他一样酷
You could be a big pig,too,oy!

1168
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,320
娜娜
Nala,

1169
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,810
你先去找我妈 然后集合所有的狮子
you find my mother and rally the lionesses.

1170
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,160
我去找刀疤
I'll look for Scar.

1171
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:25,330
沙拉碧
Sarabi!

1172
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,250
什么事？刀疤
Yes,Scar?

1173
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,250
你们的狩猎队呢？
Where is your hunting party?

1174
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,770
他们没有尽职地工作
They're not doing their job.

1175
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,580
刀疤，已经没有食物了
Scar,there is no food.

1176
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,610
动物都离开了
The herds have moved on.

1177
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,170
不！他们只是没有认真找而已
No,you're just not looking hard enough.

1178
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:52,110
结束了，这里什么都没有
It's over. There is nothing left.

1179
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
我们只剩下一个选择
We have only once choice.

1180
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,010
我们必须离开荣耀石
We must leave Pride Rock.

1181
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,470
我们什么地方都不去
We're not going anywhere.

1182
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,400
那么你是在判我们死刑
Then you have sentenced us to death.

1183
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,270
那么就死吧
- Then so be it.

1184
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,600
你不能那么做
- You can't do that.

1185
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,060
我是国王我爱怎么做都可以
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1186
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,280
如果你有木法沙王的一半…
If you were half the King Mufasa was...

1187
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:09,190
我比木法沙王要强上十倍
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1188
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:12,420
木法沙？
Mufasa?

1189
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,090
不！你死了
No,you're dead.

1190
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,850
木法沙？
Mufasa?

1191
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:26,590
不，是我
No. It's me.

1192
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,980
辛巴？
Simba.

1193
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,960
你还活着？
You're alive?

1194
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,540
怎么可能呢？
How can that be?

1195
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:33,150
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

1196
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,380
我回来了
I'm home.

1197
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,670
辛巴？
Simba?

1198
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,930
辛巴！
Simba!

1199
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:43,840
看到你还活着 真让我有一点…惊讶
Oh,I'm a little surprised to see you... alive.

1200
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,460
给我一个好理由 让我不致于撕烂你
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1201
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,620
辛巴，你一定要了解
Oh,Simba,you must understand.

1202
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,140
统治一个国度的压力呀！
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1203
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,300
这国度不再是你的了 退位吧，刀疤
Are no longer yours. Step down,Scar.

1204
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,250
哈…是啊 我会的
Oh,well,I would,

1205
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,530
当然会啦！
naturally.

1206
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,990
但是这里有个小问题
However,there is one little problem.

1207
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,960
看到他们没有？
You see them?

1208
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,610
他们认为我是国王
They think I'm king.

1209
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,870
我们不认为
Well,we don't.

1210
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,130
辛巴才是合法的国王
Simba's the rightful king.

1211
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,170
选择权在你手上
The choice is yours,Scar.

1212
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,420
退位不然就战斗
Either step down or fight.

1213
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,270
难道非要用暴力解决吗？
Oh,must this all end in violence?

1214
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:21,150
我不喜欢为 家族成员的死亡来负责
I'd hate to be responsible... for the death of a family member.

1215
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:22,630
你同意吗？辛巴
Wouldn't you agree,Simba?

1216
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,570
你说这些都没有用，刀疤
That's not gonna work,Scar.

1217
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:25,890
我已经把它遗忘了
I've put it behind me.

1218
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,800
但是你那些忠实的臣民呢？
But what about your faithful subjects?

1219
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,700
他们也忘掉了吗？
Have they put it behind them?

1220
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,800
辛巴，他到底在说什么？
Simba,what is he talking about?

1221
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:36,100
哦！你还没有告诉她们 你那些小秘密？
Ah,so you haven't told them your little secret.

1222
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,190
辛巴，现在你有机会告诉他们
Well,Simba,now's your chance to tell them.

1223
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:44,130
告诉他们木法沙的死 到底该由谁来负责！
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.

1224
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:48,600
是我
I am.

1225
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:54,370
这不是真的
It's not true.

1226
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,860
告诉我这不是真的
Tell me it's not true.

1227
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,440
是真的
- It's true.

1228
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,600
看吧，他承认了
- You see? He admits it!

1229
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,970
凶手…
Murderer!

1230
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,390
不！那只是个意外
No,it was an accident.

1231
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,260
如果不是为了你 木法沙还会活着
If it weren't for you,Mufasa would still be alive.

1232
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,900
他的死是你的错 你能否认吗？
It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it?

1233
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:09,710
不能
No

1234
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,110
那么你是有罪的了
Then you're guilty.

1235
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,400
不！我不是凶手
No,I'm not a murderer.

1236
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,110
辛巴，你又再度有麻烦了
Oh,Simba,you're in trouble again...

1237
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,050
但是这一回爸爸 可没办法来救你了
but this time,daddy isn't here to save you...

1238
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,700
现在每个人都知道原因了
and now everyone knows why!

1239
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,870
辛巴
Simba

1240
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,140
这一幕看起来很眼熟
Now,this looks familiar.

1241
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,660
我以前在哪儿看过？ 我想想看哦！
Where have I seen this before?

1242
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,100
哦！对了！我想到了
Let me think.

1243
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:45,200
这正是你爸爸 要死之前的那个情景
Oh,yes. I remember. This is just the way your father looked before he died.

1244
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:50,790
而这是我的小秘密
And here's my little secret...

1245
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,610
我杀了木法沙
I killed Mufasa.

01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,060
凶手
Murderer!

1247
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,350
不！辛巴，求求你
No,Simba,please.

1248
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,550
告诉他们真相
Tell them the truth.

1249
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:02,520
真…相？
Truth?

1250
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:05,130
但是每个人对真相的看法都…
But truth is in the eye of the behold...

1251
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:11,340
好…是我干的
All right. All right. I did it.

1252
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,050
让大家都听得见
So they can hear you.

1253
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:18,150
我杀了木法沙
I killed Mufasa!

1254
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:33,070
我打、我踢、我踹 我砍、我砍、我咬
Excuse me. Pardon me. Comin' through. Hot stuff.

1255
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,880
放我出去，放我出去
- Let me out! Let me out!

1256
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,400
让我进去，让我进去
- Let me in! Let me in!

1257
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:06,620
拜托不要吃我
Please,don't eat me.

1258
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,210
放下他们
Drop 'em!

1259
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:09,720
那只猪是谁呀？
- Hey,who's the pig?

1260
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:10,530
你是在叫我吗？
- Are you talkin' to me?

1261
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:11,630
他在叫他猪
- Uh-oh,they called him a pig.

1262
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,190
你在叫我吗？ 怎么可以叫他猪
- Shouldn't have done that. - Are you talking to me?

1263
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:15,310
你在叫我吗？ 你们糗大罗
- Now they're in for it.Take that,you stupid...

1264
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:20,970
他们都管我叫猪大爷
- They call me Mister Pig!

1265
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:54,710
凶手
Murderer.

1266
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,770
辛巴，辛巴
Simba. Simba,please.

1267
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,910
求求你 求求你大发慈悲
Please,have mercy. I beg you.

1268
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,140
你根本不配活着
You don't deserve to live.

1269
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,720
但…是，辛巴…
But,Simba,

1270
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,750
我是…我是你的家人
I am family.

1271
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,670
那些土狼才是我们真正的敌人
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1272
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,340
都是他们的错 是他们的点子
It was their fault. It was their idea.

1273
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,840
我为什么要相信你？
Why should I believe you?

1274
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,640
你告诉我的每一件事都是谎言
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1275
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,390
你打算要怎么做呢？
What are you going to do?

1276
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:22,100
你该不会杀了你的亲叔叔吧？
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1277
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,810
不，刀疤
No,Scar,

1278
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,070
我可不像你
I'm not like you.

1279
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,530
辛巴，谢谢你 太好了
Oh,Simba,thank you. You are truly noble.

1280
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,110
我保证会补偿你的
I'll make it up to you,I promise.

1281
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,300
我该怎么做才能向你证明呢？
And how can I prove myself to you?

1282
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,500
告诉我什么都行
Tell me. I mean,anything.

1283
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,630
好
Run.

1284
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,120
离开这里，刀疤
Run away,Scar,

1285
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,350
永远不要再回来
and never return.

1286
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,290
是啊，当然啦
Yes. Of course.

1287
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,880
如你所愿
As you wish,your

1288
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,330
国王陛下

1289
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,910
我的朋友们
My friends.

1290
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,400
朋友们？
Friends?

1291
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,690
我好像听他说 我们是他的敌人
I thought he said we were the enemy.

1292
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:52,430
是啊！我也是这么听说的
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1293
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:55,110
阿德？
- Ed? - Ed?

1294
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,400
不，听着，我可以解释
No,no. Let me explain.

1295
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:01,830
你们并不了解
No,you don't understand!

1296
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,540
不…我不是故意的
No,I didn't mean...

1297
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:07,060
不…听我解释
No..

1298
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,330
是时候了
It is time.

1299
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,690
要记住
Remember.

1300
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:22,960
靠着阳光走
Till we find our place

1301
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:28,450
慢慢你会知道
On the path unwinding

1302
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:38,010
看这世界生生不息
In the circle

1303
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:42,600
生生不息
The circle of life
