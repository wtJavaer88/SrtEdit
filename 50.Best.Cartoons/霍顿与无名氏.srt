Nool丛林里

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,030
酷暑难耐

在沁人心脾的池塘里

就是它了
There it is.

这是丛林里最为奇特的物种之一

绿盲蝽

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,070
为了躲避捕食者

他把自己伪装成一片树叶

这家伙抓得可真紧

来吧 小东西! 别害羞!

我想我弄错了 孩子们
I guess I was mistaken, Kids.

这里显然没有绿盲蝽

即便是... 噢！他们爬到我身上来了

看 这儿有呢

00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,910
我想我吸进去了一只

快喷出来! 呃 喷不出来
Shoot up! Uhek it's not coming.

29
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,900
把它扯出来

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,800
呃 好吧
Uh, OK.

31
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,470
在一旁唧唧哼哼的 就是坏脾气的袋鼠
Then, humphing her nose was sour Kangaroo.

32
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,750
这家伙总认为自己比谁都聪明
A type who's convince she knows better than you

33
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,970
她自诩为Nool的丛林之王
She made every law and then forced every rule

34
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,160
她制定了每一条法规 并强制别人执行
as self conclaimed head of the jungle of the Nool.

35
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,250
妈妈 我为什么不能和别的小朋友一起玩?
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

36
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,000
我跟你说过多少遍了?
How many times have I told you?

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,430
丛林容不得兽行
The jungle is no place to act like a wild animal.

38
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,790
天呐 那个Horton总这么古怪的?
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric?

39
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,630
孩子们从他身上学到了不少东西呢
And that children are learning so much from him.

40
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,760
学会了如何成为低能儿
Learning to be a bunch of a hell brain halfwits.

41
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,270
这就是为何我的Rudy得在育儿袋里接受教育的原因
And that's why my Rudy is pouch schooled.

42
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,840
在袋鼠还在冷嘲热讽时
So, while Kangaroos still there sneering a sneer

43
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,720
Horton 这简直是我生命里最精彩的时刻
Horton,how it's the best time of my life.

44
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,480
你打算再教我们什么呢?
What are you gonna show us then?

45
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,420
那粒小浮尘又飘到了Horton的耳边
Once again the speck floated right by Horton's ear.

46
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,540
他又听到了
And he heard it again.

47
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,230
只是一声非常微弱的叫唤 好像是有小东西在求救
Just a very faint yelp, as if some tiny person were calling for help.

48
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,900
你知道他怎么想的吗?
And you know what he thought?

49
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,360
他想 准是有人住在那粒小浮沉上
What he thought there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust.

50
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,710
甚至可能有一家子住在上面 绝对有可能
Or even a famly. It just might be so.

51

拖儿带女的一大家子
A family with children just starting to grow.

52
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,700
我想活下去!
I wanna live!

我得走了 Katie 交给你了
I got to go. Katie, you're in charge.

54
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,290
等等!
Wait!

55
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,940
回来!
Come back!

56
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,200
再来一个 再来一个 再来 再来
One more, one more, one more, one more.

57
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,620
- 啊 有人来了  - 给我看看
- Ah here someone coming.  - Get here those.

58
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,240
- 等等!  - 拉警报!
- Wait!  - Sound the alarm!

59
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,600
借过! 小心被踩到!
Excuse me! On my stamp feet!

60
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,010

拿箭来!

63
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,270
我喜欢香蕉味满溢的早晨
I love the smell of the banana's in the morning.

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,900
香蕉炮!

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,590
别这样 伙计们! 我们都是哺乳类的!
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

66
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,730
我感觉外交关系就要破裂了

我就知道

74
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,870
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

75
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,510
- Horton?　- 抱歉
- Horton?  - Uhoo, sorry.

76
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,850
我只是... 哈
I just...ah.

77
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,430
有粒浮尘
There was this speck.

78
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,180
而且... 他们在呼救

- 然后我...  - 这浮尘...

80
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,860
呼救了?
called out for help?

81
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,640
浮尘怎么可能会呼救 我是说
Well not the speck. I mean

82
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,640
这太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

83
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
你是这么想的?
Is what you thought I've been?

84
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,950
当然 浮尘怎么可能会呼救 拜托
No,the speck can't call out for help. Come on.

85
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,460
现实点儿吧!
Get real!

86
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,540
不
No.
There's a tiny person on that speck and he needs my help.

87
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,540
有个小人儿住在这上面 他需要我的帮助

88
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,330
荒谬
Absurd.

89
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,330
怎么可能有这么小的人儿
There aren't people that small.

90
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,750
哇哦 也许不是他们小
Whoa, maybe thay aren't small.

91
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,100
也许...
Maybe...

92
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,100
是我们太大
We're big.

93
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,550
- Horton!  - 不! 真的 想想
- Horton!  - No! Really, think about it.

94
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,910
要是真的有人
What if there is someone

95
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,190
正在高高的上方
way out there,

96
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,420
俯瞰我们的世界呢
looking down on our world right now.

97
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,880
对他们而言 我们也只是浮尘而已
And to them, we are the speck.

98
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,820
然后有人走过来 他说
And then this someone else come along, he say,

99
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,260
"噢 怎么可能有这么小的人儿
"Oh, there can't be people that small."

100
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,180
前面那个人就说
And the first guy would say

101
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,400
"那你认为我是在撒谎?"
"Are you calling me a liar?"

102
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,330
后面个人就说
And the second guy would say

103
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,100
"要真的 当然会相信
"If the shoe fits wear it,

104
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,380
而你是个傻子"
and now that fits a blind."

105
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,470
前面个人休息吃晚饭
and the first guy pick supper break.

106
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,150
要是想听下面部分 你最好先把育儿袋拉上
And you might wanna zip up the pouch for this next part.

107
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,420
好吧 胖子!
Alright, fat boy!

108
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,280
- 你要来点儿...  - Horton?
- You want some of there...  - Horton?

109
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,760
浮尘上什么都没有
There is nothing on that speck.

110
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,350
但我听到了
But I heard.

111
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,910
是吗? 真的? 天呐!
Did you? Really? Oh my!

112
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,060
那我怎么听不到
Then how come I don't hear anything.

113
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,190
好吧?
Well?

114
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,820
如果你既看不到 听不到 又感觉不到某种东西
If you can't see, hear, or feel something

115
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,380
那这种东西就压根儿不存在
it doesn't exist.

116
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,130
而且在Nool丛林里 相信虚构的小人儿的存在 不是我们该做的
And believing in tiny imaginary people is just not something we do.

117
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,910
也是我们所不能容忍的
Or tolerate here in the jungle of Nool.

118
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,300
是吗?
Really?

119
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,950
因为我亲耳所闻
Cause I verified I really tried

120
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,830
我会找到的
I can find somebody

121
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,740
- 相信我的人的  - 你不准这么做
- who believe what I'm saying.  - You will do nothing of the sort.

122
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,910
不准再跟任何人提起这个谎言
You will not breathe the word of this lie to anyone else.

123
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,930
特别是孩子们
Expecially the children.

124
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,230
我不会让你用你的荒谬言论 去毒害他们的心灵的
I do not want you poisoning their minds with this nonsense.

125
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,740
国有国法 Horton
Our community has standards, Horton.

126
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,600
如果你还想在这里混 你就得好好守这里的规矩
If you wanna remain a part of that I recommend you follow them.

127
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,880
祝你有美好的一天
Have a nice day.

128
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,270
好的!
Alright then!

129

我会... 谨遵教诲
I'll ah...take that an advisement.

130
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,240
多谢提醒
Certainly appreciate your input.

131
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,780
我不明白
I don't understand.

132
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,190
我明明听到你的声音了
I know I heard you.

133
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,350
就像我确定我脸上长着鼻子一样
It was just as clean as nose on my face.

134
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,440
对了
That's it.

135
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,530
或许你听不见我说话!
Maybe you can't hear me!

136
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,510
因为你的耳朵肯定很小
Of course your ears must be tiny.

137
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,460
我得大点儿声!
I need to speak up!

138
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,640
你好!
Hello!

139
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,980
现在那些高高在上的人
Now some people out there

140
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,280
或许如我所了解的那样
might think I know who

141
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,250
他们会同意坏脾气袋鼠的话
they find they agreed with that Sour Kangaroo

142
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,110
"不可能会有跟老鼠一般大小的人"
"There can't really be people as small as a mice"

143
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,380
当然会有 的确有
Well there can. And there are.

144
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,070
因为Horton是对的
Becuase Horton was right.

145
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,770
你好!
Hellow!

146
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,710
这句"你好"随风飘扬
That single "Hello" traveled all the way down

147
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,800
飘到浮尘上 花朵上 飘进小镇的喷泉里
to the speck,to the flowers, to the fount of the small town.

148
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,340
这小镇叫无名镇 因为这里住着无名氏
The town known as Whoville for there live the Whos

149
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,280
这里安居乐业 充满喜庆
Really happy in safe, knowing only good news,

150
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,640
他们从没意识到 他们的世界只是苜蓿花上的一粒浮尘
unaware that their world was a speck on a clover,

151
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,170
他们从没意识到 这种甜蜜的生活或许会成为过去
unaware the sweet life they knew might be old

152
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,850
无名镇的镇长 是一个叫McDodd的男人
The Mayor of Whoville a man named McDodd

153
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,530
他鞠躬尽瘁 公正严明 但也有点古怪
who's devoted and faired and little bit odd.

154
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,480
镇长和他的妻子有一大堆孩子
The Mayor and his wife they had children to spare.

155
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,180
九十六个女儿 这儿有一些 那儿还有一些
96 daughters, some here and some there.

156
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,860
这九十六个女儿都需要爱护和教育
96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach.

157
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,910
而镇长在每个女儿身上只能花个几秒钟
But the Mayors have only few second for each.

158
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,460
爸爸 我的无名镇史考试拿了优
Daddy, I do better than best on my whostory test.

159
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,530
啊 无名镇史 我倒背如流
Ah, whostory. I remembered well.

160
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,820
真是我的乖女儿
That's one of my girls.

161
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,850
她老用我的梳子?
Her is has been using my hairbrush?

162
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,260
她才老用我的梳子
Her is has been using my hairbrush.

163
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,520
看 那边!
Look, over there!

164
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,210
好了 好多了
There, all better.

165
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,390
我能有部无名电话吗 爸爸?
Can I please have whophone, daddy?

166
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,340
班里每个同学都有
Everyone else in my class has one.

167
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,690
噢 是吗? 每个同学都有?
Oh, really? Everyone?

168
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,740
- 好吧! 我会考虑的  - 爸爸 看啊！爸爸快看!
- Aw! I will think about it.  - Daddy, look! Daddy look!

169
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,750
牙此!
Toos!

170
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,260
宝贝儿 念"齿" "牙齿"
It's "th" sweetheart. It's "Tooth"

171
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,880
无名镇的传统很与众不同
In Whoville tradition unlike yours or mine

172
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,110
一般来说 镇长的长子就是他的继承人
Mayor's oldest is the next Mayor of line.

173
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,840
那么这里又会是谁来继承衣钵 掌控大权呢?
And who was the oldest lead and stand tall?

174
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,950
是JoJo 镇长的儿子 最小的孩子
It was JoJo, his son, the smallest who all.

175
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,330
JoJo 有什么大新闻?
So, JoJo, what's what's shaking?

176
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,240
有什么事儿发生吗? 有什么变化没?
What's happening? What's the word?

177
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,380
你我都很清楚
Now to you or to me, it's finally clear

178
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,500
JoJo并不想继承父位
that JoJo did not want his father's career.

179
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,100
但镇长却完全不了解
But the Mayor pressed forward completely illuded.

180
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,540
JoJo默默地坐在一旁 昏昏欲睡
And JoJo just sat there in silence and lude it.

181
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,690
噢 JoJo!
Oh, JoJo!

182
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,280
- 嘿! 为什么他的时间要多些?  - 不公平!
- Hey! Why this he get more time?  - That's not fair!

183
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,210
儿子! 嘿!
Son! Hey!

184
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,630
他干嘛不说呢?
And why didn't he speak?

185
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,470
我想 他是担心 要是他说出来的话
Well I think the lad was frightened if he did,

186
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,540
会让他爸爸失望
he might let down his dad.

187
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,070
你知道什么才是让人敬畏吗?
You know what's awesome?

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
这就是让人敬畏!
This is awesome!

189
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,050
看看墙上挂着的这些伟人像
Just look at the men and the women hanging on these walls.

190
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:30,790
你 我的儿子 是这个延续了几个世纪的家族的继承人
You, my boy, are part of family legacy that spans centuries

191
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,780

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,910
你祖父是无名镇的镇长

祖父!

205
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,770
我希望有一天能加入他们
Some day I hope to join them.

206
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,810
成为伟人之一
Be one of the Grates.

207
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,480
我告诉你 JoJo 成为镇长是一件最伟大的事情
I tell you JoJo there is nothing like being Mayor.

208
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,260
我可以签署决议 批准法令 拟出财政预算
I get to sign resolutions, approve ordinances, submit budgets.

209
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,480
而在美食游行中
And in the edible parade

210
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,570
我是唯一一个坐在巨人头顶的人
I'm the one siting on top of the giant people.

211
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,750
而有一天
Some day

212
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,290
那个人就是你 JoJo
That can be you too, JoJo.

213
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,630
有一天 你会戴上镇长的羽饰
Some day you'll be the one wearing the Mayor crest.

214
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,160
你只要...
You just...

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,220
你只需要...
You just need to...

216
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,500
你明白我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

217
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,360

很高兴跟你聊天
I'm glad that we had this talk

219
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,350
虽然从头到尾都只有我一个人在说 很好
That I'm continuing now by myself. Good.

220
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,090
噢! 这儿 放这儿好了
Oh! There. There are to become fit.

221
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,600
Morton不会有事儿的 不会有什么事儿的
Nothing wrong with this，Morton. Nothing wrong with this.

222
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,160
只有你 我 还有这粒灰尘
Just you and me，and the speck

223
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,910
一起来闲聊
Shouldn't a breeze.

224
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,460
我们要团结 我们是一伙的
We're club. We're group.

225
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,410
要是有分歧 我们可以投票解决
We can take a vote on issues.

226
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,380
对社会来说 我们是
We can be a secret to society

227
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,940
- 控制世间海盗力量的秘密武器  - Horton?
- to control pirate's power in the world.  - Horton?

228
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,950
别人都无法加入
And no one else can join

229
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,790
除非他们戴上有趣的帽子
Unless they wear funny hats.

230
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,670
听着 Horton!
Listen, Horton!

231
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,890
主席准许Morton兄发言
The chair recognizes his brother Morton.

232
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,910
我很高兴你发现了这粒浮尘
I am really happy you found this speck in all.

233
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,550
但你自己知道就好了
But you might wanna think about keeping it to yourself.

234
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,290
呃 什么 什么?
Um, what, what?

235
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,000
你在跟那朵苜蓿花说话?
Are you talking to what clover.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,690
那可不大对劲儿
That doesn't look good.

237
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,960
你知道什么才是不对劲儿的吗?
You know what doesn't look good?

238
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,590
你 说得好像浮尘不存在一样
You, talking about the speck like the speck isn't even there.

239
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,750
浮尘可没说过你的坏话
Speck never said nothing bad about you.

240
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,320
但是 嘿!
But hey!

241
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,490
上帝保佑你幻想的优越感
Good luck with your illusional superiority.

242
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,450
那只是一粒灰尘 你可以随便说它对我有什么想法
You know, the speck can think anything you want about me. It's a speck.

243
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,280
哇!
Wow!

244
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,110
我明白了
I see what's going on here.

245
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,680
Morton 不管我和灰尘变的有多亲密
Morton, no matter how tight this speck and I get,

246
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,210
它都不能代替你
the speck could never replace you.

247
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,080
我只能说到这了
I'm only sad that I would have to explain that at this point.

248
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,780
好了Horton 我感觉好多了
Well, that's awesome Horton. That really helps.

249
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,240
尽量别张扬 回见
Just try to keep this to yourself. I'll see you later.

250
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,780
尽量哦
Try.

251
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,480
嗨 Horton? 你鼻子上拿的什么?
Hey, Horton? What's you got in there?

252
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,790
什么? 没什么
What? Nothing.

253
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,540
我们什么都没做
We're not doing anything.

254
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,710
- 我们是独自一人  - 干吗用我们?
- We are totally alone.  - Who's we?

255
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,880
我们? 什么我们? 我有说过吗?
We? What we? Did I say that?

256
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,460
我只是... 噢 不 我绝对不会那样说的
I just... Oh, no. I would never say that

257
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,150
那样不就暗示我和某人一起了么
because that would imply that I was with someone and not alone.

258
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,880
好吧 千万不能告诉其他人
OK There is a story you can't talk to anybody

259
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,840
我是说真的
I mean it.
If anybody finds out about this, it could be very very bad.

260
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,840
如果让其他人知道了 会非常非常糟糕

261
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,470
我也不知道为什么
I'm not sure why.

262
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,610
我们不会告诉别人
We won't tell anyone.

263
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,470
就算我们告诉别人了 我们也会叫他们不要告诉别人的
And if we do, we'll tell them not to tell anyone.

264
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,060
好极了!
Perfect!

265
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,940
好吧 当时我正在洗澡
OK. I'm taking a bath, right.

266
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,050
因为我的皮肤容易干燥 还有点脏
Cause my skin gets kind of dry. My roof gets ashy...

267
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,680
Horton承认了他发现的灰尘
While Horton came clean about the speck that he found

268
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,980
以及他是怎么拯救它的
How he saved it and nearly drowned.

269
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,910
镇长早上上班的时候
The Mayor set off on his morning commute

270
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,500
发现今天跟平时不太一样
and noticed things not quite the same on his route.

271
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,220
请不要责怪Horton 因为他也不知道
But please don't blame Horton for he didn't know

272
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,400
灰尘外一次剧烈的颠簸
that a strong bump above...

273
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,860
我像这样跳到水里
I do it in the water like this...

274
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,160
灰尘里却是一场地震
Was a big bump below.

275
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,770
嗨 Joe! 别太拼命!
Hey, Joe! Don't work too hard!

276
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,850
哈! 这种豪华公寓不可能自己建好的
Ah! These luxery condos they have gone themselves.

277
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,630
嘿 你看 原来他们真的能自己建好
Hey, you look at that. I guess they do build themselves.

278
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,670
噢 奇迹
OK, that happened.

279
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,580
镇长知道
Now the Mayor knew it was his job

280
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,830
将他发现的异象公布于众 是他的职责
to convey the unusual things that he noticed that day.

281
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,560
但是有个问题
There was one problem.

282
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,600
尽管他有强烈的信念
Though his will was strong

283
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,520
- 你迟到了  - 谢谢 Yelp小姐
- You are late.  - Thank you，Miss Yelp.

284
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,950
无名镇从未出过事
Nothing in Whoville had ever gone wrong.

285
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,430
我们从不贪求 我们珍惜所有
We have all that we need. We need all that we've got.

286
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,900
我们喜欢无名镇 我们非常喜欢
We like it in here Whoville. We like it a lot.

287
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,870
大家都忙于无名镇百年庆的筹备 所以...
We're all very busy with WhoCentennial's coming up. So...

288
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,300
赶紧开完会吧
Let's break this meeting to order.

289
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,310
镇长先生 你给我们带什么好消息了
Mr. Mayor I presume you have some good news for us.

290
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,880
是有消息 但我不知道
Well, it's news. I don't know

291
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,040
到底算好消息还是坏消息
if we need to go label it good or bad anything like that.

292
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,180
最近我发现无名镇有奇怪的现象
The thing is I have noticed some odd goings on in Whoville lately

293
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,170
好的奇怪的事?
Good on goings on?

294
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,990
例如 地震 龙卷云
Well, you know. Tremors, clouds swirling in the sky.

295
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,400
安全起见 我们是不是考虑...
And it seems to me just be safe, we might wanna consider...

296
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,490
推迟百年庆?
Postponing the WhoCentenia?

297
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,160
考虑什么?
Consider what?

298
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,480
推迟百年庆?
Postponing the WhoCentenia?

299
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,430
什么?! 大声点!
What?! Speak up, man!

300
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,220
推迟百年庆 行了吗?
Postponing the Whocentennial, alright?

我们要庆祝无名镇百年来的欢乐和谐

而你想推迟庆典?
And you want to postpone the celebration?

303

百年庆典将照计划进行!
The Whocentennial will proceed as planned!

309
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,810
镇长是个傻蛋
The Mayor was really being an idiot.

310
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,310
从现在起 只有微笑
It will be all smiles from now on.

311

十年前... 等等
Ten years ago... Wait a minute, hold on for a second.

317
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,380
我看起来像傻蛋吗?
Do I look like an idiot?

318
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,390
- 你不会想听答案的  - 我不是傻蛋
- You don't want me to answer that.  - I'm not an idiot.

319
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,640
说我是蠢材?
That's nerve call me a boob?

320
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,110
我从不会骂别人蠢材
I would never call somebody a boob.

321
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,120
他才是蠢材
He is a boob.

322
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,140

我打赌
And I bet.

325
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,860
把这钉书机摁你脑袋上 你就不会好看了!
You don't look so good with this staple on your head!

326
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,100
- 谢谢 Yelp小姐  - 不客气
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.  - You're welcome.

327
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,650

Who's there?

332
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,080
我是... 镇长
Hmm... This the Mayor.

333
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,330
镇长?
The Mayor?

334
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,710
镇长?
The Mayor?

335
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,810
哈 看 是镇长!
Uh, look at this Mayor!

336
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,590
我就知道
I knew it.

337
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,290
我就知道 我就知道 我就知道
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.

338
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,550
灰尘上有生命
There's life on this speck.

339
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,730
灰尘? 什么灰尘?
The speck? What speck?

340
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,860
是...
Well, um...

341
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,480
我不知道怎么跟你说 但是...
I don't exactly know how to tell you this. But...

342
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,490
你生活在一粒灰尘上
You're living on a speck.

343
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,220
我不想反驳你
Well, I hate to disagree with you.

344
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,120
下水道的声音
Oh, voice from the drain pipe.

345
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,350
可我生活在无名镇
But, I live in Whoville.

346
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,050
那无名镇就是一粒灰尘
Well, then the Whoville is a speck.

347
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,750
好了 严肃点 你是谁?
Right. OK Seriously. Who is this?

348
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,890
是学会计的Bert吗?
Is this Bert from accounting?

349
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,190
不是 我是Horton
No. This is Horton.

350
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,320
我是只大象
I'm an elephant.

351
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,630
好吧 Horton 一听就是假名
OK Horton, fake name.

352
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,910
你在哪?
Where are you?

353
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,200
从你站的地方看?
Well, from where you standing?

354
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,450
我想我在...
I guess I'm...

355
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,470
天上
in the sky.

356
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,970
和你比 我简直就是巨人
Compare to you I'm enormous

357
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,070
其实也不是
which is saying something

358
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,640
因为我最近在游泳减肥
because I slim down quite a bit. I swim.

359
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,510
在我的世界中 你的世界被固定在一朵花上
Your whole world fits on a flower in my world.

360
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,490
噢 这里也能装得下你 Bert
Oh, man, this is even inclusion for you, Bert.

361
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,750
不相信吗?
Don't believe me?

362
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,780
看看我把你放在树影下会发生什么
Watch what happen when I put you in the shade

363
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,560
- 一派胡...  - 暗
- This is absolutly impossi...  - Dark.

364
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,660
亮
Light.

365
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,020
暗
Dark.

366
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,880
亮
Light.
Dark, light, dark, light...Dark!

367
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,880
暗 亮 暗 亮...暗!

368
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,820
亮!
Light!

369
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,280
还不明白?
Don't you see it?

370
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,370
我们正处于某种神奇的宇宙交汇中
We're in the middle of some kind of amazing cosmic convergence.

371
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,810
两个迥异的世界
Two vastly different worlds.

372
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,940
奇迹般的交汇在一起!
Miraculously crossing path!

373
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,590
我的大世界!
Mine colossal!

374
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,360
你的小世界
Yours mini to cure.

375
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,160
竟然产生了沟通
Yet, somehow we've marriage to make contact.

376
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,420
想想看 太神奇了
If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.

377
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,170
你那还好吧?
Is everything OK down there?

378
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,330
噢 我... 我不知道
Oh. I... I don't know.

379
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,710
你说呢...
You tell me...

380
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,600
灰尘在你手里
You're the one holding the speck.

381
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,040
灰尘在我手里
I'm the one who's holding the speck.

382
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,440
灰尘竟然在我手里
I'm not holding the speck.

383
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,350
别担心 镇长先生
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

384
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,020
请等一下
Hold, please.

385
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,620
这意味着什么?
What at all this means?

386
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,200
镇长想不出来
The Mayor hadn't the clue.

387
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
因此 他去Larue博士的办公室
So he went to the office of Dr.Larue.

388
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,250
想借用一下专家的聪明脑袋
Brainest brain on the staff at Whouse.

389
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,520
Larue博士!
Dr. Larue!

390
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,490
噢 这太疯狂了
Oh, this is crazy.

391
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,870
噢 是镇长先生啊
Oh, Mr. Mayor.

392
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,300
我能帮你什么?
Ah, how may I be a assitance?

393
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,890
我不知道 呃
I don't know. Hey.

394
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,820
我就想知道
You know I just wondering

395
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,800
如果说我们的世界是一粒
If our world will stay tiny speck

396
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,500
飘在空中的小灰尘
floating to space,

397
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,810
我们怎么才能证明?
how would we know?

398
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,510
噢 干嘛问这种问题?
Oh, why would you ask something like that?

399
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,730
噢 没什么 随便问问
Oh, no reason, no reason at all.

400
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,530
我甚至都不记得 不 我记得
I don't even remember. Yes I do.

401
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,810
听着
That you know what,

402
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,710
有人跟我说
some guy was talking to me

403
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,150
那人不是天上的大象 而是地上的一个家伙
not an elephant in the sky, a guy on the ground

404
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,870
哈 那可能会产生几种结果
Ah, there would be several ramifications

405
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,710
是好的结果吗?
Good ramifications?

406
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,270
一粒小灰尘
A tiny speck.

407
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,420
是啊 小灰尘
Uhhuh, yeah, tiny speck.

408
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,490
飘来飘去...
Floating around...

409
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,760
已经发生了莫名其妙的地震
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors.

410
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,660
诡变的天气
Dramatic changes in the weather.

411
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,950
如果最终不能达到某种稳定状态
And if we didn't eventually achieve some sort of stability

412
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,640
我们的世界会 毁灭
our world would be destroyed

413
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,020
毁灭!
Destroyed!

414
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,990
毁灭 噢 毁灭 崩溃了
Destroyed, oh destroyed. No somehow.

415
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,360
Horton?
Horton?

416
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,390
噢 不 我是Danny Horton正在忙
Ah, no. This is Danny. Horton is busy right now.

417
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,350
开玩笑呢 是我
You, I'm joking. That's me.

418
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,840
我们完了
Ah, We're doomed.

419
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,440
听着! Horton!
Listen! Horton!

420
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,760
看来我需要你帮点小忙
Turns out I need your help a little bit.

421
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,370
很明显 如果任由那粒灰尘四处飘荡
Apparently if that speck keeps moving around,

422
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,820
我们的世界就会湮灭
our whole world could be obliterated.

423
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,260
因此
Ahuh So,

424
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,690
我需要你为我们无名氏找个安全稳定的家 越快越好
I need you to find us Who's safer more stable home and fast

425
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,440
没问题 镇长先生
No problem, Mr. Mayor.

426
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,510
让我看看...
Let's see...

427
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,570
那里看起来不错
That's a nice view.

428
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,920
喂 还好吗?
Hello, is everything OK?

429
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,830
上面怎么了?
What's going on up there?

430
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,930
整个丛林都危机四伏!
This entire jungle is a house of death!

431
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,310
噢 等等
Oh, wait.

432
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,570
那里不错
There's good spot.

433
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,120
这时 Horton看见Nool山顶
And it's then Horton saw at the top of mountain Nool

434
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,310
有一个绝佳的小山洞
a small cave that was peaceful and quiet and cool

435
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,460
那里向日葵欣欣向荣
where sun flower grew proud and tall from the ground.

436
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,150
在那里 每个无名氏都会
There he knew every Who would be safe,

437
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,320
平安无事
would be sound.

438
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,120
我找到了 镇长
I found it Mayor.

439
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,180
最完美的地方
The perfect place.

440
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,880
就在那
Right up there.

441
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,700
- 在Nool山顶  - 镇长先生?
- On the top of the mountain Nool.  - Mr. Mayor?

442
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,280
我希望我们能...
I wish we could...

443
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,500
喔呵呵 哈 真有光泽 啊哈哈
Ohho, Ah, Shiny. Ahha.

444
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,050
无名镇委员会正等着你
The Whocentennial Committee is waiting for you

445
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,580
检查美食游行的大肉丸
to look over the giant meat ball for the edible parade.

446
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,780
并且参加无名镇的晚宴
Oh, and then you will do at the dinners for your Whowill Canal.

447
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,290
在每个词前加"无名"
You know, sticking Who in front of everything

448
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,660
并不能加深意义
doesn't make it heard last.

449
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,030
只是浪费时间!
Just waste time!

450
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,610
我不想去
I don't wanna go.

451
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,660
听着 Horton 我得走了
Listen, Horton. I got to go.

452
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,980
看来大肉丸出事了
Apparently there's problem with the giant people.

453
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,670
你去当心肉丸吧
You just take care that meatball, Sir.

454
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,250
把事交给我吧
And leave the freaking out to me.

455
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,100
就这样 Horton开始了他的漫漫旅行
So, then Horton began his long pairless track

456
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,100
决心拯救灰尘上的小世界
determine to save the small world on the speck.

457
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,850
Horton充满忠贞 富有仁爱之心
Horton was faithful and soul working kind.

458
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,170
我抓住你了
I got ya.

459

他是勇敢的英雄

我会保护你的
I'll protect ya.

461
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,770
至少他是这么想的
At least in his mind.

462
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,270
我们必须隐身 潜行
We must become invisible. Travel silently.

463
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,920
因为有敌人 他们企图摧毁我们
For there're forces. They would seek to destroy us.

464
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,800
你以为这样就能阻止我 哼!
So, you think you can stick up on me, Huh!

465
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,800
很明显 你根本不是我的对手!
It's clear that you're no match for my ticky kei!

466
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,680
看来你对抽树枝很在行
I see you will master the way of snapping branch.

467
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,000
看筋斗!
Watch me tumble!

468
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,520
Horton! 我们上!
Horton! Let's go!

469
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,670
你很敏捷 Horton 但是袋鼠派来了猴子
You are fast, Horton. But the kangaroo has monkeys.

470
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,990
看我耍这些猴子
I will make monkeys of these monkeys.

471
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,590
这是他们的宿命 啊哈哈!
It is their destiny, Huh uh!

472
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,350
喔呀! 吃我一记冲击波!
HoiYat! My Tumble! My Tumble!

473
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,330
Horton是大英雄 哈!
Horton is the Greatest Hero of them all, Ha!

474
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,670
- Horton!  - Morton! 攻击!

475
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,610
呀 Nool山在那边!
Oh, mountain Nool is that way!

476
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,130
冲到Nool山顶
To the top of the mountain Nool.

477
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,020
冲啊 我就是这样想的
I sensed the fighting. All way I hope.

478
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,540
噢 抱歉伙计
Oh, sorry little fella.

479
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,420
你不会有事的
You'll be fine.

480
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,710
我只是在想象
Just the killing thought.

481
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,380
- Horton!  - Horton!
- Horton!  - Horton!

482
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,490
- 快看啊!  - 跟上!
- Look!  - Go go go!

483
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,140
我们都找到一朵有无名氏的苜蓿
We've all got own clovers with flowers on them.

484
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,780
我的世界里住的都是小马驹
In my world everyone's a pony

485
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,390
他们啃彩虹 追蝴蝶
and they all eat rainbows and poop butterflies

486
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,620
那可真可爱 Katie
That's beautiful, Katie.

487
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,550
虽然有点奇怪
In a really weird way.

488
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,120
我的世界是Jessica岛
My world is called Jessica land

489
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,110
每个人都崇拜 Jessica女王 Jessica就是个美人
Everyone worships queen Jessica because Jessica is the beautiful.

490
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,280
Jessica 太棒了

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,830
Rudy?
Rudy?
Mom, be careful!

492
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,830

我最好的朋友David就在上面
My best friend David grows up on there.

494
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,500
- Rudy 这上面没有人　 - 什么?

那个Horton是个危险分子
That Horton is a menace.

497
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,850
妈妈 妈妈 求你了 你真是莫名其妙

- 不要对我这样嘛 　- 宝贝 呆到袋子里去
- Don't do this to me.  - Honey, go to your room.

499
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,940
Horton!

500
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,640
漂亮

501
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,880
你以为你在干吗?

Ha, you got some worlds of trouble.

503
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,530
你忘了我们谈过的吗?
Have you forgotten what we discussed?

504
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,260
哦 当然不 我是个大象 大象好记性
Oh, no. I'm an elephant. And elephants never forget.

505
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,600
我们天性好记性
It's a curse, really.

506
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,740
我全记在脑子里呢
I remember I was on my head.

507
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,950
你说 我记着
And you said and I looked up.

508
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,950
你说你在干什么?
And you say what are you doing?

509
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,140
我说关于这个灰尘的
And I said the thing about the speck.

510
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,350
然后你拉我的耳朵
Then you pull my ears.

511
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,990
- 拍我的前额  - Horton?
- And you fork in a fore head.  - Horton?

512
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,250
你干了什么?
What You did?

513
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,370
把苜蓿给我 Horton
Give me that clover, Horton.

514
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,610
马上
Now.

515
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,800
不!
No!

516
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,390
不?
No?

517
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,390
对
Ya.

518
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,980
你确定你真的要干架吗 Horton?
Are you sure you wanna fight this fight, Horton?

519
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,450
我保证你会迅速落败 而且很难堪的
Becuase I promise you will get very ugly very fast.

520
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,150
你好好想想吧
And you need to ask yourself.

521
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,450
真的要和我作对吗?
Do I really worth put myself through this?

522
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,400
为了朵苜蓿?
For a clover?

523
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,310
照我说的办吧 Horton?
Take after me, Horton?

524
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,890
你不会的
You don't.

那么 交出来吧
So, hand it over.

526
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,720
不! 我不会把他交给你的
No! I can't give it to you.

527
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,990
灰尘上确实有人
There're people on this speck.

528
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,820
生活着很小的生物
Granted very small people.

529
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,300
但是 生命就是生命
But a person's person.

530
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,020
不管大小
No matter how small.

531
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,830
你太过分了 Horton
You just crossed the line, Horton.

532
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,330
我要让你付出代价
And I'm gonna make you pay.

533
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,960
Horton威胁着我们的生活
That Horton is a menace.

534
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,610
他迫使孩子们使用想象力
He has those kids using their imaginations.

535
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,020
真有病
It's sick.

536
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,280
好吧
Alright.
I got to get this speck up to the top mountain Nool ASAP.

537
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,280
我要把灰尘送到Nool山上去 "ASAP"(越快越好)

538
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,410
虽然不知道什么意思
Whatever that means.

539
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,630
可能就是说 "动作要敏捷漂亮 大象"
Probably "act swiftly awesome, pachyderm."

540
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,600
我是说这有什么难的
I mean how hard can it be.

541
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,310
这简直就是直接通往死亡的小道
It's just the straight plummet to certain death.

542
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,520
这个...
This looks...

543
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,100
有点不稳啊
kinda precarious.

544
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,550
不?
No?

545
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,010
不用担心
No need to worry.

546
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,030
很明显他们造桥时
Obviously when they build the bridge like this

547
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,940
他们会考虑大象会通过这里
they take into account the elephants will be corssing here.

548
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,430
好的 感觉不错
Alright. Feel good.

549
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,600
我只是... 喔 哇
I'll just get... Woo Waaa

550
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,790

You'll alright!

551
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,100
("勇气") 嗯 的确是那样
("COURAGE") Um, That's true.

552
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,540
好的
Alright.

553
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,280
你好 镇长先生 今天怎么样?
Hello and how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

554
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,910
说 啊
Say Ahh.

555
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,370
请漱口
Wrench, please.

556
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,600
呃 这些木板该换换了
Eh, I think a few of these wood that keep stand need to be replaced.

557
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,780
我只要想着我很轻
I just need to think light.

558
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,090
I'm light as a feather.

559
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,090
我要像羽毛一样
I'm light as a feather.

560
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,780
好重的羽毛啊
Heavy feather.

561
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,110
好了
OK.

562
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,780
就疼一下下
This will just pinch little.

563
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,480
我要比羽毛还轻
I'm lighter than a feather.

564
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,210
什么比羽毛还轻?
What's lighter than a feather?

565
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,920
哈! 空气!
Haah! Air!

566
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,840
没有更轻的了
There's nothing lighter.

567
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,980
这是显而易见的...
So, it stands to reason...

568
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,370
我吸入越多的空气我就
get the more air I have

569
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,110
越轻
the lighter

570
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,940
I'll be.

571
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,110

没事了 刚才太恐怖了
Alright. It was absolutely terrifying.

573
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,590
我要再试一次
If I just right some on

574
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,160
千万别害怕
drawing not to panic.

575
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,460
刚才真的好险
That could've been a disaster.

576
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,570
现在感觉棒极了
I feel really good right now.

577
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,560
这是我实现目标的好兆头
It is my new sense of purpose.

578
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,300
啊 没事了!

我只是想这样会好点
I just thought it might look better

601
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,520
如果睡觉时不被东西砸到的话
somewhere it can't fall on us and crashes our sleep.

602
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,760
到底怎么了?

that your world actually a tiny speck?

612
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,320
我先前跟你提到的那头大象
And then the elephant that I talked about earlier

613
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,300
正在带着粘在花上的灰尘转悠
he's carrying it around on a flower.

614
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,990
当你发现这个后
And you realize

615
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,490
如果你告诉别人 他们反而认为你疯了
then if you tell anybody they think you're crazy.

616
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,280
但你仍旧有责任保护他们的安全

你明白我的意思吗?
Do you know that feeling?

亲爱的 我知道你压力很大
Sweetheart. I know you're under a lot of stress.

625
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,360
如果你看见大象和花朵 那没关系
And if you're seeing the elephants and flowers, then fine.

626
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,870
别跟别人说
Just don't tell anyone else that story.

627
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,640
好吗? 要知道
OK? And remember.

还没到世界末日呢
It's not the end of the world.

629
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,080
世界末日?
The end of the world?

他对苜蓿着迷了

在还没有发生之前你是可以那样做

- 大象是百分百认真的  - 对啊

要想全部动员 我得先得到市委的许可
in order to get everyone mobilized I need the O.K. of the city council.

832
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,230
他们从来都不肯听我的
And they never listen to me.

833

1050
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,140
感觉不到 那就是不存在的

01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,090
除了那个被他坐上去的苍蝇窝

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,900
Except for that fly city he sat on.

1059
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,490
他也不是故意那样做的

不能伤害孩子们!
Not the children!

1065
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,310
Horton告诉孩子们丛林之外事情的同时
When Horton tells our children about worlds beyond the jungle,

1066
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,610
令他们质疑了我们的权威
it makes them question authority.

1067
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,820
Which leads to the fires, which leads to shocking!
这会导致混乱 这会导致灾祸!

1068
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,180
Yeah! Horton must pay!
没错! Horton要付出代价!

1069
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,730
吃掉那颗灰尘!
Eat that speck!

1070
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,700
我们要采取行动!
We have to do something!

1071
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,390
- 为了孩子们!  - 为了孩子们!
- For the children!  - For the children!

1072
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:51,210
我们能让他逃脱惩罚吗?
Are we going to let him get away with this?

1073
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:56,030
不!
No!

1074
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:22,410
Morton! 我告诉过你我会百分百守信!
Morton! I told you 100%!

1075
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,350
Horton

1076
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:27,990
- Morton 脚步轻点儿 天呐  - 不是我
- Morton, pick up your feet, Gee.  - It's not me.

1077
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,470
哦 呵呵 我明白了 是群愤怒的暴民
Oh, Hoho. I see. It's an angry mob.

1078
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,730
抱歉 Morton
Sorry Morton.

1079
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,720
我还以为是你闹出这么大动静...
I thought it's you who's making all the...

1080
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,750
但是这...
But it's...

1081
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,620
等等
Hold on.

1082
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,540
快跑 Horton!
Run, Horton!

1083
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,460
他在那里!
There he is!

1084
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:47,000
绑住他!

1085
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,070
Let's rope him!

1086
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,840
抓住他!
Let's take him!

1087
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,340
停!
Stop!

1088
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,460
嘿 伙计们
Hey, fellas.

很高兴见到你们
Good to see ya.

1090
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:03,730
还一次见到这么多人
All at once.

1091
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,780
你们聚在一起 看上去气色不错
You're look really great as herd.

1092
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,980
Horton, Horton, Horton look at that mess you created for yourself.
Horton Horton Horton 看看你给你自己整的烂摊子

1093
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:15,200
我们这样兴师动众 都是因为一朵傻傻的小花
All this hullabaloo over us is a silly little flower.

1094
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,950
这是一粒灰尘
It's a speck.

1095
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,280
好吧
Right.

1096
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,680
我是说 讨论把你捆起来关进笼子 实在是太傻了
I mean it's silly, really, all this talk of roping you and caging you and well

1097
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,140
我们不需要详谈
we don't need to go into the details.

1098
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:32,360
关键是你惹怒了这群乡亲们
The point is this angry mob of all a trouble you're in.

1099
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,480
这都可以一笔勾销
It can all go away.

1100
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,530
- 真的?  - 当然
- Really?  - Of course.

1101
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,330
你只需要向大家承认
All you have to do is admit to everyone

1102
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:47,090
那粒灰尘上没有什么小人国
that there are no little people living on that speck.

1103
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,820
承认你是错的 而我是对的
That you're wrong and I was right.

1104
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,270
你那样做了
You do that,

1105
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:57,440
一切就能像原来那样
and things can go the right back to the way they were.

1106
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:59,890
但如果你不那样做
But, if you don't,

1107
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,110
你就将为此付出代价
You're going to have to pay the price.

1108
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:14,000
我只需要说 这不是真的就行了?
So I just have to say it isn't true?

1109
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,640
随便你们! 把我捆起来! 把我关起来! 你们想怎么做都行!
Go ahead! Rope me! Cage me! Do whatever you want!

1110
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,910
But there are people on this speck.
但是这粒灰尘上确实有人

1111
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,410
And they have Mayor.
他们还有一名镇长

1112
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,280
他有96个女儿和一个叫做JoJo的儿子
Who has 96 daughters and one son name JoJo,

1113
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,290
他们共用一个卫生间 不管那是怎样的
Who all share a bathroom whatever that is.

1114
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,410
即使你们无法听到他们 看到他们
And even though you can't hear or see them at all,

1115
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:42,620
生命就是生命 不管有多渺小
Person's a person, no matter how small.

1116
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:52,800
That was beautiful, Horton.
那也很美好 Horton

1117
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,240
把他捆起来! 关起来!
Rope him! Cage him!

1118
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,350
把那粒灰尘丢到油锅里!
Burn that speck in a pot of boiling pees on that oil!

1119
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,610
他们不相信我们在这儿
They don't believe we're here.

1120
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,240
我们要弄出些声响!
We've got to make some noise!

1121

我们在这儿 我们在这儿 我们在这儿

01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,530
大家一起来!
Everybody!

1125
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,020
我们在这儿 我们在这儿 我们在这儿
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1126
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,200
这就是你编故事 说灰尘里住着人的代价!
This is what takes you never make up stories about people on specks!

1127
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,360
听啊 他们在说话!

1128
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,010
- 捆住他!  - 把他关起来!
- Rope him!  - Cage him!

1129
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:42,610
这不管用
It's not working.

1130
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,470
我能听见你们 但是他们的听力不够敏锐
I can hear you. But, their ears aren't strong enough.

1131
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,390
我们要更大声
We need to be louder.

1132
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:51,350
每个无名镇居民都要制造声响! 每个人!
Get every Who'd make noise! Everyone!

1133
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,940
我们在这儿 我们在这儿 我们在这儿

我们需要每个人的声音 JoJo!
We need every voice, JoJo!

01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:08,590
你得制造些声响 否则我们都完蛋了
You need to make some noise down there. Or we all be destroyed.

1137
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,720
镇长拿起鼓槌 开始敲鼓
The Mayor grabbed the tamtam starting to smack it.

1138
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,240
所有无名镇居民 都想方设法发出巨响
And all over Whoville, They ooped up all racket.

1139
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:22,070
他们敲着锡鼓 打着铜锅
They rattle tin kettles, they beat on brass pans,

1140
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,570
拍着垃圾桶盖 敲着旧酸莓罐子
On garbage-fill tops, old cranberry cans.

1141

他们吹响"哔哔叭叭铜号"

奏响"嘀嘀哒哒长笛"
On druming Soompazum, Boompazum, plutes

1143
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,160
好了!
There!

1144
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,950
现在他们能听见了吗?
Can they hear us now?

1145
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,940
听啊! 求你了!
Listen! Please!

1146
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,050
这是最美的声音!
It's the most beautiful thing ever!

1147
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,940
我什么没听到!
I don't hear nothing!

1148
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,830
我不这么想
I don't think so.

1149

再试试
But, keep trying.

我不会屈服的!
I'll never give...in!

你确定无名镇上每个无名氏都加入了吗?
Are you sure that every Who down in the Whoville is trying?

1152
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,980

1153
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,540
可能在老天文台
Probably up the old observatory.

Hey, there's our limit.

That one small extra yelp put it over.
那小小的 意外的一声叫喊结束了这一切

1176
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:40,970

01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:14,900
# 即使我迷惑彷徨 #
# And even as I wonder, #

1215
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,330
# I'll keep you in sight. #
# 我仍会注视着你 #

1216
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,080
# 你是窗内的烛光 #
#  Keeping in them sight. #

1217
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,260
- # 在寒冷的冬夜 #  - 比喻真巧妙
- # On a cool dark winter's night. #  - Beautiful metaphor.

1218
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:29,220
# 我比想象的还要接近你 #
# And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might. #

1219
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,910
哦 那个音调有点高了
Uh, that's a little high funny.

1220
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:37,170
# Baby, I can't fight this feeling any more. #
# 宝贝 我再也无法控制这感觉 #

1221
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:42,530
# 我忘记了我为什么开始奋斗 #
# I've forgotten what I started fighting for. #

1222
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:48,010
# 如果我不得不匍匐向前 #

1223
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:48,130
# And if I have to crawl upon the floor. #

1224
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,930
- # 冲进你的家门 #  - # 冲进你的家门 #
- # Come crashing through your door. #  - # Crashing through your door. #

1225
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:55,090
# Baby I can't fight this feeling any more. #
# 宝贝 我再也无法控制这感觉 #

1226
01:18:55,090 --> 01:19:04,330
# 我再也无法控制这感觉 #
# I can't fight this feeling any more. #

1227
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:09,670
对于霍顿与无名氏来说 故事结束得十分完满
And so all ended well for those Horton and Whos.

1228
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,640
对于丛林里的所有人 甚至包括袋鼠也同样如此
And for all in the jungle, even Kangaroos.

1229
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,930
So let that be a lesson to one and to all.
让我们每个人都认识这样一个道理吧

1230
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:18,120
生命就是生命
A person's a person.

1231
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,510
No matter how small.
无论其多么渺小
