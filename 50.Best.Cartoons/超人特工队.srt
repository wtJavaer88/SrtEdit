1
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,830
-这个开了吗?  -就这样
-Is this on? -That's fine.

2
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,030
我会穿墙破壁  却不会...
I can break through walls, I just can't...

3
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,630
-就这样  -却不会玩这个
-That's fine. -I can't get this on.

4
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,840
神奇超人...  你有保密的身份吗?
Mr. Incredible... Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,040
每个超级英雄都有保密的身份  我还不知道有谁不是这样
Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,550
谁愿意一直承担当超人的压力呢?
Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?

7
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,260
我当然有保密的身份啦
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,660
你以为会在超市里看见我穿成这样?  得了
Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,760
谁愿意用弹力女侠的身份去买东西  明白我的意思吗?
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, know what I mean?

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,170
那些女超人  总是想把自己的  保密身份告诉你
Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,580
她们觉得可以这样来套近乎
Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something.

12
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,520
我就说:
I said, 

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,080
"姑娘  我不想知道你那温柔的另一面"
"Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego or anything like that."

14
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,690
我是说  你告诉我你是  宇宙无敌超级霹雳小甜甜
I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

15
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,800
那就行了  我很满意  很满意
that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
不管你多少次拯救世界
No matter how many times you save the world,

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,610
它总是又会陷入危机
it always manages to get back in jeopardy again.

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,110
有时候我真想叫它消停一下  明白吗?
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know?

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,510
只要一会儿  我觉得自己像女佣一样  "我刚刚把这里收拾好
For a little bit. I feel like the maid. "I just cleaned up this mess.

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,020
咱们就不能让它干净个十分钟吗?  "
Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?"

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,020
我能理解
I could get to that point.

22
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,020
-"劳驾?  "  -还没结束呢
-"Please?" -We're not finished.

23
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,430
有时我觉得我就喜欢平平淡淡  的生活  你明白吗?
Sometimes I think I'd just like the simple life, you know?

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,030
稍微休息一下  安心养家
Relax a little and raise a family.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,340
退隐江湖?  你开玩笑吧?  我正在兴头上呢!
Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game!

26
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,040
我可是跻身大人物的行列!  姑娘们  来吧
I'm up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,750
把拯救世界的工作让给男人?  我可不同意
Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,250
我可不同意
I don't think so.

29
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,780
现在插播一条新闻
We interrupt for a bulletin.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,080
警方正在飞车追捕持枪歹徒
A high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway,

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,790
他们沿圣帕布洛大道向北行驶
traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,670
单独追捕

33
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,000
好啊  我有时间
Yeah, I've got time.

34
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,170
合作追捕  自动驾驶

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,670
拦截模式  转换

36
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,740
神奇超人  神奇超人
Mr. Incredible.

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,250
-怎么了  太太?  -我的猫  小喳喳  不肯下来
-What is it, ma'am? -My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

38
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,050
好的  建议您站远点  可能有麻烦
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble.

39
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,860
不会  他很乖的
No, he's quite tame.

40
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,980
快放手
Let go now.

41
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,800
谢谢你  神奇超人  你又成功了
Thank you, Mr. Incredible. You've done it again.

42

-你是最棒的  -不  只是刚好来这儿帮忙
-You're the best. -No, I'm just here to help.

43
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,510
各单位注意  发生了观光巴士抢劫案...
All units. We have a tour bus robbery...

44
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,110
观光巴士抢劫案  我还有时间

45
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,720
警官  太太  小喳喳

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,220
-酷!  准备出动!  -这是...?

47
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,020
-你到底是谁?  -我是神奇小子
-Who are you supposed to be? -I'm IncrediBoy.

48
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,630
什么?  不对
What? No.

49
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,930
你是那个追星族俱乐部的孩子
You're that kid from the fan club.

我一直对你们很和气  跟你们合影
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

53

在你们给我的每张纸上签名  可这...

打击犯罪的风格  最喜欢的口头禅  我全知道!

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,560

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,780
...看一个女人钱包里的东西  就可以对她了解许多
...you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse,

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,590
不过这也许不是你的目的
but maybe that's not what you had in mind.

61
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,190
-嘿  你瞧...
Hey, look...

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,700
弹力女侠
Elastigirl.

63
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,000
神奇超人
Mr. Incredible.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,310
-那没关系  我已经逮到他了  -当然啦  你已经逮到他了
-It's all right. I've got him. -Sure, you've got him.

65
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,510
-我只不过替你制住他  -没错  你干的
-I just took him out for you. -Sure, you did.

谢了  可我不需要帮忙
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,620
那"女士优先"怎么说?
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,830
那"男女平等"又怎么说?
Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?

71
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,530
喂  是这个小姐先逮到我的
Look, the lady got me first.

72
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,830
-好吧  我们可以分摊  -我是单干的
-Well, we could share, you know. -I work alone.

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,640
哦  那么我觉得你应该再多点...
Well, I think you need to be more...

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,540
...弹性
...flexible.

75
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,940
你待会儿有事吗?
Are you doing anything later?

76
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,650
我已经和人约好了
I have a previous engagement.

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,770
现在  你就呆在这儿吧
Now, you just stay here.

78
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,770
他们一般会在一小时内收拾垃圾的
They usually pick up the garbage in an hour.

79
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,470
-嘿  神奇超人!  -嘿  寒冰侠!
-Hey, Incredible! -Hey, Frozone!

80
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,180
-你还没准备好吗?  -我还有时间呢
-Shouldn't you be getting ready? -I still got time.

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,780
他要跳了
He's gonna jump!

82
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,910
你把我的骨头弄断了
I think you broke something.

83
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,810
等你接受心理治疗后  会原谅我的
With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me.

84
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,910
等一下
Wait a minute.

85
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,060
炸弹魔
Bomb Voyage.

86
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,600
神奇超人

87
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,160
还有神奇小子!
And IncrediBoy!

88
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,070
神奇小子?
IncrediBoy?

89
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,780
你不想知道我为什么来得这么快吗?  因为我穿了火箭靴
Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast? I have rocket boots.

90
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,570
-回家去  巴迪  快点  -什么?
-Go home, Buddy. Now. -What?

91
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,580
蠢小子...

92
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,980
我们能谈谈吗?
Can we talk?

93
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,180
你总说要坦诚面对你自己
You always say be true to yourself,

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,990
可你没说过是对哪一部分
but you never say which part to be true to.

95
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,460
好了  现在我终于想明白我是谁了 
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.

96
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,890
我是你的卫兵... 神奇小子!
 I am your ward... IncrediBoy!

97
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,000
可你现在走得太远了  巴迪
And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,400
因为我没有超能力  对吗?
This is because I don't have powers, isn't it?

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,510
你知道  不是每个超级英雄都有超能力的
Not every superhero has powers, you know.

100
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,510
没有超能力也可以当超人
You can be super without them.

101
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,010
我发明了这些东西  我能飞  你能飞吗?
I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?

102
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,480
那就飞回家去  巴迪  我是单干的
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,220
而且你的那套行头可笑至极!  

104
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,620
给我一次机会就行!  我会让你瞧瞧  我去找警察来
Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

105
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,230
-巴迪  不要!  -一会儿就行  真的
-Buddy, don't! -It'll only take a second, really.

106
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,330
停下!  有炸弹!
No, stop! There's a bomb!

107
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,440
放开  你把我的飞行模式搅乱了
Let go, you're wrecking my flight pattern.

108
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
-你要是放手我就能飞好!  -你就不能...?
-I can do this if you let go! -Will you just...?

109
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,840
-我是想帮你!  停下!  -别抓着我的披风!
-I'm trying to help! Stop! -Let go of my cape!

110
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,610
送这小子回家  一定要让她妈妈  知道他干的好事
Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he's been doing.

111
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,510
我能帮你  你是在铸成大...
I can help you. You're making a mist...

112
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,720
那个跳楼者受伤了  你们派  医护人员了吗?
The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?

113
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,820
他们把他带走了
They picked him up.

114
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,620
大楼里的爆炸是炸弹魔干的
The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage

115
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,230
他抢劫金库时被我撞上了
who I caught robbing the vault.

116
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,530
要是我们封锁这一带  也许能逮住他
We might nab him if we set up a perimeter.

117
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,530
-他逃掉了?  -嗯  是的
-He got away? -Well, yeah.

118
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,130
-都是因为这小淘气  -是神奇小子!
-Skippy here made sure of that. -IncrediBoy.

119
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,440
我跟你可没关系!  糟糕  我迟到了
You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late.

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,940
听着  我得马上到别处去
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

121
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,050
-那么炸弹魔呢?  -以后再说  我会去抓他的
-What about Bomb Voyage? -Any other night, I'd go after him,

122
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,460
不过现在我真得走了  别担心  我们会逮到他的!  总有一天!
but I really gotta go. Don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually!

123
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,470
-今晚还有时间吧?  -你迟到很久了
-Is the night still young? -You're very late.

124
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,170
-我看起来怎样?  还行吧?  -面具  你还戴着面具呢
-How do I look? Good? -The mask. You still got the mask.

125
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,580
好戏开场
Showtime.

126
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,790
罗伯特・帕尔  您愿意让这女子  成为你的合法妻子吗?
Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?

127
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,990
你迟到了  你那时问我待会儿有没有事
You're late. When you asked if I was doing anything later,

128
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,400
我还没想到是你忘记了  我以为你是在和我开玩笑呢
I didn't realize you'd forgotten. I thought it was playful banter.

129
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,900
-真的是玩笑  -你不觉得你把时间留得太紧了吗?
-It was. -Cutting it close, don't you think?

130
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,500
你需要再多点... 弹性
You need to be more... flexible.

131
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,910
我爱你  可要是我们想让这婚姻美满
I love you, but if we're gonna make this work,

132
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,210
你就不能光顾着当神奇超人
you've gotta be more than Mr. Incredible.

133
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,310
你愿意吗?
You know that. Don't you?

134
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,920
-...只要你们二人仍然在世?  -我愿意
-...so long as you both shall live? -I do.

135
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,120
我宣布这对新人结为夫妻
I pronounce this couple husband and wife.

136
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,230
只要我们都还在世  不管发生了什么事
As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens.

137
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,740
嘿  别逗了  我们是超级英雄啊  还能发生什么事?
Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen?

作为交换条件  他们承诺  再也不充当英雄的角色

-上面讲得很清楚...  -这  这个我付不起
-It states clearly... -I can't pay for this.

那么过去三年不算是因为...

-Why do we have so much junk? -Listen, I've got a client.

不用说了  拯救世界去吧  一次一张保单  亲爱的
Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey.

再见  亲爱的  不好意思  我们说到哪儿了?
Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we?

177
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,720
我是靠固定收入过日子的  要是你不能帮我
I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me,

178
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,320
我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'll do.

179
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,140
好吧  听好了  我是想帮你  可我办不到
All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I can't.

180
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,940
我很想告诉你拿一份保单的复印件  去找诺玛・威尔考克斯...
I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

181

Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can't.

I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form

183
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,460
然后交到二楼的法律部门
with our legal department on the second floor.

184
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,160
我估计也不会有什么人  能很快帮你解决问题的
I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter.

185
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,770
我很想帮你  但是我什么也做不了
I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do.

很高兴你能来  帕尔太太
I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr.

198
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,630
这是怎么了?  达什做错什么了?
What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong?

199
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,840
他是害群之马  他公然在全班  面前嘲弄我
He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class.

200
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,340
-他说的  -我知道是你干的!
-He says. -Look, I know it's you!

201
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,340
-他在我的椅子上放图钉  -你看见是他干的?
-He puts thumbtacks on my stool. -You saw him do this?

202
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,250
哦... 没有亲眼看见
Well... not really. No.

203
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,450
说实话  没有
Actually, not.

204
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,550
哦  那你怎么知道是他干的?
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

205
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,460
我藏了一台摄像机  对  这一次我算是逮到他了
I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

206
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,270
看见吗?  你们看见吗?
See? You see?

207
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,270
你们没看见?
You don't see it?

208
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,280
他动了!  就在那儿!
He moves! Right there!

209
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,980
等等  等等!  就在那儿!
Wait, wait! Right there!

210
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,790
就在我坐下去的时候!
Right as I'm sitting down!

211
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,590
我不知道他是怎么干的
I don't know how he does it,

212
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,990
可就在他动以前  那里没有钉子
but there's no tack before he moves

213
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,400
他一动  就有钉子了  是巧合吗?  我不信!
and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not!

214
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,910
-伯尼...  -别叫我"伯尼"
-Bernie... -Don't "Bernie" me.

215
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,010
这个小鬼头是坏蛋!
This little rat is guilty!

216
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,620
帕尔太太  您和您的儿子可以走了  抱歉给您添麻烦了
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble.

217
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,620
你又放他走了?  他是坏蛋!
You're letting him go again? He's guilty!

218
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,520
看他小脸的得意样就知道  坏蛋  我说了  坏蛋!
You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty!

219
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,840
达什  今年你是第三次  给叫到办公室了
Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office.

220
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,440
我们得找个更好的办法  更有建设性的办法
We need to find a better outlet. A more... constructive outlet.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,550
要是你让我去参加运动会  没准就行
Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports.

222
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,750
亲爱的  你知道我们为什么  不能那么做
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

223
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,460
我保证会有分寸的  我只会赢他们一点点
I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

224
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,760
达什尔・罗伯特・帕尔
Dashiell Robert Parr,

225
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,070
你是个特别争强好胜的孩子  还有一点爱卖弄
you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff.

226
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,270
你最禁不起诱惑
The last thing you need is temptation.

227
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,670
你老是说"尽力而为"  可你从来就不是那个意思
You always say, "Do your best." But you don't really mean it.

228
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,980
我能尽力的  为什么不让我尽力?
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

229
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,380
亲爱的  如今的世界只要我们  溶入其中
Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in,

230
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,180
为了溶入其中  我们就得  像其他所有人一样
and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else.

231
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,890
爸爸常说我们有超能力  没什么好难为情的
Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of.

232
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,890
-我们的超能力让我们很特别  -人人都很特别  达什
-Our powers made us special. -Everyone's special, Dash.

233
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,800
那也就是说没什么人是特别的
Which is another way of saying no one is.

234
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,910
莱丁杰  你上哪儿去?
Rydinger, where you headed?

235
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
-嗨  托尼  -嘿

-嘿  托尼  可以帮你拿书吗?  -那可有点好笑
-Hey, Tony, can I carry your books? -That's kind of funny.

嘿  托尼  你打橄榄球吗?
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

238
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,140
托尼  我们去游泳吧
Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming.

239
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,840
他看了我一眼
He looked at me.

240
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,150
-快点  薇奥莱特!
Come on, Violet!

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,080

00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,050
-你又在做鬼脸  -才没有

245
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,550
你做鬼脸了  亲爱的
You make weird faces, honey.

246

-你非得在饭桌上看吗?  -啊哈  是的
-Do you have to read at the table? -Uh-huh. Yeah.

247
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,160
小口咬  达什  呀!
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

248
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,370
鲍勃  帮这个小肉桶把肉切一下吧?
Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat.

249
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,670
达什  有什么学校里的事  要跟爸爸说吗?
Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school?

250
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,580
-哦  我们解剖了一只青蛙  -达什又给叫到办公室去了
-Well, we dissected a frog. -Dash got sent to the office again.

251
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,180
-很好  很好  -不  鲍勃  这不好
-Good. Good. -No, Bob, that's bad.

252
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,390
-什么?  -达什又给叫到办公室去了
-What? -Dash got sent to the office again.

253
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,290
-什么?  为什么?  -没什么
-What?! What for? -Nothing.

254
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,290
他在老师的椅子上放图钉...  是在上课的时候
He put a tack on the teacher's chair... during class.

255
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,100
没人看见  你在录像带上  都很难看出来
Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape.

256
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,300
他们给你拍了录像带可还是  让你逃过了?  哇!
They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa!

257
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,910
你准是一直在练  你的动作有多快?
You must have been booking. How fast were you going?

258
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,610
我们不是要鼓励他这么干
We are not encouraging this.

259
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,710
没有啊  我只是问有多快...
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

260
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,710
-亲爱的!

所以我就有大麻烦了
So now I'm in deep trouble.

308
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,840
我是说  要是再来上一道死光  我就要进棺材了
I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I'm an epitaph.

309
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,140
好在我总算找到了躲的地方  然后无情男爵怎么做?
Somehow I managed to find cover. What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

310
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,150
-他开始长篇大论  -他开始长篇大论
-He starts monologuing. -He starts monologuing.

他开始发表早就准备好的演讲  说我跟他比起来怎么怎么弱
He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him.

这家伙打得我没脾气  而且还说个没完
I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up.

-想去抓强盗吗?  -不想
-Want to catch a robber? -No.

319
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,880
实话跟你说吧  我宁可去打保龄球
Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling.

320
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,940
你说  要是我们真的去干我们的 
Look, what if we actually 

321
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,490
老婆以为我们在干的事情  那不好吗?
did what our wives think we're doing?

322
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,090
就算是平衡一下
Just to shake things up.

323
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,900
他不是一个人  那个大块头还和他在一起
He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him.

324
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,300
他们一直在说话
They're just talking.

325
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,500
-我们在这里算是干什么?  -保护别人

326
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,910
-没人求我们保护  -你想要别人请你?
-Nobody asked us. -You need an invitation?

327
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,610
想啊  对  我们一直偷偷摸摸  地干这种事...
I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...

328
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,120
-你记得激光眼吗?  -报上提到过他
-You remember Gazerbeam? -There was something in the paper.

329
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,420
-他也过不惯小老百姓的生活  -你什么时候看见他的?
-He had trouble with civilian life. -When did you see him?

330
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,030
以前的老伙计我都没看见  只有你
I don't see anyone from the old days. Just you.

331
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,330
-现在我们又是这样来赌运气  -得了
-And we're pushing our luck as it is. -Come on.

332
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,230
第一次是很好玩  可要是我们  一直这么干...
It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this...

333
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,740
-我们接到火灾报告...  -火灾  我们离那儿很近!
-We have a report on a fire... -A fire. We're close!

334
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,640
-好啊  宝贝!  -我们会给逮住的
-Yeah, baby! -We're gonna get caught.

335

火灾!  好啊!
Fire! Yeah!

336
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,160
-所有人都在这儿了?  -对
-Is that everybody? -Yeah.

337
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,770
-最好是这样  -你就不能把这火灭了吗?
-It better be. -Can't you put this out?

338
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,180
我做不出足够厚的冰!  它蒸发得太快了!
I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too fast!

339
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,380
-这是什么意思?  -意思是这里太热了
-What's that mean? -It means it's hot.

340
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,780
-我都给烤干了  鲍勃  -你的冰用完了?
-I'm dehydrated, Bob. -You're out of ice?

341
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,190
你不可能用完的  你连空气里的水都能用
You can't run out. You can use water in the air.

342
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,090
这种空气里没有水!  你又有什么借口  把肌肉用完了?
There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

343
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,100
我不能把墙打破  这幢楼快撑不住了
I can't smash walls. The building's getting weaker.

344
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,500
-它会砸到我们头顶上的  -我想去打保龄球的!
-It's gonna come down on top of us. -I wanted to go bowling!

345
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,910
好吧!  跟紧了!  会很热的!
All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!

346
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,740
哦  很好
Oh, good.

347
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,450
不对劲啊
That ain't right.

348
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,050
-我们看起来就像三流坏蛋!  -你可以从空气里取水了
-We look like incompetent bad guys! -You can get water out of the air.

349
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,850
别动!
Freeze!

350
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,560
别动!
Freeze!

351
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,470
-我口渴  -我说了别动!
-I'm thirsty. -I said freeze!

352
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,670
我只是喝点水
I'm just getting a drink.

353
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,680
-你已经喝过了  现在...  -我知道  我知道  冰冻!
-You've had your drink. Now... -I know. I know. Freeze.

354
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,090
警察!
Police officers!

355
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,710
这次真是太险了
That was way too close.

356
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,710
咱们再也不能这么干了
We are not doing that again.

357
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,320
你确认要换目标吗?  完毕
Verify you want to switch targets? Over.

358
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,130
相信我  这就是他一直在找的人
Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for.

359
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,170
-我以为你最晚11点能回来  -我说了会晚点回来
-I thought you'd be back by 11. -I said I'd be back later.

360
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,970
我是以为你会晚一点回来  只要你最后还是回来了...
I assumed you'd be back later. If you came back at all...

361
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,280
-...就算是"晚点回来"  -好了  我已经回来了  行了吧?
-...you'd be "back later". -Well, I'm back, okay?

362
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,790
这是碎石吧?
Is this rubble?

363
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,390
稍微练习一下而已  免得身体僵掉了
It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose.

364
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
你知道我是怎么想的  真是的!  我们不能再暴露身份了
You know how I feel about that. Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

365
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,200
-总之是因为那幢楼塌了  -什么?
-The building was coming down anyway. -What?

366
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,910
你把一幢楼弄塌了?
You knocked down a building?

367
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,910
它着火了  结构不牢了  所以就塌了
It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down.

368
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,410
你又在偷听警方频道?
Have you been listening to the police scanner again?

369
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,720
我是在为人民服务  你好像觉得那是坏事一样
I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing.

370
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,220
那就是坏事  鲍勃!
It is a bad thing, Bob!

371
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,140
为了你能重新体验那些光辉岁月
Uprooting our family again, 

372
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,330
就害得我们搬家  这就是坏事
so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing.

373
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,330
总比假装那些事没有发生过要强!
It's better than acting like they didn't happen!

374
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,830
对!  它们是发生过!  可是我们家里的事
Yes! They happened! But this, our family,

375
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,540
才是正在发生的事  鲍勃  你却一点不关心!
is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this!

376
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,740
我真是不敢相信你不想参加  儿子的毕业典礼
I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation.

377
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,350
那不算毕业  他只是从四年级升五年级
It's not a graduation. He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

378
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,350
-那也是一次典礼!  -那是有病!
-It's a ceremony! -It's psychotic!

379
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,160
他们一直在变着法子表扬平庸之才
They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity

380
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
可要是出了什么不同寻常的人...
but if someone is exceptional...

381
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,460
这不是你自己的事  鲍勃  是达什的事
This is not about you, Bob. It's about Dash.

382
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,370
你想替达什做点事吗?  那就让他真正去竞争
You want to do something for Dash? Let him actually compete.

383
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,270
-让他去参加运动会!  -我也不想当恶人!
-Let him go out for sports! -I will not be made the enemy!

384
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,170
-你知道我们为什么不能那样做  -因为他会大获成功
-You know why we can't do that. -Because he'd be great.

385
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,580
这不是你自己的事!
This is not about you!

386
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,480
好吧  达什  我知道你在听  出来吧
All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out.

387
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,790
小薇  你也是  出来吧  小姑娘

389
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,000
没什么  孩子们  我们只不过在讨论
It's okay, kids. We're just having a discussion.

390
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,900
讨论得很大声
Pretty loud discussion.

391
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,600
不过那没关系  重要的是  妈妈和我一直是战友
But that's okay. What's important is that Mommy and I are a team.

392
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,410
-我们团结一致  共同对抗...  -老顽固?
-We're united, uh, against forces of... -Pigheadedness?

393
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,020
-我想说邪恶来着  -对不起  把你们吵醒了
-I was gonna say evil. -We're sorry we woke you.

394
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,420
没什么事  去睡觉吧  已经很晚了
Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late.

395
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,620
-晚安  妈妈  晚安  爸爸  -晚安
-Good night, Mom. Night, Dad. -Good night.

396
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,430
其实我们都该去睡了
In fact, we should all be in bed.

397
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,750
索赔请求  索赔号158183...
Request claim on claim numbers 158183...

398
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,660
你还没把他找来?  他在哪儿?
Haven't you got him yet? Where is he?

399
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,360
哈夫先生要你到他办公室谈谈
Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office.

400
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,760
-现在?  -现在

401
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,490
坐  鲍勃
Sit down, Bob.

402
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,210
我很不开心  鲍勃  很不开心
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

403

-问我为什么呀  -好吧  为什么?

什么为什么?  说具体点  鲍勃
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

405
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,210
为什么你不开心?
Why are you unhappy?

406
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,120
你的客户让我不开心
Your customers make me unhappy.

407
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,920
什么  你接到投诉了?
What, you've gotten complaints?

408
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,520
投诉我倒能应付
Complaints I can handle.

409
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,230
可我不能应付的是你的客户  对我们公司内部运作方式
What I can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge

410
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,230
竟然了如指掌!  他们都是专家  专家!
of lnsuricare's inner workings! They're experts. Experts, Bob!

411
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,440
他们会利用每一个漏洞  绕开  每一个障碍!
Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle!

412
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,040
他们完全看穿了我们的制度!
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

413
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,850
-我做了什么不合规定的事吗?  -没有
-Did I do something illegal? -No.

414
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:08,250
-你能说我们不该帮助客户吗?  -法律要求我对此回答"否"
-We shouldn't help our customers? -The law requires that I answer no.

415
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,560
-我们应该帮助人们  -应该帮助我们的人!
-We're supposed to help people. -Help our people!

416
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,460
从我们的股东开始
Starting with our stockholders.

417
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,160
谁在帮他们解决困难呢  唔?
Who's helping them out, huh?

418
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,270
你知道  鲍勃  一家公司...
You know, Bob, a company...

419
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,970
就好比一台巨大的时钟
Is like an enormous clock.

420
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,080
...就好比一台...  说得对  非常正确
...is like an enormous... Yes. Precisely.

421
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,780
只有当每一个小齿轮都紧密咬合  它才能工作
It only works if all the little cogs mesh together.

422
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:38,290
那么  时钟需要清洗  加润滑油  和上紧发条
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight.

423
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:44,000
一流的时钟有着按设计  密切配合的轴承和齿轮
The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

424
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,410
我是在打比方  鲍勃  知道我在用齿轮比喻什么?
I'm being metaphorical, Bob. Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

425
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,210
鲍勃?
Bob?

426
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,410
鲍勃?  我跟你说话的时候  你要看着我  帕尔
Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr.

-外面那个人  他需要帮助  -不要改变话题
-That man out there, he needs help. -Don't change the subject.

428
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,520
-我们现在讨论的是你的态度  -他正被人抢!
-We're discussing your attitude. -He is getting mugged!

429
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,330
-哦  那么但愿我们不用赔他钱  -我马上回来
-Well, let's hope we don't cover him. -I'll be right back.

430
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,230
给我站住  要不就解雇你!
Stop right now or you're fired!

431
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,840

Close the door.

Get over here, now.

433
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,260
我很不开心  鲍勃  很不开心
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

434
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,960
-他跑了  -那也很好嘛
-He got away. -Good thing, too.

435
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,870
你差一点就丢了你的...
You were this close to losing your...

436
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,490
请立刻前往722手术室报到
Please report to operating room 722 immediately.

-How is he? -He'll live.

438
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
-我被解雇了  是吗?  -你说呢?
-I'm fired, aren't I? -You think?

439
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,210
-我还能说什么  瑞克?  -能说的你以前都说过了
-What can I say, Rick? -Nothing you haven't said before.

440
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,310
-有个人遇到麻烦了  -有个人总是遇到麻烦
-Someone was in trouble. -Always.

441
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,010
-我不得不做一些事  -每次你说这话
-I had to do something. -Every time you say that,

442
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,220
我就要忙上一个半月
it's a month and a half of trouble for me.

443
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,620
用掉纳税人的几十万块钱
Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars.

444
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,320
-我知道  -我们花钱封住这些公司的嘴
-I know. -We pay to keep the company quiet.

445
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,530
我们赔偿损失  消除记忆  重新安置你的家人
We pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family.

446
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,130
一次比一次困难  钱啊钱啊钱
Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money.

447
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,240
我们也不能老这么干  我们很  感激你在当年做的事
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate what you did in the old days,

448
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,940
可那种时候已经过去了  从现在起  你得自力更生了
but those days are over. From now on, you're on your own.

449
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,360
听着鲍勃  也许我还能再安置你一次 
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, 

450
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,350
你知道  看在过去的份上
you know, for old times' sake.

451
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,560
我不能对我的家人那样做  他们都刚刚安顿下来

我要离开几天

万能机器人9000  是一台绝密的战斗机器人原型机
The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot.

509

它的人工智能使它能够解决
lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem

510
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,850
遇到的任何问题  不幸的是...

511
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,550
让我猜一下  它已经聪明到  不肯服从命令了
Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders.

512
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,720
我们失去了对它的控制 
We lost control. 

513
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,260
现在它就在  丛林里游荡  威胁着我们的设施
Now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility.

514
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,860
为了安全  我们只好撤走岛上所有人
We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety.

515
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,960
我要怎么进入?
How am I going in?

516
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,870
考虑到万能机器人的防御能力  我们只能从5000英尺空投
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet.

517
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,470
它的隐形装置使我们很难跟踪它
lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track.

518
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,880
可以肯定的是它正在岛的南半部份
We're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island.

519
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,680
还有一点  显然我们对它投资很大
One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment.

520
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,090
你要我在不摧毁它的情况下把他关掉

521
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,890
你是神奇超人嘛
You are Mr. Incredible.

522
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,520
我必须警告你  它是学习型机器人
I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot.

523
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,230
你和它战斗的时间越长  它就越能了解该怎样击败你
Every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you.

524
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,630
关掉它  动作要快  不能摧毁它
Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it.

525
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,440
-还有  不要死  -好极了  谢谢
-And don't die. -Great. Thanks.

526
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,080
好戏开场

527
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,160
啊  我的腰!
Oh, my back!

528
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,660
出乎意料  我们一定要把他带回来
Surprising. We must bring him back.

529
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,770
解除警报  请他来吃晚餐
Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner.

530
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,100
最要紧的是不要让他看出来
Most important, keep things light.

531
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,300
夸他一下  让他感到我们  很欣赏他的能力
Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities.

532
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,710
我是不是穿得太正式了?
Am I overdressed?

533
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,610
说实话  你穿得很时髦
Actually, you look rather dashing.

534
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,510
-我想我们的雇主...  -抱歉
-I take it our host is... -I'm sorry.

535
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,920
他不想和我们共进晚餐  他希望你能理解
He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll understand.

536
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,620
当然  但我通常比较想知道为谁工作
Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I'm working for.

537
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,530
他喜欢保持一点神秘感
He prefers a certain amount of anonymity.

538
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,230
当然了  你是能理解的
Surely, you of all people understand that.

539
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,660
我只是不明白  有那么多地方可以 
I was just wondering, of all the places

540
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,940
住  为什么偏偏选择住在...
 to settle down, why live...

541
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,340
火山边?  他迷恋力量  我也是
With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am I.

542
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,250
-这是我们共有的弱点  -看来有点不牢靠
-It's a weakness we share. -Seems a bit unstable.

543
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,550
我希望你这种看法是因为误解
I prefer to think of it as misunderstood.

544
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,160
我们不都这样吗?
Aren't we all?

545
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,960
火山土是地球上最肥沃的土壤之一
Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth.

546
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,160
这桌上的东西都是这里长的
Everything at the table was grown right here.

547
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,770
-你觉得怎样?  -全都很可口
-How does it compare? -Everything's delicious.

548
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,790
-天啊  -快点  亲爱的
-Jeez. -Hurry, honey.

549
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,100
你上班要迟到了
Or you'll be late for work.

550
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,500
-祝你工作顺利  亲爱的  -谢谢
-Have a great day, honey. -Thanks.

551
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,500
-伺候好客户  努力往上爬...  -还要养好家
-Help customers, climb ladders... -Bring bacon.

552
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,310
就是这样
All that jazz.

553
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,620
你预约了吗?
You have an appointment?

554
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,920
我是老朋友  我只想...
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

555
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,430
-所有访客都必须...  -走开  检查电网去
-All visitors are required... -Go check the electric fence.

556
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,830
怎么回事?  你是谁?  想干什么?
What is it? Who are you? What do you want?

557
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,140
天啊  你发福了  进来吧  快  快
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come.

558
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,850
是啊  一切都很好  都很好  上帝啊  没什么可抱怨的
Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints.

559
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,360
不过你知道  和以前不一样了  完全不一样了
But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all.

560
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,170
你不是还上过电视吗?  是什么演出  在布拉... 布拉格?
Weren't you in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague?

561
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,170
米兰  亲爱的  是米兰
Milan, darling. Milan.

562
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,270
超级名模  她们根本  没什么超级的地方
Supermodels. Nothing super about them.

563
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,780
任性  愚蠢  瘦得像火柴棒
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

564
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,380
总是浓妆艳抹  只会为自己着想的家伙
with poofy lips who think only about themselves.

565
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,590
切!  我以前可是为诸神设计服装的
Feh! I used to design for gods.

566
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:04,300
不过也许你要来求我?  接到你的电话我可是吃了一惊呢
But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call.

567
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,200
E  我只要你帮我补一下
E, I just need a patch job.

568
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,500
唔  这是超网眼式的  过时了  不过很结实
Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy.

569
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,910
你却把它扯破了!  你到底在干什么  罗伯特?
And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert?

570
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,410
月下扮英雄?
Moonlighting hero work?

571
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,520
那肯定是很久以前的事了
Must have happened a long time ago.

572
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,720
明白了  这是叫花子穿的
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

573
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,520
你可不能穿这个出门  我不允许!
You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it!

574
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,530
十五年前可能允许  可现在嘛―― 
Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?

575
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,630
你是什么意思?  这可是你设计的
 -What do you mean? You designed it.

576
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,840
我永远不看从前的作品  那只会影响现在的工作
I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now.

577
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,640
你需要一套新衣服  这是可以肯定的
You need a new suit. That much is certain.

578
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,240
新衣服?  我到底上哪儿能弄到新衣服?
A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit?

579
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,750
你弄不到的!  不可能!  我又太忙了
You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy.

580
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,050
所以快点求我吧  趁我还没有恢复理智
So ask me now, before I again become sane.

581
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,950
等等  你想给我做套新衣服?
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

582
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,660
你也太过分了  亲爱的!  不过我接受
You push too hard, darling! But I accept.

583
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,560
-它的设计会很大胆  很惹眼!  -好
-It will be bold. Dramatic! -Yeah.

584
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,870
-很高雅!  -对  经典的衣服  就像劲爆侠!
-Heroic! -Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

585
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,280
哦!  他可真帅!  那披风  还有靴子...
Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots...

586
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,580
不能加披风!
No capes!

587
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,580
-不是该听我的吗?  -你记得霹雳头吗?
-Isn't that my decision? -Do you remember Thunderhead?

588
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,490
高个子  能驾驭暴风雨  是个好人  跟孩子们很合得来
Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids.

589
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,690
-听我说  E...  -58年11月15号
-Listen, E... -November 15th of '58.

590
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,300
本来一切顺利  可是他的披风却被  导弹尾翼挂住了
All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

591
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,610
霹雳头不是很聪明...
Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb...

592
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,710
风云女!
Stratogale!

593
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:29,010
57年4月23号  披风被  吸进发动机叶片里
April 23rd, '57. Cape caught in a jet turbine.

594
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,420
你不能以偏概全
You can't generalize about these things.

595
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,820
中元侠  在高速电梯上出事  劲爆侠  起飞时被钩住
Meta-man. Express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

596
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,030
天外飞降  被卷进旋风里  不能加披风!
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes!

597
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,230
好了  你的新衣服会在下次任务  以前做好的
Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment.

598
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,340
你知道我已经不当英雄了
You know I'm retired from hero work.

599
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,240
和我一样  罗伯特  可你  还不是又来找我了?
As am I, Robert. Yet, here we are.

600
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,150
E  我只需要把衣服补一下  为了怀旧
E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons.

601
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,250
好吧  我也会把叫花子衣服补好的
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

602
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:01,060
-你是绝顶高手  E  -对  我知道  亲爱的  我知道
-You're the best of the best, E. -Yes, I know, darling. I know.

603
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,280
别接  亲爱的  我来听!
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

604
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,390
-喂?  -我们有新任务要给你

-See you there. -Goodbye.

607
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,500
谁打来的?  是...公司的人吗?

611
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,930
-祝你... 祝你旅途愉快  -谢谢  甜心
-Ha... have a great trip. -Thanks, sweetie.

612
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,440
-我到的时候会给你打电话的  -我爱你
-I'll call you when I get there. -I love you.

613
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,040
-很爱很爱  -我也爱你啊
-So much. -I love you too.

614
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,960
我是您的自动机长
This is your automated Captain.

615
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,270
您还想要香槟加橙汁吗?
Would you care for more mimosa?

616
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,670
-我要是想的话  你可别介意  谢谢  -别客气

海伦・帕尔  你知道的...
Helen Parr? You know...

629
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,150
弹力女侠
Elastigirl?

630
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,460
亲爱的!  都过去这么多年了!  真是太久了!
Darling! It's been such a long time after all these years! So long!

631
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,260
是有段日子了
It's been a while.

632
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,970
鲍勃只会放心让一个人给他补  超人服  那个人就是你
There's only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit. That's you.

633
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,170
对  对  对  很棒吧  是吗?
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

634
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,970
比他从前穿的那些难看睡衣强多了
Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear.

635
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,780
我已经都做好了  你什么时候过来看?
They are finished. When are you coming to see?

636
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,280
-我打电话来是为了...  -不要让我求你
-I'm calling about... -Don't make me beg.

637
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,730
我不会求人的  你知道 
I won't do it, you know. 

638
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,190
求你?  不  我打电话来是为了衣服的事
Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

639
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,190
是  是为了鲍勃的衣服!  我打电话来是为了鲍勃的衣服
Bob's suit! I'm calling about Bob's suit.

640
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,910
你一小时以内来吧  亲爱的 
You come in one hour, darling. 

641
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:00,300
说定了  好吗?  好的  再见
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

642
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
它更大!
It's bigger!

643
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,150
它更坏!
It's badder!

644
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:42,550
女士们先生们  神奇超人打不过它!
Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

645
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,160
终于可以了
It's finally ready.

646
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,270
你知道吗  我用好多超级英雄磨炼它  好让它能够跟你打
You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you,

647
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,370
可是  它还是不够强!
but man, it wasn't good enough!

648
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:58,480
在你打坏上一个以后  我只好  再对它做一些大修改
After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications.

649
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,880
当然这很困难  不过为了你  值得这么干
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

650
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,290
再怎么说  我也是你的头号崇拜者
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

651
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:10,900
-巴迪?  -我不叫巴迪!
-Buddy? -My name is not Buddy!

652
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,100
也不叫神奇小子!
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

653
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,800
那已经过去了  那时候我心里想的只是帮你
That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you.

654
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,410
我只想要帮忙!  可你对我说了什么呢?
I only wanted to help! And what did you say to me?

655
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,110
那就飞回家去  巴迪  我是单干的
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

656
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:26,720
我的心都被撕碎了  不过我也学到了重要的一课
It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson.

657
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,120
不能相信任何人
You can't count on anyone.

658
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,120
尤其是你的英雄
Especially your heroes.

659
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,230
我那样对你是错了  我很抱歉
I was wrong to treat you that way. I'm sorry.

660
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,630
瞧见了吗?  现在你知道尊重我了  因为我对你是威胁
See? Now you respect me, because I'm a threat.

661
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,330
天下的事情就是这样
That's the way it works.

662
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,240
世上有许多人想得到尊重
There's a lot of people, whole countries who want respect.

663
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,140
可他们要付出很高的代价才能得到
And they will pay through the nose to get it.

664
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,850
你知道我是怎么发财的?  我发明武器
How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons.

665
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:52,350
现在我有了一部只有我自己才能  打败的武器  如果我开动它  就会...
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I'll get...

666
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,760
你这老狐狸!  你引诱我发表长篇大论
You sly dog! You got me monologuing.

667
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,060
我真是不能相信
I can't believe it.

668
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,270
很酷吧?  是零点能
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

669
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,470
我把最好的发明留给自己用
I save the best inventions for myself.

670
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,480
我现在够强了吧?
Am I good enough now?

671
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,380
现在谁才是超人?
Who's super now?

672
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,580
我是万恶霸王!  是你的冤家对头和...
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

673
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,190
哦  很好!
Oh, brilliant!

674
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,720
好吧  试试这个是不是够劲
All right, try this one on for size, big boy.

675
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,270
激光眼
Gazerbeam.

676
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,590
Kronos?
"Kronos?"

677
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,130
生命读数为负  神奇超人已被消灭
Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible terminated.

678
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:06,040
这个项目耗费了我毕生的精力
This project has completely confiscated my life, darling.

679
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,190
只有英雄的工作才能这样吸引我 
Consumed me as only hero work can. 

680
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,450
我得承认  这是我最好的作品
My best work, I must admit.

681
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,350
简洁  优雅  又大胆  你会非常喜欢的
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

682
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,560
-E  我只要...  -我做好了罗伯特的衣服
-E, I just... -I did Robert's suit,

683
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,260
因为它实在太美了  我只好接着做下去
and it turned out so beautiful, I had to continue.

684
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,270
见到你真是很高兴  可我不  明白你在说什么
It's great to see you, but I have no idea what you're talking about.

685
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,570
-我只要...  -对  语言是无用的
-I just... -Yes, words are useless.

686
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,570
真要说起来话就太长了  亲爱的  太长了!
Gobble, gobble, gobble. Too much of it, darling. Too much!

687
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,780
所以才要让你亲眼看我的作品
That is why I show you my work.

688
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,880
所以你才会来这儿
That is why you are here.

689
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,690
埃德娜模式
Edna Mode.

690
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,100
还有客人

692
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,830
-加奶油和糖?  -谢谢
-Cream and sugar? -Thanks.

693
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,540
-我就从小宝宝开始  -开始?
-I started with the baby. -Started?

694
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,750
安静点  亲爱的! 
Shh! Darling! 

695
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,640
我把它裁得稍微  宽松点  好让他能自由活动
I cut it a little roomy for the free movement.

696
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,050
这种布料可以让娇嫩的皮肤感到  非常舒适
The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin,

697
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,750
还能经受住1000度以上的高温
and can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

698
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,860
绝对防弹
Completely bulletproof.

699
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,460
而且可以机洗  亲爱的  这可是新增加的特性
And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature.

700
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,470
你到底以为小宝宝会去干什么?
What on earth do you think the baby will be doing?

701
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,880
哦  可以肯定的是我不知道  有备无患嘛
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the prepared.

702
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,180
我不知道小宝宝的超能力是什么  所以只包含了基本功能
I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics.

703
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,580
-杰杰根本没有超能力  -没有吗?
-Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers. -No?

704
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,990
反正他穿上以后会让你大吃一惊
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

705
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:55,390
我把你儿子的衣服设计为可以  承受巨大的摩擦
Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction

706
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,800
同时不会升温或破损  很有用的功能
without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature.

707
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,500
你女儿的衣服很巧妙
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

708
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,260
我终于开发出一种耐用的材料 
I finally created a sturdy material

709
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,310
可以在她隐身时和她一起消失
 that will disappear completely as she does.

710
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,820
你的衣服可以在不伤到你自己  的情况下  尽可能地伸长
Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself,

711
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,830
而且还能恢复原状
and still retain its shape.

712
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:21,430
几乎是坚不可摧...
Virtually indestructible...

713
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,140
...但又和埃及棉一样透气
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

714
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,640
每套衣服都附带了导航设备
As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device,

715
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,250
你只要按一下按钮就可以知道  穿戴者的精确地理坐标
giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button.

716
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,750
好了  亲爱的  你怎么想?
Well, darling? What do you think?

717
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:41,660
我怎么想?  鲍勃已经洗手不干了!  我也不干了!
What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired!

718
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,460
我们全家都在隐居
Our family is underground.

719
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,970
你又背着我让我丈夫重操旧业?
You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?

720
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,170
哦  我还以为你知道呢  亲爱的
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

721
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:52,170
为什么他会对你保密?
Why would he keep secrets from you?

722
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:55,280
他不会  以前没有  现在也没有
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

723
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,890
男人在罗伯特这个年纪总是  很不牢靠
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

724
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,190
容易产生弱点
Prone to weakness.

725
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,690
-你在说什么?  -你知道他在哪儿吗?
-What are you saying? -Do you know where he is?

726
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:08,800
-当然  -你知道他在哪儿吗?
-Of course. -Do you know where he is?

727
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:43,130
-嘿  我们有人受伤了!  -快点  咱们过去
-Hey, hey. We got a man down! -Come on, let's go.

你还好吧?  出什么事了?

the number of the hotel he's staying at? The number I have is no good.

734
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,310
-帕尔先生已经不在这里工作了  -你说什么?
-Mr. Parr no longer works here. -What do you mean?

735
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,910

What makes you think it's special?

798

01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:47,730
正好一起去的  对
At the same time. Yeah.

809
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:04,250
你  先生  真是"神奇超人"
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".

810
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,250
我以前崇拜你是对的
I was right to idolize you.

811
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,860
我早就知道你是硬汉  可你居然会躲在另一个超人的骨头后面
I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe

812
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:12,860
骗过探测器?  哦  老兄!
by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man!

813
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,570
我现在想起来还是觉得佩服!
I'm still geeking out about it!

814
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:20,170
可接下来你就不够意思了
And then you had to just go and ruin the ride.

815
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:25,280
神奇超人居然呼救?  "救救我  救救我"
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help? "Help me, help me."

816
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,780
丢脸  丢脸  丢脸
Lame, lame, lame.

817
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,790
-好吧  你找的是谁?  -找谁?  你在说什么?
-All right, who did you contact? -Contact? What are you talking about?

818
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,000
我说的是昨晚23:07
I am referring to last night at 23:07 hours

819
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,200
在你到处偷窥的时候  你发出了一个  导航信号
while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal.

820
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,360
我不知道导航装置的事
I didn't know about the homing device.

821
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,760
现在有一架政府的飞机请求在这里降落
And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here.

822
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,530
-你找的是谁?  -我没有叫飞机来
-Who did you contact? -I didn't send for a plane.

823
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,630
把通话录音放给他听
Play the transmission.

824
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:05,140
-IG99请求准入  -海伦! 
-India golf checking in. -Helen!

825
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:08,340
这么说你认识这帮人
So you do know these people.

826
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,440
好吧  那我就小小地问候他们一下
Well, then, I'll send them a little greeting.

827
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,850
-噢!  -薇奥莱特!
-Ow! -Violet!

828
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,150
不是我的错
It's not my fault.

829
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,560
是达什偷跑出来  我知道  你肯定要为这事骂我
Dash ran away, I knew I'd get blamed for it.

830
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,260
不是这样的!
That's not true!

831
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,260
是你说:"妈妈好像有点事  我们一定要弄明白"
You said, "Something's up with Mom. We have to find out what.

832
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,970
-...这不是我的错!  -百分之百都是你的主意!
-...and it's not my fault! -Hundred percent all-yours idea!

833
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,970
等一下  你们把杰杰一个人扔下了?
Wait a minute. You left Jack-Jack alone?

834
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,880
-我们当然找人代看了  -我们找了人的  妈妈
-Of course we got a sitter. -We got someone, Mom.

835
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,280
-我们不会让他一人在家的  -多谢了!
-We wouldn't do that. -Thanks a lot!

836
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,480
好吧  你们找的是谁?
All right, well, who'd you get?

837
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,990
你什么也不用担心
You don't have to worry about one thing.

838
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:45,390
我天生就会带孩子  还上过课  学过心肺复苏术
I've got baby-sitting wired. I've taken courses, learned CPR,

839
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:48,800
-成绩优秀  还拿了证书  -凯莉
-excellent marks and certificates. -Kari.

840
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,100
我带了莫扎特的音乐  在他睡觉时放
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

841
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,200
因为专家说莫扎特的音乐能让  宝宝更聪明
because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter.

842
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,410
凯莉...
Kari...

843
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:58,310
妙就妙在他们不一定要听  因为他们是睡着的! 
The beauty is they don't have to listen 'cause they're asleep!

844
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,310
要是我爸妈当年放过莫扎特就好了
I wish my parents played Mozart

845
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,520
因为不管什么人说话  我总有一半  时间听不懂他们说什么
because half the time I don't know what anyone's talking about.

846
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,020
凯莉  这事我真觉得不太好
Kari, I really don't feel comfortable with this.

847
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,230
给你惹的麻烦我会补偿的  不过我还是想叫服务公司来
I'll pay you for your trouble, but I'd rather call a service.

848
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:12,130
真的没有必要  帕尔太太
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

849
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,930
宝宝有什么事我全能对付
I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out.

850
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,740
对不对  小宝宝?  我能对付的
Can't I, little baby? I can handle it.

851
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:20,040
-谁能对付呀?
Who can handle it?

852
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,260
IG99报告误击
India Golf niner-niner transmitting in the blind guard.

853
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,460
取消攻击  重复  取消攻击
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

854
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,900
重复  取消攻击  这是友机...
Repeat, disengage. Friendlies...

855
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,310
不!  快取消导弹攻击  要我  做什么都行
No! Call off the missiles. I'll do anything.

856
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:12,510
太晚了  晚了整整十五年
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

857
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,320
在你西南偏南方向20英里的是友机
Friendlies two-zero miles south-southwest of your position.

858
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,920
高度10  航向正东  取消攻击
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage.

859
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,630
小薇!  在飞机周围造一个力场出来
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

860
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,430
你说过我们不能用超能力
You said not to use our powers.

861
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:24,830
我知道我说过  照我现在说的做!
I know what I said. Listen to what I'm saying now!

862
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,340
取消攻击  重复  取消攻击!
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

863
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,550
-妈妈?  -薇奥莱特
-Mom? -Violet!

864
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,650
呼救  IG99被友方锁定  取消!
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked. Abort!

865
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,250
飞机上有小孩
There are children aboard.

866
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:43,360
-飞机上有小孩  -不!
-There are children aboard! -No!

867
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,360
-快给我们造个力场!  -我从来没做过这么大的
-Put a field around us now! -I've never done one that big.

868
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,660
快做!
Do it now!

869
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,370
取消  取消  取消!
Abort, abort, abort!

870
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:54,370
取消  取消  取消!
Abort, abort, abort!

871
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,520
振作点!
Brace yourselves!

872
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,430
-妈妈!  -大家都冷静点
-Mom! -Everybody calm down.

873
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,540
我要告诉你们不该怎样
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

874
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,340
我们不该慌张  我们不该...  当心!
We're not gonna panic, we're not... Look out!

875
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,260
-哦  天哪!  这是谁的主意啊?  -我们该怎么办?
-Oh, my God! Who's idea was this? -What are we gonna do?

876
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,460
我们死定了!  我们死定了!
We're dead! We're dead!

877
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,270
-飞机爆炸了!  -我们捡了一条命  可还是死定了!
-It blew up! -We survived but we're dead!

878
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,670
够了!
Stop it!

879
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:04,670
我们不会死的!
We are not gonna die!

880
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,470
你们两个都给我精神点
Both of you will get a grip.

881
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,080
否则就关你们一个月!
Or so help me I will ground you for a month!

882
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,080
明白吗?
Understand?

883
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,490
已经确认命中  目标被摧毁
We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed.

884
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,490
啊  你会挺过来的
Ah, you'll get over it.

885
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:21,600
我好像记得你是喜欢"单干"的
I seem to recall you prefer to "work alone".

886
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:33,610
快放了我!
Release me. Now!

887
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:36,820
-不然怎样?  -我就捏碎她
-Or what? -I'll crush her.

888
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,620
你这话听起来可有点邪恶  好  你就捏吧
That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead.

889
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,630
这很容易的  就像折断牙签一样
It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick.

890
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,630
那就让我看看
Show me.

891
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:59,150
我就知道你做不到
I knew you couldn't do it.

892
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:02,450
即使你已经没什么可失去了
Even when you have nothing to lose.

893
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,160
你很弱
You're weak.

894
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,560
我对你已经没兴趣了
And I've outgrown you.

895
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:20,380
那是近程导弹  陆基的
Those were short-range missiles. Land-based.

896
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,980
往那个方向去希望最大
That way is our best bet.

897
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,990
你要去想杀我们的人呆的地方?
You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us?

898
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,190
-假如那里是陆地  那你说得对  -你希望我们游过去?
-If it means land, yes. -Do you expect us to swim there?

899
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,700
我希望你们相信我
I expect you to trust me.

900
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,480
真是个好兵
What a trooper.

901
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,790
你太让我自豪了
I'm so proud of you.

902
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,090
谢谢  妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

903
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,600
我想你们的爸爸是遇到麻烦了
I think your father is in trouble.

904
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,510
你大概没注意到  我  们现在也好不到哪儿去
If you haven't noticed, we're not doing so hot either.

905
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,810
我要去找他
I'm going to look for him.

906
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:55,710
也就是说在我回来以前  这里就交给你了  薇奥莱特
And that means you're in charge until I get back, Violet.

907
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:58,220
-什么?  -你听见她说了
-What? -You heard her.

908
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,020
把这戴上  你们的身份是你  们最重要的东西
Put these on. Your identity is your most valuable possession.

909
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,130
要保护好
Protect it.

910
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,930
要是出了什么事  就用你们的超能力吧
And if anything goes wrong, use your powers.

911
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:10,930
-可你说过永远不要用...  -我知道我说过!
-But you said never to use... -I know what I said!

912
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,550
你们还记得星期六上午节目里的那些坏蛋吗?
Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

913
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:22,050
这些家伙可跟他们不一样
Well, these guys are not like those guys.

914
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,650
他们不会因为你们是小孩就手下留情
They won't exercise restraint because you're children.

915
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,960
他们一有机会就会杀了你们
They will kill you if they get the chance.

916
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,160
不要给他们机会
Do not give them that chance.

917
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,470
-妈妈?  -小薇  我就全靠你了
-Mom? -Vi, I'm counting on you.

918
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,470
-有些...  -我就全靠你了  坚强点
-There's... -I'm counting on you. Be strong.

919
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,880
达什  要是出了什么事  我要你能跑多快就跑多快
Dash, if anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can.

920
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,480
-能跑多快就跑多快?  -能跑多快就跑多快
-As fast as I can? -As fast as you can.

921
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,190
躲在这里  互相保护  天亮前我会回来的
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I'll be back by morning.

922
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:54,090
妈妈!
Mom!

923
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,700
妈妈  飞机上的事  我很抱歉
Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry.

924
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,100
我想帮忙的  可你要我帮的时候...  我很抱歉
I wanted to help. When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

925
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,010
这不是你的错
Shh. It isn't your fault.

926
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:06,910
我一下子对你要求这么高也不公平
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you.

927
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,520
可现在情况不同了
But things are different now.

928
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,620
你要是再缺少信心  后果我们大家都经受不起
And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

929
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:15,330
你的力量要比你意识到的更大
You have more power than you realize.

930
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,730
不要多想  也不要担心
Don't think. And don't worry.

931
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:20,430
到时候你会知道怎么做的
If the time comes, you'll know what to do.

932
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:23,140
这是你天生的
It's in your blood.

933
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,590
他不是软弱  你知道的
He's not weak, you know.

934
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:03,690
什么? 
 What?

935
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:06,100
珍视生命不是弱点
Valuing life is not weakness.

936
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,800
嘿  假如你说的是牢房里的事
Hey. Look, if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit,

937
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,900
那时一切都在我掌握之中
I had everything under control.

938
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,710
漠视生命也不是力量
And disregarding it is not strength.

939
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:17,510
他虚张声势  我就拆穿了他  亲爱的  就是这样
I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all.

940
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:20,120
我知道他不会真那么...
I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually...

941
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,320
下次你要是想赌博的话  拿你自己的命去赌吧!
Next time you gamble, bet your own life!

942
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,720
火箭?
A rocket?

943
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:34,690
不是说这不好玩  不过我还是想到别处看看
Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around.

944
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:38,690
你以为这里是什么地方?  你以为我们在度假?
What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation?

945
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,600

975
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:06,090
你怎么可能把我放下来?  你还能从我这里夺走什么?

要是你担心有危险  干吗还带他们出来?
If you suspected danger, why'd you bring them?

989
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,860
他们是偷偷跟来的  你也没资格这样说话
They stowed away. You're not striking the proper tone.

990
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:10,180
-你觉得他们是超人?  -达什  记住妈妈说的话
-Think they're supers? -Dash, remember what Mom said.

我还活着

997
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:07,430
我早该告诉你我被解雇了  我承认
I should've told you I was fired, I admit it.

998
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,230
可我不想让你担心
But I didn't want you to worry.

999
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,630
你不想让我担心?
You didn't want me to worry?

1000
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:13,630
可我们现在却在荒无人烟  的树林里奔命
We're running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle.

1001
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:17,140
你老是想和我吵  可我只是很高兴你还活着
You keep trying to pick a fight, but I'm just happy you're alive.

1002
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:22,050
我知道你在那里  隐身小姐
I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear.

1003
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,570
你躲不过我的
You can't hide from me.

1004
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:45,180
-你在那里  -嘿!
-There you are. -Hey!

1005
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,890
不许碰我姐姐!
Don't touch my sister!

1006
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,100
-你怎么做到的?  -我不知道
-How are you doing that? -I don't know!

1007
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,000
不管怎样  千万别停啊!
Whatever you do, don't stop!

1008
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:21,230
妈妈!  爸爸!
Mom! Dad! Hey!

1009
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,230
孩子们
Kids.

1010
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:26,140
-你们都没事  -你们都没事
-You're all right. -You're all right.

1011
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:29,240
-我们担心死了  -我以为再也见不到你们了
-We were so worried. -I thought I'd never see you again.

1012
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:49,170
我爱你
I love you.

1013
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:06,390
时间到!
Time out!

1014
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:11,400
这算什么?  一样的制服?
What have we here? Matching uniforms?

1015
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:16,910
哦  不!  弹力女侠?
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

1016
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:20,910
你娶了弹力女侠?  哇!
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!

1017
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:23,720
还干得很卖力!
And got busy!

1018
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,520
这是超人一家啊
It's a whole family of supers.

1019
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,820
看来我是中大奖了!
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

1020
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,330
哦  这真是太好了!
Oh, this is just too good!

1021
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:34,930
-这艘船的设计很独特...  -事故中无人死亡...
-The ship's unique design... -There were no fatalities...

1022
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:40,040
哈?  哈?  哦  快点!  你得承认这很酷
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool.

1023
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,340
就像电影一样!  机器人会戏剧性地出现
Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically,

1024
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:46,250
造成一些破坏  到处是尖叫的人群!
do some damage. Throngs of screaming people!

1025
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:51,250
就在一切希望都落空的时候  万恶霸王会拯救世界!
And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day!

1026
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,760
我会成为比从前的你还伟大的英雄!
I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!

1027
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,760
你是说你杀光真的英雄  好让自己假冒英雄?
You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one?

1028
01:29:57,770 --> 01:30:01,370
我是真的  真到足可以打败你!
Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you!

1029
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,880
而且我不是依靠你那种罕见的  天赋  
And I did it without your precious gifts, 

1030
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:05,180
你那种特殊的超能力
your oh-so-special powers.

1031
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,580
我会让他们看到英雄的壮举
I'll give them heroics.

1032
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:09,880
我会让他们看到有史以来  最震撼人心的英雄壮举!
I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen!

1033
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,290
然后等我老了  也玩够了  我就会卖掉我的发明
And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions

1034
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:17,890
这样所有人都能成为超级英雄  所有人都能当超人
so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super.

1035
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:21,000
要是所有人都是超人...
And when everyone's super...

1036
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,200
...那也就没有超人了
...no one will be.

1037
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,740
自由射击!
Fire at will!

1038
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:02,760
它打得坦克毫无还手之力
It's overwhelming the tanks.

1039
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,460
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1040
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:08,560
这是我的错  我是一个糟糕的父亲
This is my fault. I've been a lousy father.

1041
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:12,270
对自己拥有的东西视而不见  因为自己被低估而耿耿于怀
Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued

1042
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,470
-却低估了你们所有人  -爸爸?
-that I undervalued all of you. -Dad?

1043
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,680
嘘  别打岔
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1044
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,680
我太沉缅于过去...
So caught up in the past that I...

1045
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,890
你们是我最重要的冒险  可我却差一点忘记你们
You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it.

1046
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:28,090
我发誓  我要把大家安全地带出去  假如我...
I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if I...

1047
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:32,000
我看爸爸今天进步非常大
Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today

1048
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
不过现在我们该下来了
but I think it's time we wind down now.

1049
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,310
我们得回大陆去
We need to get back to the mainland.

1050
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:42,210
我在来的路上看见过一个飞机库  笔直走就到
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead.

1051
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:53,630
卫兵都去哪儿了?
Where are all the guards?

1052
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:55,430
上  上!
Go, go!

1053
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,440
他们每跑一次  你就开一瓶酒
Hey, every time they run, you take a shot.

1054
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,070
就是这个机库  可我没看见飞机
This is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets.

1055
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:24,170
-飞机不够快  -什么东西比飞机还快?
-A jet's not fast enough. -What's faster than a jet?

1056
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:26,470
坐火箭怎样?
How about a rocket?

1057
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:33,280
-好主意!  我可不会开火箭  -没必要
-Great! I can't fly a rocket. -You don't have to.

1058
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,290
用他们上次发射时的坐标就行
Use the coordinates from the last launch.

1059
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:41,600
等一下  我敢肯定万恶霸王  现在已经改过密码了
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now.

1060
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,600
-该怎么登录电脑呢?  -来求我吧?
-How do I get into the computer? -Say please.

1061
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,220
-汉妮?  -怎么?
-Honey? -What?

1062
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:04,230
-我的超人服在哪?  -什么?
-Where is my supersuit? -What?

1063
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:07,830
我的超人服在哪?
Where is my supersuit?

1064
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,940
-我把它放到别处了  -在哪?
-I put it away. -Where?

1065
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:13,340
你为什么想知道?
Why do you need to know?

1066
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,540
我要用它!
I need it!

1067
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:17,650
你别想溜出去逞英雄
Don't you think about running off doing no derrin'-do.

1068
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:20,250
为这次宴会我们都筹划两个月了!
We've been planning this dinner for two months!

1069
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,150
-现在公众有危险!  -我的晚会才有危险!
-The public is in danger! -My evening's in danger!

1070
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:26,760
告诉我衣服在哪儿  你这娘们!  我是在跟你谈大事!
Tell me where my suit is, woman! We are talking about the greater good.

1071
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,960
"大事"?  我是你老婆!
"Greater good"? I am your wife!

1072
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,270
你的头等大事就是我!
I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get!

1073
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:37,170
快跑!
Run!

1074
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,280
我的宝宝!
My baby!

1075
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,790
-超级英雄回来了!  -那是钢火侠吗?
-The supers have returned! -Is that Fironic?

1076
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:50,490
-钢火侠?  -不对  钢火侠的衣服不是这样的
-Fironic? -No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1077
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:55,500
不是  不是  我是新的超级英雄!  我是万恶霸王!
No, no, I'm a new superhero! I'm Syndrome!

1078
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,910
好了  退后吧
All right, stand back.

1079
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:08,920
有人要教这个铁球懂点礼貌
Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners.

1080
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,720
哈哈!
Ha, ha!

1081
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,570
-我们还没到吗?  -该到的时候总会到的
-Are we there yet? -We get there when we get there.

1082
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:46,570
你怎么样  亲爱的?
How you doing, honey?

1083
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:49,670
我非得回答吗?
Do I have to answer?

1084
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:54,980
孩子们  照我说的系好安全带
Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you.

1085
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,990
我们要去了  亲爱的
Here we go, honey.

1086
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,800

1088
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,810
落地会很重
This is gonna be rough.

1089
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:20,320
机器人在金融区  走那个出口?
Robot's in the financial district. Which exit?

1090
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,720
-特拉克生大道  -那样就到市中心了
-Traction Avenue. -That'll take me downtown.

1091
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,320
-我走第七大道吧  怎样?  -别走第七大道!
-I take Seventh, don't I? -Don't take Seventh!

1092
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:28,030
-很好  已经开过头了  -你问我怎么走  我已经告诉你了
-Great, we missed it. -Ask how to get there, I told you.

1093
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,930
-特拉克生大道  -那就去市中心了
-Traction. -That'll take me downtown.

1094
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,730
进右车道!  亮灯!
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1095
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:34,240
-不能走特拉克生大道!  -你要开过头了!
-Not Traction! -You're gonna miss it!

1096
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:03,380
后面的人都好吗?
Is everybody okay back there?

1097
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:07,280
-好极了  爸爸!  -咱们再来一次吧
-Super-duper, Dad! -Let's do that again.

1098
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:13,090
在这里等着  藏好了  我这就去
Wait here and stay hidden. I'm going in.

1099
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:16,400
什么?  让我在边上当看客?
While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1100
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,200
-我不同意  -我要你和孩子们一起等着我
-I don't think so. -I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1101
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,700
我告诉你  想都别想  你是我丈夫
And I'm telling you not a chance. You're my husband.

1102
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,610
是好是坏我都和你在一起
I'm with you for better or worse.

1103
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,710
我非得一个人干不可
I have to do this alone.

1104
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:27,610
-你把这当什么?  做游戏吗?  -不是
-What is this to you? Playtime? -No.

1105
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:29,720
-为了让你再成为神奇超人?  -不是!
-So you can be Mr. Incredible again? -No!

1106
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,420
-那是为什么?  -我不...
-Then what? -I'm not...

1107
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:33,220
-不什么?  -我不够强
-Not what? -I'm not strong enough.

1108
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,220
-这样你就能更强?  -对  不是的!
-This will make you stronger? -Yes. No!

1109
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,430
那这算什么?  是你的锻炼方式?
That's what this is? Some sort of workout?

1110
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:40,230
我不能再失去你了!
I can't lose you again!

1111
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,840
不能  不能有第二次
I can't. Not again.

1112
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,540
我... 不够强
I'm not... strong enough.

1113
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:57,660
要是我们合作  你就不用有多强
If we work together, you won't have to be.

1114
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:59,560
我不知道会发生什么事
I don't know what'll happen.

1115
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,660
我们是超级英雄啊  还能发生什么事?
We're superheroes. What can happen?

1116
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,570
小薇!  达什!  不!
Vi! Dash! No!

1117
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,690
薇奥莱特!
Violet?

1118
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:25,590
-爸爸!  -快走!
-Dad! -Go, go!

1119
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:38,710
-我没事  妈妈  真的  -呆在这儿  好吗?
-I'm okay, Mom. Really. -Stay here, okay?

1120
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,630
寒冰侠来也!
Frozone!

1121
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:54,930
好啊!
Yeah!

1122
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,240
鲍勃!
Bob!

1123
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,970
万恶霸王的遥控器!
Syndrome's remote!

1124
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,980
那个遥控器能控制机器人!
The remote controls the robot!

1125
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:33,290
-扔过来!  扔过来!  -跑吧!
-Throw it, throw it! -Go long!

1126

接住了!
Got it!

1127
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:52,520
亲爱的  打掉他的枪!
Honey, take out its guns!

1128
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,430
接住你了!
Gotcha!

1129
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,700
妈妈  我拿到了!  我拿到遥控器了!
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1130
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,800
遥控器!  控制什么的?
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1131
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:57,210
机器人?
The robot?

1132
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,920
-它又来了!
It's coming back!

1133
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:12,030
-那样不对  -给我!
-That wasn't right. -Give me that!

1134
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:16,330
我们阻止不了它  唯一硬到  可以打穿它的东西是...
We can't stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate it is...

1135
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:20,840
...它自己
...itself.

1136
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,440
它越走越近了!
It's getting closer!

1137
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,850
-没有用啊!  -孩子们!
-It doesn't work! -Kids!

1138
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:27,850
它没起什么作用
It's not doing anything.

1139
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:30,450
-给我们争取点时间  -试试旁边那个按钮
-Try to buy us some time. -Try the one next to it.

1140
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,460
亲爱的!
Honey!

1141
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,080
等一下  再按一下那个按钮!
Wait a minute. Press that button again!

1144
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:55,590
-快离开这里!  -我们哪儿也不去

等目标再近点!  你只有一发炮弹!
A closer target! You got one shot!

1148
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,610
全都趴下!
Everybody duck!

1149
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,740
嘿  冰老弟
Hey, Zone.

你看见了吗?  就是要这样
Did you see that? That's the way to do it.

1152
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:48,560
-那是老套路了.  -对  没什么套路比得上老套路
-That's old school. -Yeah. No school like the old school.

-就像当年一样  啊!  -就像当年一样
-Just like old times. Oh! -Just like old times.

1154

对  那时候也是这么疼
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1155
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,280
我们已经冻结了万恶霸王的全部财产
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1156
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,990
哪怕他打一个喷嚏  我们也会  带着手帕和手铐找到他
If he even sneezes, we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1157
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:08,390
这个国家的人民都很感激你们
The people of this country are indebted to you.

1158
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:10,290
这是不是说我们  可以不用躲躲藏藏了?
Does this mean we can come out of hiding?

1159
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,300
让政客们去考虑吧
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1160
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:15,900
他们要我向你们保证  我们会把其他事都安排好的
I've been asked to assure you we'll take care of everything else.

不如你在水上跑的时候酷
Not as cool as you running on water.

那时候你用手臂钩住那个坏蛋
That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm

1170
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:41,840
又把他甩到另一个家伙身上  真是痛快!
and whiplashed him into the other guy. Sweet!

1171
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,740
-我在听电话呢  -是我
-I'm trying to listen to messages. -It's me.

Jack-Jack is fine, but weird things are happening.

1173

当然杰杰还是很好  可我  真是见了鬼了!
Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm getting really weirded out!

1174
