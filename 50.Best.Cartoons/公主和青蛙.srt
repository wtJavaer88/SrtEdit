万事万物  皆有可能
And anything can happen.

5
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:19,463
就在那一刻  丑陋的小青蛙
Just in that moment, the ugly little frog

6
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:23,077
抬起那双忧郁且圆圆的眼睛恳求道
Looked up with his sad round eyes and pleaded,

7

求您了  亲爱的公主

8
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:29,664
只有您的吻能够破除
Only a kiss from you can break this terrible spell

9
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:33,182
邪恶的女巫施在我身上的诅咒
that was inflicted on me by a wicked witch."

下面是我最喜欢的部分

美丽的公主被他悲惨的遭遇打动了
And the beautiful princess was so moved

12
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,163
她俯下身
by him desperately that she stooped down,

13
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:49,286
捡起这个滑溜溜的生物  身子前倾
picked up the slippery creature, leaned forward,

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,140
把小青蛙捧到她的唇边并吻了他
raised him to her lips and kissed that little frog.

15
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:01,912
之后  青蛙变成了英俊的王子
Then, the frog was transformed into a handsome prince.

16
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,053
他们结了婚  从此幸福的生活在了一起

再读一遍  再读一遍

00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:23,536
 永远不会  亲一只青蛙
I would ever ever ever, I mean never, kiss a frog.

23
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:24,414

35
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,433
我愿意亲一百只青蛙
to meet a prince and to be a princess.

36
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:49,709
女孩们  别再折磨这只可怜的小猫了
You girls, stop tormenting that poor little kitty.

37

比福德  你的鸡蛋要糊了

忘掉开饭馆吧

00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,884
必须先抓住他的胃

好了  快点  开门吧

快来瞧  妈妈
Look at it, mama.

230
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:50,438
有没有种想哭的感觉
Doesn't it just make you wanna cry?

231
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,527
是啊
Yes.

232
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:55,521
你站的地方的右边会有个收银台

还有  天花板上
And, and here from the ceiling,

235
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,895
会有一盏大大的水晶吊灯
a big all crystal chandelier here.

236
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:04,926
真不愧是你爸爸的女儿
You're your daddy's daughter, alright.

237
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:08,499
他以前也总是不停地唠叨这些
Used to go on and on about this old sugar mill too.

238

亲爱的

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,361
我相信这地方会焕然一新的
I'm sure this place is gonna be just wonderful.

240
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,673
但糟糕的是你会很辛苦

241
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,332
但我怎能在马上成功时半途而废呢
But how can I let up now when I am so close.

242
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,062
我得确保爸爸的艰辛
I've gotta make sure all daddy's

243

得到应有的回报
hard work means something.

蒂亚纳  或许你爸爸没能得到
Tiana, your daddy may not have gotten the place

245
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:26,449
你梦想中的房子  但他拥有比这更好的

从此之后与他快乐的共舞

妈妈  我没有时间跳舞
Mama, I don't have time for dances.

251
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,257
这件事只能先等等
That's just gonna have to wait a while.

252
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,640
到底要等多久
How long are we talking about here?

253
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,320
光阴似水  弥足珍贵
Ain't got time for messing around.

254
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,683
虚度光阴  非我本性
And it's not my style.

255
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:53,249
我要抱外孙
I want some grandkids.

256
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,825
慵懒之城  催人倦怠
This whole town can slow you down.

257
00:13:56,826 --> 00:14:00,876
驱使众人  择易而行
People taking the easy way.

258
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,646
我心所欲  了然于心
But I know exactly where I'm going to get.

259
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:07,063
日有所新  日渐接近
And getting closer, closer, everyday.

260
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:12,804
成功之日  已不远矣
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there.

261
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:19,102
众人笑我疯狂  但是我心依旧
People down here think I'm crazy but I don't care.

262
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:25,153
陷阱磨难  我皆不惧
Traps and tribulations have had my share.

263
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:28,196
如今势不可挡
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now

264
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,787
而我势在必得
cause I'm almost there.

265
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:41,796
爸爸曾说  童话亦可成真
I remember Daddy told me: "Fairytales can come true."

266
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,549
实现与否  全权在你
You gotta make 'em happen, it all depends on you."

267
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,210
谨遵此言  勤奋不懈
So I work real hard each and every day.

268
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:54,648
果不其然  事随我愿
Now, things, for sure are going my way.

269
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,421
如愿以偿
Just doing what I do.

270
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,302
瞧瞧吧  伙计们  成功之日  已不远矣
Look out boys, I'm coming through.

271
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:03,112
成功之日  已不远矣
And I'm almost there.

陷阱磨难
There has been traps and tribulations.

00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,821
我皆不惧
You know I have had my share.

00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:35,930
爬过高山
But I've climbed the mountain.

279
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,561
趟过河流
I've crossed the river.

280
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,914
成功之日  已不远矣
And I'm almost there.

281
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:42,927
成功之日  已不远矣
I'm almost there.

282
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:56,135
成功之日  已不远矣
I'm almost there!

283
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,551
借过
Excuse me.

284
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:06,903
需要帮忙吗  老兄
You need a hand there, buddy?

285
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,718

少爷  我在到处找你
Sir, I've been looking for you everywhere.

288
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,120
真巧  劳伦斯
Oh, what a coincidence, Lawrence.

289
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,098
我在到处躲你
I've been avoiding you everywhere.

290
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,703
化装舞会要迟到了
We're going to be late for the masquerade.

291
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,386
听着  劳伦斯  听着
Listen, Lawrence. Listen.

292
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:40,933

00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,771
原本这里很无聊
It was boring here.

294
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,836
但你们的出现增添了美感
It's beautiful, you know.

295
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:47,491
不行
No hope.

296
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:50,831
和我跳舞吧  胖墩先生
Oh, dance with me, fat man.

297
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,279
放松点  老兄
Stay loose, bro.

298
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,084
你现在该在舞会上
You should be in the ball right now.

300
00:16:56,197 --> 00:17:00,055
但首先  我想请这里所有人喝一杯
But first, I'll buy everyone here a drink.

301
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,799
拿什么请
With what?

302
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,865
说到这  你有两个选择
At this point, you have two choices.

303
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,082

好吧
Alright.

306
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:15,988
好吧
Fine.

307
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,145
但首先  我们要跳舞
But first, we dance!

308
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:20,796
因为有人看不到自己的双脚
For someone who cannot see his feet.

309
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,432
得了吧  骗人的

00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:11,105
我很快就回来  甜心
I'll be right back, sugar.

465
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:13,168
我有件非常适合你的衣服
I've got just the dress for you.

466
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:18,258
小蒂  亲爱的  你看到他和我跳舞了吗
Oh, Tia, honey. Did you see the way he danced with me?

467
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,485
他很快就会向我求婚的
A marriage proposal can't be far behind.

468
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,905
谢谢你  晚星
Thank you, Evening Star!

469
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,300
大人们总是说
You know, I was taught to think

470
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:32,050
只有小孩和疯子才会对星星许愿
that wishing on a star was just for babies and crazy people.

471
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:36,000
天哪  看看你自己
Look at you!

472
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:40,682
你就像五月的木兰花一样美丽
Oh, aren't you just as pretty as a Magnolia on May?

473
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:44,833
我们小时候许下梦幻般的愿望
Seems like only yesterday we were both little girls

474
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,383
就像昨天的事一样
dreaming our fairytale dreams.

475
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,347
而今天  这些愿望终于实现了
And tonight they're finally coming true.

476
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:54,217
好了  继续努力吧
Well, back into the fray.

477
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:58,892
祝我好运吧  纳温王子
Wish me luck. Oh Prince Naveen!

478
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:13,335
只差一点
Almost...

479
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,747
只差一点就成功
Almost there.

480
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:23,762
人们从四面八方而来
People would have come from everywhere.

481
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:29,169
差一点就成功了
I was almost there...

482
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:45,412
真不敢相信我也会这样做
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

483
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:51,299
求你了  求你了  求你了
Please, please, please.

484
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,323
真搞笑
Oh, very funny.

485
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,122
怎么样
So, what now?

486
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:07,334
我猜你想要一个吻吗
I reckon you want a kiss?

487
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,880
一个吻听起来不错  来吧
Kissing would be nice, yes?

488
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,753
抱歉  抱歉  抱歉
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

489
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,458
我  我不想吓你的
I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you.

490
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:18,497
我  别  别  别
I... No, no, no, no...

491
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,986
等等  住手
Wait. Hold on.

492
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:22,706
公主  你的双臂很有力嘛
You have a very strong arm, princess.

493
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:23,980
好啦  请住手
Okay, please.

494
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:25,980
把玩具猴放下
Put the monkey down.

495
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,199
退后  不然我就  我就
Stay back or I'll... I'll...

496
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,531
等等  等等
Please, please, please, please...

497
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,112
请允许我介绍一下自己
Well, allow me to introduce myself.

498
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:36,749
我是纳温王子
I am Prince Naveen...

499
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:40,059
从马耳其顿来
... of Maldonia.

500
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:41,149
王子
Prince?

501
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,542
但我并没许愿要
But I didn't wish for any...

502
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:47,489
等等  如果  如果你是王子
Hold on, if... if... if you're the prince,

503
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,529
那  和洛特跳舞的
then... then who was that waltzing with Lotte

504
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,876
又是谁
on the dance floor?

505
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:56,227
我只知道  前一分钟我还是个
All I know is one minute I am a prince,

506
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:58,394
英俊迷人  万众瞩目的王子
charming and handsome,cutting-a-rug.

507
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:02,528
等我醒来我就变成了这个样子
And the next thing I know, I'm tripping over these.

508
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:04,220
等等  等等
Wait... wait... wait...

509
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:07,257
等一下  我知道这个故事
Wait, I know this story.

510
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:08,949
青蛙王子
The Froggie Printo!

511
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,555
-你是说青蛙王子吗  -是的
- The Frog Prince?  - Yes.

512
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,243
以前我妈妈每晚
Yes, my mother had the servants

513
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:16,314
都让仆人念给我听
read this to me every night.

514
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,562
对了  对了
Yes, yes, yes!

515
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,208
这就是破解之法
This is exactly the answer.

516
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,577
你必须要吻我
You must kiss me.

517
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:24,765
你说什么
Excuse me?

518
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,746
我保证  你会享受这感觉的
You will enjoy it, I guarantee.

519
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:30,079
所有女人都会沉醉在纳温王子的香吻中
All women enjoy the kiss of Prince Naveen.

520
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,160
来吧  撅起嘴
Come, we pucker.

521
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:35,910
我还没适应
That's new.

522
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:37,837
我很抱歉
Look. I'm sorry.

523
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:39,585
我很想帮你
I'd really like to help you.

524
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:43,726
但我不会亲吻一只青蛙的
But I just do not kiss frogs!

525
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:47,179
但刚才在阳台上  是你问的我
But on the balcony, you asked me.

526
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,940
我没想到你会回答
I didn't expect you to answer!

527
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,487
但你必须吻我
Oh, but you must kiss me.

528
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:53,403
我不止英俊非凡
Look, besides being unbelievable handsome,

529
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:56,776
我的家庭也非常富有
I also happen to come from a fabulously wealthy family.

530
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,293
自然  我能给你某种报酬
Surely I can offer you some type of reward

531
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:02,084
或是满足你一个愿望
or a wish I could grant, perhaps?

532
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,311
可以吗
Yes?

533
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:07,808
只需要一个吻吗
Just one kiss?

534
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:08,775
只一个吻
Just one.

535
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:11,870
除非你想吻久一点
Unless you beg for more.

536
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:25,767
好了  蒂亚纳 你能做到的
Okay, Tiana. You can do this.

537
00:29:25,768 --> 00:29:26,832
你能做到的
You can do this.

538
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:29,632
集中精神  看着嘴  好的
Look. Just look here. Okay.

539
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,813
我的天啊
[speaks Maldonian]

540
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,377
你没什么变化嘛
Well, you don't look that much different.

541
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:50,638
但你怎么跑到上面去了
But how did you get way up there?

542
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:53,064
我又怎么跑到下面来了  在这堆
And how did I get way down here, in all these...

543
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:56,924
别紧张  公主
Easy, Princess.

544
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:57,789
公主  别慌张
Princess, do not panic!

545
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,176
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

546
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:02,189
我变绿了  还  满身黏液
I'm green and... and I'm... I'm slimy!

547
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,464
不  不是黏液
No... That's not slime.

548
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:06,650
-什么  -是保护黏胶
- What?  - You're security mucus.

549
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,746
斯特拉
Hey Stella!

550
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,607
抓住那青蛙
Get that frog!

551
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:35,218
快跑
Run!

552
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,178
我跑不了
I can't run.

553
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,573
我是只青蛙
I'm a frog!

554
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,518
那就跳
Then hop!

555
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,431
跳
Hop?

556
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:41,458
快跑
Run boy!

557
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,011
跑啊
Run!

558
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:43,136
恶狗
Monster dog!

559
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,433
我来
I got this!

560
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:48,743
-小心 -小心
- Look out!  - Look out!

561
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:49,270
别挡道
Out of the way!

562
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:49,889
我们这是去哪儿
Where are we going?

563
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,789
借光
Excuse me.

564
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,104
我什么都看不到
I can't see a thing.

565
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:53,447
我也是
Neither can I...

566
00:30:59,042 --> 00:30:59,919
站住  斯特拉
Wait, Stella.

567
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,723
要飞了
Going up.

568
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:01,420
斯特拉  别追
Stella, wait!

569
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:02,180
是我啊  蒂亚纳
It's me, Tiana.

570
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:03,175
蒂亚纳
Tiana?

571
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,570
斯特拉和我说话了
Stella was talking to me.

572
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:08,259
那只狗
The dog.

573
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,188
他刚才和我说话了
He just talked to me.

574
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,670
如果你一直
You know, if you're going to

575
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:12,151
被小事困扰的话
let every little thing bother you,

576
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:14,964
那今晚对你来说会相当漫长
it's going to be a very long night!

577
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:25,598
天啊
Oh dear.

578
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:27,787
你走路真轻
Oh... you're so quiet.

579
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:29,266
你把他放走了
You let him go?

580
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:31,117
瓶子太恶心了
The bottle was so disgusting.

581
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:32,952
所以我没把盖拧紧
So I've loosened the lid.

582
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:35,448
所以
And this is like... ouch!

583
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,405
我怎么会和巫术
How did I ever get tangled up in

584
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:41,890
扯上关系
all these voodoo madness?

585
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:44,416
我不干了
I can't get through with this.

586
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:52,114
你去带着这恶心的东西吧
You wear this, this disgusting thing!

587
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:53,535
你小心点!
Careful with that!

588
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:56,116
要是这个摔坏了  我就
Anything happens to this, I'm gonna be...

589
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:01,622
拉瑞  巫术的真谛在于
The funny fact about voodoo, Larry.

590
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:05,271
你不能控制自己的罪孽
Can't control a sin for myself.

591
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:07,618
况且  你我都知道
Besides, you and I both know

592
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,632
掌控天下靠的不是魔力
the real power in this world ain't magic.

593
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:12,492
而是金钱
It's money.

594
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:14,344
放手一搏吧
Buck yourself in.

595
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:16,237
那倒是
That's true.

596
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,609
你难道不厌倦卑微的生活吗
Aren't you tired of living on the margins?

597
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,745
那些富人坐在奢华的车里
While all those fat cats in their fancy cars

598
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,704
根本不用正眼瞧你
don't give you so much on the sideways glance.

599
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:26,323
是的  我厌倦了
Yes, I am.

600
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:29,589
你要做的就是把富老爹的小公主娶到手
All you gotta do is marry Big Daddy's little princess.

601
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,234
你将会得到他的
He will be splitting that juicy La Bouff fortune

602
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:33,746
一半财产
right down the middle.

603
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:35,350
说好的  六四分成
60, 40, like I said.

604
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:36,905
好啊
Yeah.

605
00:32:37,515 --> 00:32:40,139
那纳温王子呢
But, what about Naveen?

606
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,164
那小东西很可能被轧死在路边
Your little slip-up would be a minor bumping the road.

607
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:47,696
只要保管好王子的血就行了
So long we've got the prince's blood in this.

608
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,255
好的
Yes.

609
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,799
巫术
Voodoo?

610
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:57,315
你是说这里所发生的一切
You mean to tell me these all happened

611
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,048
是因为你惹了一个影子巫师吗
cause you were messing with the Shadow Man?

612
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,261
他非常有说服力
He was very charismatic.

613
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,753
向星星许愿比这个好多了
It serves me right for wishing on stars.

614
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:05,734
实现愿望的唯一途径
The only way to get what you want in this world

615
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,055
就是努力工作
is through hard work.

616
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:08,173
努力工作
Hard work?

617
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:11,278
为什么  公主为什么要努力工作
Why... why would a princess need to work hard?

618
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,600
什么  我不是公主
Huh? Oh. I'm not a princess.

619
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:14,780
我是服务生
I'm a waitress.

620
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:16,295
服务生
A waitress?

621
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,552
难怪那个吻不起作用
Well, no wonder the kiss didn't work.

622
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:19,531
你对我撒谎
You lied to me.

623
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:21,710
我没有  我从没说过自己是公主
No, I... I never said I was a princess.

624
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:24,071
你也没说过自己是个服务生
You never said that you were a waitress!

625
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:25,752
你  你戴着皇冠
You, you... you were wearing a crown!

626
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,689
这是化装舞会  你这个被宠坏的富少爷
It was a costume party, you spoiled little rich boy!

627
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,788
好吧 你真是个蠢蛋
Oh, oh yes. Well, the egg is on your face, alright.

628
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:35,185
我才不是什么富少爷
Because I do not have any riches!

629
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:38,107
-什么 -我其实是个穷光蛋
- What?  - I am completely broke.

630
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:59,010
可你之前说你非常富有
You said you were fabulously wealthy!

631
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:01,679
不  是我的父母非常富有
No. My parents are fabulously wealthy.

632
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,276
但他们不给我钱  因为我是个
But they cut me off for being a...

633
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:04,489
水蛭  是水蛭
Leech! Leech!

634
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,728
你是个穷光蛋
You're broke?

635
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:08,321
那你还好意思说我是骗子
And you have the gall to call me a liar?

636
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:12,423
我没说谎
It was not a lie.

637
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:13,598
我正准备
I fully inte...

638
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,420
我正准备变得有钱
I fully intent to be rich again.

639
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,076
一旦我娶了夏洛特・拉布福小姐
Once I marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff

640
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:21,897
她会帮我的
and she will help me.

641
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:22,755
你是个王子吗
You're a prince?

642
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:23,495
当然是
Obviously.

643
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,605
她会帮你的
She'll help you!

644
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,954
好吧  你们两个结婚后
Alright then, when you two are married,

645
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,418
你要信守诺言
you are gonna keep your promise

646
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,064
帮我开餐馆  对吗
and get me my restaurant, right?

647
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:37,831
别心急
Not so fast.

648
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:40,099
我是对美丽的公主作出承诺
I make that promise to a beautiful princess,

649
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,063
可不是对你这个疯女人
not a cranky woman.

650
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,723
那些浮木为什么会动
Why are those logs moving?

651
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:47,253
那些不是浮木
Those aren't logs.

652
00:34:50,246 --> 00:34:53,049
大木头上有牙齿哦
I've got bits on the big wood.

653
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:04,661
等等  他们要去哪儿
Wait... where, where did they go?

654
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:06,050
过来
Come here!

655
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:07,551
我咬到他们了
One taste of the muscle.

656
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:09,853
啊  那是我的尾巴
Ouch! That's my tail!

657
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,355
他们会找到这里吗
Know where they'll find?

658
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,688
你自求多福吧
Find you own dream

659
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,511
他在哪儿
There he is.

660
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:18,385
就是他  就是他
That's him! That's him!

661
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:20,505
帮我度过这关
Help me out of this one,

662
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:23,153
我和夏洛特结婚后就给你买餐馆
once I marry Charlotte, I should get your restaurant.

663
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,310
你一定很美味  比苍蝇好吃
You gonna taste so good. Tasted better than fly.

664
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,893
快点  快拉我一把
Quick, quick. Pull me up!

665
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,900
你虽然能跳  但你躲不了
You can hop, but you can't hide.

666
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,158
我们有一整晚的时间
We've got all night.

667
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:35,057
好了  服务员
Alright, waitress.

668
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:37,136
看来我们要在这里待一阵子了
Looks like we are going to be here for a while.

669
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:40,960
所以我们或许应该销魂一下
So we may as well get comfortable.

670
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,680
你这浑身黏液的东西  离我远点
Get your slimy self away from me.

671
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:46,094
我说过  这不是黏液
I told you, it is not slime!

672
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:48,017
是保护黏胶
It is mucus!

673
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:59,698
太阳晒屁股了  睡美人
Rise and shine, sleeping beauty.

674
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,247
鳄鱼都走了
Gators are gone.

675
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,558
我们要回到新奥尔良
We gotta get back to New Orleans

676
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,077
把你惹的这些麻烦都解决掉
and undo this mess you've got us into.

677
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:08,448
我只是一个爱胡说八道的
That was just the one parading around

678
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:09,742
花花公子而已
with the fully baloney, Tiana.

679
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,138
划船回家的音乐
Music to paddle back.

680
00:36:13,558 --> 00:36:15,242
你还是来帮帮忙吧
I could use a little help.

681
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:16,445
帮忙
Help?

682
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:18,151
那我弹大点声吧
I will play a little louder.

683
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:23,943
如果你不要弹琴然后来
How about a little less picking and...

684
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,870
我知道这曲子
I know that tune!

685
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:30,897
点燃我的布鲁斯
"Jipper my blues"

686
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:36,643
继续  老兄
Play it, brother.

687
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:40,983
太棒了
Oh yeah!

688
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,074
我终于等到知音了
I've waited you for all my life.

689
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:50,048
你从哪里学会演奏这个的
How did you learn to play like that?

690
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:50,601
在长沼
Well, in the Bayou,

691
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,370
那里是世上最好的爵士乐学校
it's the best jazz school in the world.

692
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:54,145
所有伟大的音乐家都在船上演奏
All the greats play the river boats.

693
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,160
若能和那些人同台演出
Oh, Louis will give anything

694
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:59,227
让路易斯干什么都行
to be up there jamming with the big boys.

695
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:00,076
那你为什么不去呢
So, why don't you?

696
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:01,607
我去过一次
Oh, I tried once.

697
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:14,297
结果不太理想
It didn't end well.

698
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,512
见到你真的非常高兴
It has been a real pleasure meeting you.

699
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:20,344
路易斯  谢谢你没吃了我们
Louis, and thank your kindness for not eating us.

700
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:21,941
但我们最好还是上路吧
But we'd best to be on our way.

701
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:24,035
你们要去哪里
Where... where are you going?

702
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,179
找人解除魔咒
To find somebody to break this spell.

703
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,131
什么魔咒
What spell?

704
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:29,943
听好  我的朋友
Brace yourself, my scaly friend.

705
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,014
我们不是青蛙
We are not frogs.

706
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:33,928
我们是人类
We are humans.

707
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:39,212
你没开玩笑吗
You are serious?

708
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,889
我是马耳其顿的纳温王子
I am Naveen, Prince of Maldonia.

709
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,621
她是服务生蒂亚纳
And she is Tiana, the waitress.

710
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,435
别亲她
Do not kiss her.

711
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,537
让我来说吧
Now, just a second.

712
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:50,398
这个年轻人被巫术
This groom here got himself turned

713
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,531
变成了青蛙
into a frog by a voodoo man.

714
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:52,735
-如今 -巫术
- And now... - Voodoo?

715
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,901
就是欧迪婆婆用的法术吗
Like the kind Mama Odie do?

716
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:56,188
欧迪婆婆
Mama Odie?

717
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:59,676
欧迪婆婆   她是长沼的巫术女王
Mama Odie. She's the voodoo queen of the bayou.

718
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:04,113
她会魔法  咒语以及各种巫术
She got magic and spells, all kind of voodoo.

719
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,803
你能带我们去找她吗
Could you take us to her?

720
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:08,968
到长沼深处的黑暗森林中去吗
To the deepest, darkest part of the bayou?

721
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:11,045
被飞刀利器追杀
Facing razors, sharp backup machines

722
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:13,849
或被猎枪杀死吗
that trap us and hunt us with guns?!

723
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,304
不可能
No.

724
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,012
学着点
Watch and learn.

725
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,447
路易斯
Louis.

726
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,202
我们不能帮你实现愿望真是太遗憾了
It's too bad we cannot help you with your dream.

727
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:29,612
如果你个头小一点  牙再少一点
If only you were smaller, less toothy.

728
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:31,827
给观众演奏时就
You could play jazz to the darling crowds

729
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,756
不会吓到他们了
without scaring them.

730
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:36,091
无所谓了  享受孤独吧  朋友
Anyway, enjoy your loneliness, my friend.

731
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,120
祝你幸福
Apprécier

732
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:39,327
不错
Cute.

733
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:40,683
但是不会
But it's not gonna...

734
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:44,082
各位  我有个疯狂的主意
Hey guys, I... I just have a crazy idea.

735
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,833
让欧迪婆婆把我变成人类怎么样
What if I asked Mama Odie to turn me human?

736
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:49,114
路易斯  你是个天才
Louis, you are a genius.

737
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:51,477
哈利路亚
Halleluiah!

738
00:38:55,986 --> 00:39:00,294
如果变成人类  我就直奔新奥尔良
If I were human being, I'd head straight for New Orleans.

739
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:02,776
用心吹响这只小号
And I'd blow this horn, so hot and strong.

740
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,615
没人像我一样卖力
Like no one they'd ever seen.

741
00:39:04,616 --> 00:39:09,597
我是路易斯・阿姆斯特朗  悉尼・巴特先生
Well, here is Louis Armstrong, Mister Sdyney Bechet.

742
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,722
听过我的美妙演奏
All the boys gonna step aside.

743
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:13,843
所有人都会臣服一旁
When they hear this song this alligator play.

744
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:14,846
听啊
Listen!

745
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,362
如我所愿  变成人类
When I'm human, as I hope to be.

746
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:29,769
牛儿回家前  我会一直吹
I'm gonna blow this horn till the cows come home.

747
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,481
人人都向我鞠躬致敬
And everyone's gonna bow down to me.

748
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:35,332
谢谢  谢谢  谢谢
Thank you! Thank you! Oh, thank you!

749
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,820
宝贝  我也爱你
I love you too, baby!

750
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:43,219
当我变回自己  我要随心所欲
When I'm myself again, I want just the life I had.

751
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,473
这个主意不错
That doesn't sound too bad.

752
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:49,726
红发女郎  黑肤美女
A red head on my left arm.

753
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:52,079
左拥右抱
A brunette on my right

754
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,296
一两个金发美女手持蜡烛
A blonde or two to hold the candles.

755
00:39:54,297 --> 00:39:55,805
就应该这样
And that seems just about right.

756
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:56,654
路易斯
Eh, Louis?

757
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,441
人生苦短
Life is short.

758
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:58,736
岁月穿梭
When you're done, you're done.

759
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:00,884
人生在世  理应享受
We're on this Earth to have some fun.

760
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:02,334
事事如此
And that's the way things are.

761
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:03,187
跟我说说  兄弟
Tell me, brother!

762
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:07,370
当我变回人类  我肯定会变回去
When I'm human, and I'm gonna be.

763
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,045
还要像以前一样风流倜傥
I'm gonna tear it up like I did before.

764
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:12,070
这才是皇室的待遇
That's a royal guarantee.

765
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:14,506
你要结婚了
You are getting married.

766
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:15,542
好吧
Oh... right.

767
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:18,656
不能再招蜂引蝶了
I just have to leave a string of butterfly behind me.

768
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,968
你会变得谦虚
Your modesty becomes you.

769
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,216
充满责任感
And your sense of responsibility.

770
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,489
我通过努力得来一切
I worked hard for everything I got.

771
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,828
事情本该如此
And that's the way it supposed to be.

772
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:32,182
当我变回人类  至少我会那样
When I'm a human being, at least I'll act like one.

773
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:34,668
若每日尽力做到最好
If you do your best each and every day,

774
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,809
好事就会顺心如意

00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:52,754
全程为你们带路
Taking you all...you know.

934
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:55,340
快点
Come on, yo!

935
00:47:55,494 --> 00:47:57,097
跟上队伍
Keep that line going.

936
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:58,810
保持队形
And the line's going.

937
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,055
没错  你的队形
Yeah, your line...

938
00:48:02,974 --> 00:48:08,126
朋友  我知道已经让你们帮了很多忙
Friends, I know I'm in hug to you all pretty deep already.

939
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:12,968
不过看起来我们的小青蛙王子迷路了
But it seems our little froggy prince lost his way.

940
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,835
我需要你们帮我把它找回来
And I need your generous assistance to get him back.

941
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:18,899
我懂你们的意思
I hear you.

942
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,569
对你们有什么好处对吧
Now, what's in it for you 'all?

943
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:25,235
只要我搞定了拉布福老爹
Well, as soon as I dispose "Big Daddy" La Bouff,

944
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,322
我就能统治这个小镇
then I'm gonna run this town.

945
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:33,171
可以将整个新奥尔良城
I'll have the entire city of New Orleans

946
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,813
握在手中
in the palm of my hand.

947
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:37,986
你们就可以获得他们所有的灵魂
And you'll have all the wayward souls,

948
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:40,754
来满足你们内心那些阴暗的欲望
your dark little heart's desire.

949
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,752
你们一定会喜欢的  不是么
You all love that, don't you?

950
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,112
所以  就这么说定了吧
So, we got ourselves a deal?

951
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:05,708
现在听我说
Now we're talking!

952
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,333
我们要去把那只青蛙找回来
We're gonna find ourselves a frog.

953
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:09,868
搜遍每一个角落
Search everywhere!

954
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:11,643
不管长沼还是驻地
The bayou, the quarter.

955
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,455
把他活捉回来
Bring him to me alive.

956
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,294
他必须活着才行
I need his heart pumping.

957
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:17,133
现在出发吧
For now.

958
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:18,345
找到他
Find it!

959
00:49:18,364 --> 00:49:19,428
仔细找
Third squiz.

960
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,901
我们要回去了
I'm taking them back to way.

961
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:39,699
很高兴认识你们
Nice meeting you.

962
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,668
再见了小家伙
Bye bye, Puggy.

963
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:41,912
再见  路易斯
Bye bye, Louis.

964
00:49:42,795 --> 00:49:45,121
还有别忘了让伊万杰琳在那儿等我
And don't forget to tell Evangeline wait right there.

965
00:49:45,122 --> 00:49:46,371
再见
Bonjour!

966
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:47,410
你女朋友吗
That's your girl?

967
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:50,649
我女朋友  不是不是
Oh, no... my girl?

968
00:49:50,975 --> 00:49:53,054
她是伊万杰琳
That's Evangeline.

969
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:54,392
伊万杰琳?
Evangeline?

970
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:58,166
她是世界上最美的萤火虫
She's the most prettiest firefly ever did glow.

971
00:49:59,252 --> 00:50:02,659
我每天晚上都和她聊天
You know I talk to Evangeline almost every night.

972
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,402
她喜欢聆听  不爱说话
She got sound, don't say much.

973
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,433
我很确定
And I know in my heart.

974
00:50:07,452 --> 00:50:11,071
总有一天  我们会在一起的
Someday, we're gonna be together, yeah.

975
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:13,710
真甜蜜
Oh, that's so sweet.

976
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:14,832
没错  很甜蜜
Yes, so sweet.

977
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:18,192
别这么快就下结论  伙计
Just do not settle down so quickly, my friend.

978
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:21,052
沼泽地里的萤火虫还有很多呢
There are plenty of fireflies in the swamp.

979
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:23,166
怎么了
What?

980
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:26,994
我被灌木丛里的刺扎到了
Prick of bush has just got me!

981
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,110
我不行了
Get it down!

982
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,008
不行啦
Get it down!

983
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:33,228
黑暗正侵蚀着我
The darkness, it's closing in!

984
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:34,506
好冷啊
I'm so cold!

985
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:36,644
你能别动吗  大块头
Will you hold still, you big baby?

986
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,430
我只是碰了碰而已
I touched it yet.

987
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,612
快看那两只欢蹦乱跳的
Oh, take a look at them, the two jumpers.

988
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:51,913
我感觉已经尝到他们大腿的味道了
I can taste their frog legs already.

989
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:54,293
拿他们蘸着贝卡酱吃
Like them taste real good with the sauce bercha',

990
00:50:54,294 --> 00:50:55,591
对吧  爸爸
right pa?

991
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,400
你小声点儿
You keep quiet!

992
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:06,382
和我想的完全一样
My thoughts exactly do things.

993
00:51:06,947 --> 00:51:09,220
我们该去抓点青蛙了
It's time to catch us some frogs.

994
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:18,059
知道吗服务生
You know, waitress,

995
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,016
我终于知道你有什么问题了
I have finally figured out what is wrong with you.

996
00:51:21,017 --> 00:51:22,102
是吗
Have you now?

997
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:25,385
你根本不知道如何寻欢作乐
You do not know how to have fun.

998
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,311
对吧  必须得有人告诉你这些
There. Somebody had to say it.

999
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:31,238
谢谢  正好我也找到你的问题所在
Thank you, 'cause I figured out what your problem is too.

1000
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:33,434
我  过于优秀了  对吧
I am... too wonderful?

1001
00:51:34,418 --> 00:51:38,358
错  你是个没钱没品又懒惰的呆子
No, you're a no-count, plundering, lazy bump on a log.

1002
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,657
真无趣
Kill joy.

1003
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:41,475
你说什么
What'd you say?

1004
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,434
没什么
Ah, nothing.

1005
00:51:43,688 --> 00:51:45,114
卑微的严肃小姐
Miss stick in the mud.

1006
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:46,390
听着先生
Listen here, mister.

1007
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,331
当你在你的象牙宫殿里
Miss stick in the mud has had to work

1008
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:49,302
用着银勺子
two jobs her whole life

1009
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:51,522
被无数侍女簇拥着的时候
while you've been sucking on a silver spoon

1010
00:51:51,523 --> 00:51:54,730
卑微的严肃小姐不得不靠加班养家
chasing chamber maids around your...your ivory tower!

1011
00:51:55,298 --> 00:51:57,175
事实上它是抛光的大理石
Actually, it's polished marble.

1012
00:51:57,241 --> 00:52:00,566
我抓到了一只  伙计们
Wow, I got me one, boys!

1013
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:02,781
去把那只小的也抓走
Go get the little one over there!

1014
00:52:17,528 --> 00:52:18,978
他们有枪
They're with guns!

1015
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:23,217
看啊  达尼尔
Look at him, big Darnell.

1016
00:52:23,218 --> 00:52:24,850
我会好好地为你准备晚餐的
I will make a gold ready with your dinner...

1017
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,239
不不不
No, no, no...

1018
00:52:26,337 --> 00:52:29,973
小虫子就要做小虫子该做的事
A bug got to do what a bug got to do.

1019
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:42,178
我最后的一颗牙也要掉了
I think I've done with my favourite tooth.

1020
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:48,975
达尼尔  我来帮你了
Darnell I'm gonna help you.

1021
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,552
老爸  我抓到了一只
Oh hoo. Pa, I got one!

1022
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:57,566
你给我老实点
You quiet down!

1023
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:59,232
你的那只怎么了
What happened to yours?

1024
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:01,861
你给我闭嘴
Shut your crap, will you?

1025
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,246
自由啦
Free!

1026
00:53:16,783 --> 00:53:20,835
老爸  你听到那个诡异的声音了吗
Pa, did you hear that suspicious sound?

1027
00:53:20,952 --> 00:53:22,480
是啊
Yeah.

1028
00:53:22,555 --> 00:53:25,309
我当然听到了
I sure did.

1029
00:53:30,762 --> 00:53:32,487
你们两个在看什么
What'd you two looking at?

1030
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,483
就差一点
Just missed it.

1031
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:39,746
我会打到他的
I will take him down.

1032
00:53:39,747 --> 00:53:40,670
我的天哪
Thank god

1033
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:41,946
我来
I got this.

1034
00:53:41,947 --> 00:53:43,065
趁现在  快跑
Now go!

1035
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,744
你在做什么
What did you...

1036
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,658
别别别
No, no, no...

1037
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,076
不要啊
Don't do it!

1038
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:54,021
看这个
Watch this.

1039
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:57,394
又没打到
Missed.

1040
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,251
真没见过你们俩这样的青蛙
You two ain't like no frogs I ever seen.

1041
00:54:19,713 --> 00:54:21,054
他们还真聪明
They're smart.

1042
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:22,667
我们还会说话呢
And we talk, too.

1043
00:54:34,252 --> 00:54:35,772
你没事吧  小虫子
You're alright there, little bug?

1044
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,336
我没事
I'm fine.

1045
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:40,367
你的口臭差点杀了我
But your breath nearly kill me to death.

1046
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,322
你能不能帮忙
Would you mind?

1047
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,744
我帮你搞定  兄弟
I got you covered, bro.

1048
00:54:46,732 --> 00:54:48,873
好多了啊  小东西
Much applies peewee.

1049
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:52,250
屁股下面这些呢
Now, how about the lower side?

1050
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:56,395
我们还会说话  我喜欢这句
And we talk too, I like it!

1051
00:54:56,517 --> 00:54:57,861
你其实还蛮幽默的嘛
You're secretly funny.

1052
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:59,472
不是个卑微的严肃小姐了吗
Not a stick in the mud?

1053
00:54:59,473 --> 00:55:01,193
-那个  我的意思是  -快说  快说
- Well, I was going...  - Say it, say it.

1054
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,419
好吧  其实你不是
Alright, you're not exactly...

1055
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,102
我听不见
I can't hear you.

1056
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:04,790
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry. What?

1057
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:07,016
并非一个非常严肃的小姐
... a complete stick deep in the mud.

1058
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,496
轻点  轻点
Easy, easy.

1059
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:11,960
这个卡得很深  等等
This one in there. Hold on.

1060
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:12,981
我的天
Holy...

1061
00:55:13,636 --> 00:55:17,755
我知道我们想快点到欧迪婆婆那里
I know we gotta get to Mama Odie like a little speed.

1062
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,715
但是这个意外
but this particular extra occasion

1063
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:21,826
还需要一点时间
gonna take a while, yeah.

1064
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:23,921
可怜的路易斯
Oh, poor Louis.

1065
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:25,897
你知道怎样能让我感觉好点么
You know what would make me feel better.

1066
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:29,803
小龙虾沾着蛋黄酱
Crawfish smutted in Remoulade Sauce.

1067
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:30,509
发发慈悲吧
Mercy!

1068
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,328
还有几个
Gotta a little more

1069
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:34,143
或者鳕鱼也可以
Some of the flosser sprinkle with prawn.

1070
00:55:34,144 --> 00:55:35,611
妈妈咪呀
Oh, Mama!

1071
00:55:35,771 --> 00:55:37,356
沼泽秋葵汤如何
How about some swamp Gumbo?

1072
00:55:37,357 --> 00:55:38,459
那也不错
That'll do.

1073
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,724
听起来不错
Sound delicious.

1074
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:42,496
我想喝点开胃酒
I'll start a pre-dinner cocktail

1075
00:55:42,497 --> 00:55:44,015
和一盘开胃菜
and something to nibble on.

1076
00:55:44,016 --> 00:55:45,495
不过我还是等等吧  谢谢
But I'll wait. Thanks.

1077
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:47,321
不不不
No, no, no...

1078
00:55:47,393 --> 00:55:48,458
至高无上的殿下
Your royal highness,

1079
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:50,857
你要负责切这些蘑菇
you are going to mince these mushrooms.

1080
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:51,667
做  做什么
Do... do what?

1081
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:54,073
切蘑菇
Mince the mushrooms!

1082
00:55:54,307 --> 00:55:55,574
快动手
Hop to it!

1083
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:57,755
这太可笑了
This is ridiculous.

1084
00:55:57,756 --> 00:55:59,491
-你开始切了吗  -好吧
- Are you mincing?  - Alright!

1085
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:00,896
放轻松
Relax.

1086
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:13,461
还好嘛
What.

1087
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,767
让我来  殿下
Step aside, mister.

1088
00:56:15,979 --> 00:56:18,763
学着点
Watch and learn.

住在城堡里  所有事都是准备好的
When you live in a castle, everything is done for you.

我承认在这之前我感觉挺好的
I admit it was a charm life and

直到父母剥夺了我的继承权

我突然发现  我什么都不会做

你的蘑菇还是切的不错的  殿下

拜托  这算什么  你伤了一只青蛙的心
Oh, come on. What was that? That was below the frog frail.

他们说  你好
They said Hello?

1107
00:57:33,914 --> 00:57:34,825

然后你说  把你的丑鱼带进来
And you said get your ugly fish in.

1109

我也想见见她

Where's she at?

00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,346
你一定不能错过她
Oh, you can't miss her.

爱让梦想成真  没错

我从没跳过舞

1137
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:01,891
我爱你  伊万杰琳

看着她在天空中闪耀
Look out she lights on the sky.

我们只是跳了支舞而已

我这个197岁的盲老太太身手不错吧
Not bad for a 197-year-old blind lady.

真高兴能找到你  欧迪婆婆

你一定不知道我们都经历了些什么

很高兴再次见到你  雷

在邻居问题上还有点小问题
Got into a trouble for flying into the neighbour again.

1165
01:01:30,715 --> 01:01:32,839
我喜欢那女人

1166
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,531
欧迪婆婆

我们也不想浪费您太多的时间

1175
01:01:52,214 --> 01:01:54,388
我只是在和你们开玩笑而已
I'm just messing with you all.

1176
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:57,153
你怎么知道我们想变回
How on earth did you know that we wanted to turn back...

1177
01:02:01,726 --> 01:02:02,486
欧迪婆婆
Mama Odie?

1178
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:03,502
小家伙
Juju!

1179
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,875
你怎么不告诉我我的汤好了
Why didn't you tell me that my Gumbo is burning?

你确定这就是那个住在长沼树洞里的
You're sure that this is the right bright voodoo lady

1181
01:02:08,651 --> 01:02:10,684
那个聪明婆婆

1182
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,853
非常肯定
Pretty sure.

1183
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,343
真不敢相信
Can't believe this.

1184
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:16,197
看来又得重做了
Got to do it back around here.

1185
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:17,133
欧迪妈妈  如果你
Mama Odie, if you...

01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:18,356
尝一下
Taste this!

1187
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:21,476
怎么样
Well?

1188
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:23,484
再加一勺迪巴斯卡酱
Heat it hotter with a cup of shot of

1189
01:02:23,485 --> 01:02:24,852
和蜂蜜然后加热
Debasaki and the bee's sneeze.

1190
01:02:24,853 --> 01:02:25,719
我们能不能
Now, can we...

1191
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,745
小家伙
Juju!

1192
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,297
美味极了
Yeah! That's got some zaim to it!

1193
01:02:35,826 --> 01:02:37,260
这就是我想要的
That's just what it needed.

1194
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:41,503
你们现在明白自己想要什么了吗
Now, you all figure out what you need?

1195
01:02:41,914 --> 01:02:43,476
就像你说的那样  欧迪婆婆
It's just like what you said, Mama Odie.

1196
01:02:43,477 --> 01:02:45,051
我们想变回人类
We need to be human.

1197
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:48,330
啊  你们只需说出你们要的东西
Ah! You only got to say you all need.

1198
01:02:48,608 --> 01:02:50,748
你们只想着怎么变回人类
You want to be human.

1199
01:02:50,952 --> 01:02:53,829
但你们却不知道你们需要的是什么
But you're blind to what you need.

1200
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,843
我们想要什么  我们需要什么
What we want, what we needed.

1201
01:02:55,844 --> 01:02:57,392
都一样嘛  对吧
It's all the same thing, yes.

1202
01:02:57,667 --> 01:03:00,109
一样吗  才怪
It's the same thing? No!

1203
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:03,474
听我说
You listen to your mama now.

1204
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,700
你们的长相并不重要
Don't matter what you look like.

1205
01:03:07,129 --> 01:03:08,918
穿着也不重要
Don't matter what you wear.

1206
01:03:09,314 --> 01:03:11,768
手上戴几个戒指
How many ring you got on your finger.

1207
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:13,077
我们不在乎 没错
We don't care. No,

1208
01:03:13,078 --> 01:03:14,360
我们不在乎
we don't care!

1209
01:03:14,526 --> 01:03:16,456
你们从哪来并不重要
Don't matter where you come from.

1210
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:18,753
你们是什么也不重要
Don't even matter what you are.

1211
01:03:18,976 --> 01:03:21,293
是狗  是猪  是奶牛  是羊
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat.

1212
01:03:21,294 --> 01:03:23,730
我们什么都不缺
Had 'em all in here (we had 'em all in here)

1213
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:26,123
他们都知道他们要什么
And they all knew what they wanted.

1214
01:03:26,163 --> 01:03:28,304
想让我做什么
What they wanted me to do.

1215
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,912
我告诉他们究竟需要什么
I told them what they needed.

1216
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,427
就像我会告诉你们一样
Just like I be telling you.

1217
01:03:33,428 --> 01:03:36,242
你们得再好好想想
You got to dig a little deeper.

1218
01:03:36,243 --> 01:03:38,119
探究自我
Find out who you are.

1219
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:41,128
你们得再好好想想
You got to dig a little deeper.

1220
01:03:41,302 --> 01:03:43,203
其实并不难
It really ain't that far

1221
01:03:43,512 --> 01:03:45,842
了解了自己就能
When you find out who you are,

1222
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:48,173
了解自己的需求
you'll find out what you need.

1223
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:52,124
蓝天和阳光能证明这些
Blue skies and sunshine guaranteed.

1224
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:54,548
你们得再好好想想
You got to dig (dig).

1225
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:57,128
你们得再好好想想
You got to dig (dig).

1226
01:03:58,562 --> 01:04:00,645
青蛙王子是个富裕的孩子
Prince froggy is a rich little boy.

1227
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:02,921
你想再次变得富裕
You wanna be rich again.

1228
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,488
但这样不会让你变得开心
That ain't gonna make you happy now,

1229
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:07,523
以后会让你开心吗
did it make you happy then?

1230
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:08,384
不会
No!

1231
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:10,506
金钱会让你迷失自我
Money ain't got no soul.

1232
01:04:10,507 --> 01:04:12,860
金钱让你迷失心灵
Money ain't got no heart.

1233
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:15,225
你要学会自我控制
All you need is some self-control.

1234
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,537
给自己一个全新的开始
Make yourself a brand new start.

1235
01:04:17,538 --> 01:04:20,214
你们得再好好想想
You got to dig a little deeper.

1236
01:04:20,215 --> 01:04:22,235
马上就要想到了
Don't have far to go.

1237
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:25,139
你们得再好好想想
You got to dig a little deeper.

1238
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,856
告诉大家婆婆这样告诉你
Tell the people, mama told you so.

1239
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:29,886
不知道你会如何理解
Can't tell you what you'll find

1240
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:32,609
也许爱情能让你发现自我
Maybe love will grant you piece of mind.

1241
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,783
再想想你就会发现
Dig a little deeper and you'll know

1242

青蛙小姐

1254
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:06,929
想的还是不够深
You ain't dug near far enough.

1255
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,167
深入地想想自己
Dig down deep inside yourself.

1256

1263
01:05:30,888 --> 01:05:34,986
能证明这些

1266
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,530
我知道了  欧迪婆婆
Yes, I do, Mama Odie!

1267
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:50,249
我还要投入更多的努力
I need to dig a little deeper

1268
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,374
然后努力工作想办法开自己的餐厅
and work even harder to get my restaurant.

1269
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,580
不是吧
No.

1270

1272
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:00,900
穿什么也
It don't...

1273
01:06:00,901 --> 01:06:04,301
没人愿意和雷一起唱  好吧
Nobody gonna sing with Ray... okay.

1274
01:06:04,597 --> 01:06:08,601
如果你们还想变回人类
Well, if you still long to be human,

1275
01:06:08,602 --> 01:06:10,604
只有一个方法
there's only one way.

1276
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:15,674
秋葵汤秋葵  快快显灵
Gumbo, Gumbo, lead the path.

1277
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:17,929
我们需要你的意见
We need a precious.

1278
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,554
你发现什么了
What you got?

1279
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,065
洛特吗
Lotte?

1280
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:25,464
不过她也不是个公主啊
But she's not a princess.

1281
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:27,180
闭嘴  看着秋葵汤
Oh, shut up and look at the Gumbo.

1282
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,406
对了
That's right.

1283
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:33,606
她父亲拿着皇冠进来了
Big Daddy's came with the mind cooperate.

1284
01:06:33,786 --> 01:06:38,135
所以洛特就是个公主了
So that makes Lotte a princess.

1285
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,218
这样也算
Does that count?

1286
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:40,548
当然算
Yeah, it does.

1287
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:42,647
但只能持续到午夜而已
But only till midnight.

1288
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,502
到了黎明就失效了
Win more than an aurora.

1289
01:06:44,503 --> 01:06:45,547
我的天哪
[speaks Maldonia]

1290
01:06:45,548 --> 01:06:46,595
快点行动吧
Hop along.

1291
01:06:46,596 --> 01:06:50,344
你必须在午夜前找到她并让她吻你
You only got till then to get the Princess to kiss you.

1292
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,404
一旦她吻了你  啪
Once she does... boom!

1293
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:56,616
你们就会变回人类了
You'll boom to a human.

1294
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:57,358
午夜
Midnight?

1295
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,856
那我们快没时间了
Oh, that doesn't give us much time at all!

1296
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:00,236
那我呢  婆婆
What about me, mama?

1297
01:07:00,237 --> 01:07:01,330
我也想变成人类

这样我就能和大师们一起玩爵士了

我想要手指脚趾还有肚子
I want fingers, and toes, and a belly button...

1300
01:07:05,431 --> 01:07:07,415
不是这种凸出来的  而是那种凹进去的
not the kinds that sticks out; but that kinds that goes in.

1301
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:10,108
你也得再好好想想
You dig a little deeper.

1302
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,078
以后就你就会发现你的需求了
You'll find every time you need.

1303
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,605
好了好了好了
Come on, come on, come on!

别像女人那么婆婆妈妈的
You like a woman in here.

我  我马上就来
I'll... I'll catch up with you later.

01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:29,790
伊万杰琳  我是否可以看着蒂亚纳的眼睛
Evangeline, can I just look Tiana in the eyes

1319
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:30,837
然后说

我愿意牺牲一切

因为  因为我爱你

01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:40,476
天哪  你居然敢向我的女人表白

我没有爱上伊万杰琳

我爱的是蒂亚纳

1328
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,740

两份也行  不然三份

1335
01:08:59,905 --> 01:09:01,826
我等不及要告诉蒂亚纳了
I can't wait to tell Tiana!

1336
01:09:01,827 --> 01:09:05,045
不不不  我想亲自告诉她  一个人

你对我的影响很大
You've had quite an influence on me.

我和很多女人交往过
Which is amazing because I have dated

算了  听我说
And anyway, listen.

01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:05,158
其实你  你是个爷们

不不不  你当然不是男人
No no no! You are not a guy!

1361
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,147
我还是从头说过吧
Let me begin again!

1362
01:10:09,548 --> 01:10:11,854
我今晚不在状态
I am not myself tonight.

1363
01:10:11,897 --> 01:10:12,646
蒂亚纳
Tiana!

1364

没错  爵士乐
Yes! Jazz!

1372
01:10:33,378 --> 01:10:34,707
整个餐厅都会响起音乐
Pouring out to every window.

1373
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:35,580
应该更优雅点儿
It should be elegant.

1374
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:37,734
可以优雅一些  但要恰到好处
You gotta keep it loose, thought gotta let it swing.

1375
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:39,270
你很在行嘛  你可以来帮我演奏
You know good, you gotta let it playing.

01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:41,066
你想让我去演奏吗
You'll let me perform?

1378
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:42,354
我去问问店长
I'll talk to the owner.

1379
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:43,804
店长同意了
Owner says yes.

她当然会
She does that!

1381

全世界的人都会赶来
Also gotta become a gather from all walks' life

1382
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:50,597
只为了尝尝我们的美食
just to get a taste of our food.

1383
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,472
我们的美食
Our food?

1384
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:57,191
哦  我不是这个意思  是我父亲
Huh? Oh, no, no. My daddy.

1385
01:10:57,509 --> 01:11:00,024
他一直想开一家自己的餐厅
He always wanted to open his restaurant.

1386
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,330
可惜他去世得早  无法亲眼看到

有了你的帮忙  明天我的梦想就能实现了

01:11:09,574 --> 01:11:12,149
如果我明天一早不能筹到钱的话
If I don't deliver that money first thing tomorrow,

1390
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,850
我的餐厅就没了
I'll lose this place forever.

1391
01:11:17,802 --> 01:11:19,253
蒂亚纳我爱
Tiana, I love...

1392
01:11:23,774 --> 01:11:28,313
我喜欢你说起你梦想时的样子
the way you like that when you talk about your dream.

1393

我  我保证我会不惜一切
I... I promise I will do whatever it takes

1395
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:37,331
帮你实现愿望的
to make it come true.

1396
01:11:42,517 --> 01:11:45,142
我  我去找他们几个
I'll... I'll go roundup the boys.

1397
01:11:59,596 --> 01:12:04,636
伊万杰琳  我一直都很清楚我想要什么
Evangeline, I've always been so sure about what I want

1398
01:12:04,637 --> 01:12:05,689
直到现在
and now I...

1399
01:12:07,579 --> 01:12:08,947
我该怎么办呢
What do I do?

1400
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:11,449
请告诉我吧
Please tell me.

1401
01:12:17,073 --> 01:12:19,088
亲爱的纳温王子
Prince Naveen, darling?

1402
01:12:19,397 --> 01:12:20,842
你得快点啦
You'd better hurry up.

1403
01:12:20,843 --> 01:12:23,767
我们明早的婚礼可不能迟到呀
Don't wanna be late for our morning gown wedding.

1404
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:25,597
我正在穿礼服
I'm getting dressed.

1405
01:12:25,598 --> 01:12:28,294
等一会儿  亲爱的  我马上就好
Just a few moments, it's fine dearest Char.

1406
01:12:28,295 --> 01:12:31,768
好吧甜心  我们在油轮上等你
Okay honey Veen, we will be waiting in the packet.

1407
01:12:31,769 --> 01:12:34,057
老爸  停车
Daddy, stop the car!

1408
01:12:34,254 --> 01:12:36,859
天哪  我被诅咒了
Oh my heavens! I'm doomed!

1409
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,501
不  拉瑞  我才是被诅咒那个
No, Larry! I'm the one who's doomed!

1410
01:12:40,502 --> 01:12:42,377
除非我们把那只青蛙的血
Unless we get that frog's blood in...

1411
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:52,165
我们终于重回正轨啦
We are back in business, boys!

1412
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,028
拿开你的手
Just keep the hands from me!

1413
01:12:55,029 --> 01:12:56,348
劳  劳伦斯吗
Law... Lawrence?

1414
01:12:56,349 --> 01:12:59,696
对啊  抓好他
Oh yeah. Hold still, your heaven.

1415
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:06,816
雷
Ray!

1416
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:08,633
看见纳温了吗
Have you seen Naveen?

1417
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:09,899
看看你
Look at you.

1418
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,474
戒指呢
Where's the ring at?

1419
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:12,932
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1420
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:15,287
老大不说  我也不会
Well, the captain say none,

1421
01:13:15,288 --> 01:13:17,598
因为老雷的嘴巴像鼓一样
I am gonna say none cause old Ray is

1422
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:18,858
被封得严严的
seal up high in the drum

1423
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:19,876
我什么都不会说的
and none out of me, no.

1424
01:13:19,877 --> 01:13:20,460
雷
Ray.

1425
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:22,330
好吧  老大说他不想娶夏洛特而想娶你
Okay, captain say he ain't gonna marry Charlotte but you.

1426
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,108
当你们俩得到那个吻变成人之后
When they two got kiss and you both turn into human.

1427
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:26,371
他会去找工作  你也有了餐厅
He's gonna find a job, you get that restaurant.

1428
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:28,039
我好像说得太多了  是吧
I said too much, didn't I?

1429
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,076
刚刚好  雷
You said just enough, Ray!

1430
01:13:30,283 --> 01:13:32,042
伊万杰琳  谢谢你
Thank you, Evangeline.

1431
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:42,860
他刚刚想要向我求婚
He was trying to propose!

1432
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:44,893
所以才弄得一团糟
That's what all those fuss was about.

1433
01:13:44,894 --> 01:13:48,318
而我一直认为他想和富裕的千金结婚
And here I thought all he wanted was to marry a rich girl.

1434
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,464
我们这是在找什么
What are we looking for, ya?

1435
01:13:51,465 --> 01:13:53,037
你只需要留神点
You just keep your eyes out!

1436
01:13:53,038 --> 01:13:55,227
寻找比我们大好几倍的
For the biggest, gloriest globe with

1437
01:13:55,228 --> 01:13:56,760
光彩亮丽的公主
the multigraph princess

1438
01:13:56,761 --> 01:14:01,132
她会去亲一只青蛙
about to kiss herself a... a frog.

1439
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:02,744
亲爱的朋友
Dearly beloved,

1440
01:14:02,745 --> 01:14:06,963
我们聚到这里参加这次盛会
we all gathered here tonight in this fine celebration

1441
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:11,209
见证王子和这位女士
to join together this prince and this young woman

1442
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:13,568
的完美结合
in holy naturally.

1443
01:14:13,569 --> 01:14:16,642
不  这不可能是真的
Oh no, this can't be real, darling.

1444
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:19,000
为什么你还是青蛙呢
And how you can still be a frog?

1445
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:20,637
欧迪婆婆说
Mama Odie, she said...

1446
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:41,224
我知道你看到了什么  但是
I know what we seen with our eyes, but...

1447
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:44,578
但我们得回去
We just go back there,

1448
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:46,984
去让你的童话变成真的
we're gonna find out your fairytale come true.

1449
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:49,615
不是你想什么  就能得到什么
Just because you wish for something, doesn't make it true.

1450
01:14:49,616 --> 01:14:52,656
就像我的伊万杰琳经常对我说的一样
It's like my Evangeline always says to me...

1451
01:14:52,657 --> 01:14:55,224
雷  伊万杰琳只是一颗星星
Evangeline is nothing but a star, Ray.

1452
01:14:55,253 --> 01:14:59,165
一个巨大的热气团  离这里十万八千里
A big ball of hot air, a million miles from here!

1453
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:03,708
在受伤之前  面对现实吧
Open your eyes now, before you get hurt.

1454
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:14,739
她只是在说气话而已
She's just speaking under a broken heart.

1455
01:15:14,874 --> 01:15:16,367
肯定是这样
That's all it is

1456
01:15:17,397 --> 01:15:18,848
快伊万杰琳
Come on, Evangeline.

1457
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,445
我们来帮她看清真相
We go show her the truth.

1458
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:27,357
如果你们中有谁不同意
If any of you objects to the union of the two.

1459
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,035
要么现在说  要么永远都不说
Speak now or forever hold your keep.

1460
01:15:31,036 --> 01:15:33,200
我  我  我  我反对
Me! Me! Me! I object!

1461
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:37,835
纳温王子  你愿意小夏为你的妻子吗
Do you, Prince Naveen takes Char to be your wife?

1462
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:39,975
哥们儿  你要做的都做完了
Chap! What you do is done.

1463
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:47,012
直到你们走到生命的尽头
... as long as you both shall live.

1464
01:15:47,232 --> 01:15:50,517
什么  我愿意  当然愿意
What? I do. Yes. I'm for it.

1465
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,317
是你吗  老大
Is that you Cap?

1466
01:15:53,318 --> 01:15:55,177
雷  把我弄出来
Ray! Get me out of this box!

1467
01:15:55,178 --> 01:15:56,351
说话小声点
I can hear you.

1468
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:58,402
我马上把你弄出来
I'm gonna get you out of this box.

1469
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:03,299
直到生命的尽头
... as long as you both shall live.

1470
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,681
我愿意
Oh, I do.

1471
01:16:06,134 --> 01:16:09,785
如果这样  在上帝的指引下
And so, by the power given to me.

1472
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:13,507
我现在宣布
I now pronounce you...

1473
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:15,716
拉瑞
Larry!

1474
01:16:18,334 --> 01:16:21,248
上帝啊  你没事儿吧
Oh goodness gracious! Are... you alright?

1475
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:23,904
给我一点时间整理一下
I just need a moment to compose my tone.

1476
01:16:23,905 --> 01:16:25,825
真是个疯子
Shitty crackers!

1477
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:27,915
劳伦斯  你为什么要这样做
Lawrence! Why are you doing this?

1478
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:32,427
这是对你多年羞辱我的报复
It's payback for all those years of humiliation.

1479
01:16:32,428 --> 01:16:35,181
回到你的婚礼现场
Get your royal run back on that wedding cake

1480
01:16:35,182 --> 01:16:36,214
赶快完成它
and finish this deal!

1481
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:38,511
他在做什么
Oh, what's he doing?!

1482
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:39,692
阻止他
Stop him!

1483
01:16:40,535 --> 01:16:41,437
我不行
I can't!

1484
01:16:41,849 --> 01:16:42,745
我抓住了
I got it!

1485
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,203
它也抓住我了
It got me too!

1486
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:45,954
那个护身符
That talisman.

1487
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:47,513
别挡道
Clear aside!

1488
01:16:49,493 --> 01:16:50,678
快  快
Come on come on!

1489
01:16:57,723 --> 01:16:58,777
雷
Ray?

1490
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:02,954
喂  你怎么停下来了
Hey, why'd you stop?

1491
01:17:05,147 --> 01:17:07,616
这是一只真的鳄鱼
It's a real alligator!

1492
01:17:10,991 --> 01:17:11,694
雷
Ray?

1493
01:17:11,695 --> 01:17:14,770
这个证明我们看见的并不是事实
This proof what we saw ain't what we thought we saw!

1494
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:15,536
这是什么
What is this?

1495
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:17,157
这是一种巫术
It's a voodoo...

1496
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:19,419
影子巫师创造了它然后把它
The Shadow Man, he produced it with the...

1497
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,444
无论如何不能让影子巫师再拿到它
You can't let shadow man get this no matter what!

1498
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:25,580
快跑  快跑
Now, run girl. Run!

1499
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,810
别逼我点亮我的屁股
Don't make me light my butt!

1500
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:34,498
我速度很快
I got it a lot of movement!

1501
01:17:34,499 --> 01:17:35,825
过来啊
Come here you!

1502
01:17:36,394 --> 01:17:37,662
下一个是谁
Who's next?

1503
01:17:51,177 --> 01:17:52,473
雷
Ray!

1504
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:57,110
雷
Ray?

1505
01:18:06,705 --> 01:18:07,703
让开
Back off!

1506
01:18:07,789 --> 01:18:10,790
不然我把这个摔成碎片
Or I'm gonna break this thing into a million pieces!

1507
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:32,592
纳温
Naveen?

1508
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:40,822
这比在长沼的沼泽地里
Now ain't this a whole lot better than hopping around

1509
01:18:40,823 --> 01:18:42,421
跳来跳去美好多了吧
the bayou for the rest of your life?

1510
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:44,594
影子巫师
Shadow Man.

1511
01:18:45,902 --> 01:18:47,866
蒂亚纳  你真让我头痛
Got a headache to you, Tiana.

1512
01:18:48,386 --> 01:18:51,198
你为什么不要一个大一点的梦想呢
When you dream, you dream big.

1513
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,254
看看这里
Just look at this place.

1514
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:56,942
金碧辉煌
Would be the crown, jewel of the crystal scene.

1515
01:18:58,232 --> 01:19:01,821
你只要把我的小小法宝交出来
And all you got to do to make this a reality

1516
01:19:01,974 --> 01:19:04,880
这里就全都是你的了
is hand over that little talisman of mine.

1517
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,401
不
No.

1518
01:19:07,508 --> 01:19:09,833
这  这可不行
This... This is not right.

1519
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:11,572
别这样  亲爱的
Come on now, darling.

1520
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:14,712
想想你所付出的一切
Think of everything you've sacrificed.

1521
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:16,267
你要的一切就是
Girl, all you wanna do is...

1522
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:18,458
我说过她不会去的
I told you she wouldn't come.

1523
01:19:18,908 --> 01:19:21,978
想想那些怀疑你能力的人说过的话
Think of all those they say who doubt you.

1524
01:19:21,979 --> 01:19:24,056
你不可能拥有这样一家餐厅
You ain't gotta get enough for the restaurant.

1525
01:19:24,057 --> 01:19:28,964
像你这样背景的女孩  还是放弃吧
Woman of your background, you better off will yet.

1526
01:19:29,618 --> 01:19:31,567
别忘了你可怜的老爸
And don't forget your poor daddy.

1527
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,994
工作多么努力的男人啊
That was one hardworking man.

1528
01:19:37,743 --> 01:19:40,577
有时还要打两三份工
Double, sometimes triple shifts.

1529
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:44,378
更别说他的劳累疲倦
Never let known how bored, tired and beat down

1530
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,021
以及失败感
he really was.

1531
01:19:46,022 --> 01:19:46,968
爸爸
Daddy!

1532
01:19:46,969 --> 01:19:49,054
小宝贝
Hey! Baby case.

1533
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:51,504
真遗憾  所有的辛勤劳累
Shame all that hard work

1534
01:19:51,505 --> 01:19:54,023
换来的只是坏掉了的苹果
didn't about much more than a busted apple,

1535
01:19:54,024 --> 01:19:55,575
一个秋葵汤锅
a gumbo pot

1536
01:19:55,681 --> 01:19:58,691
和一个从未实现的梦想
and a dream that never get off to back porch.

1537
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:00,855
但是你
But you...

1538
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,642
你现在可以让你可怜老爸的梦想成真
you can give your poor daddy everything he ever wanted.

1539
01:20:08,494 --> 01:20:10,487
来吧  蒂亚纳
Come on, Tiana.

1540
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:13,212
你的梦想快实现了
You're almost there.

1541
01:20:17,404 --> 01:20:19,570
我爸爸从来没得到过他想要的
My daddy never did get what he wanted.

1542
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:26,365
但需要的一切他都有了
But he had what he needed.

1543
01:20:26,987 --> 01:20:28,427
他有爱
He had love.

1544
01:20:28,428 --> 01:20:30,707
他知道什么是最重要的
Never lost sight of what was important.

1545
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,068
别激动  小心
Easy with that, be careful!

1546
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:34,190
我不会被你骗倒的
