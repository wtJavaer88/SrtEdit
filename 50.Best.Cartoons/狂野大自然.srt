2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,530
当时我就在那里 面对赛伦盖提
So there I was, face to face with the biggest,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,400
…最大最凶猛的花豹，然后…
meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti. And...

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,530
你大吼一声 吓得他的豹纹掉满地
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,970
爸，这故事我听过N遍了
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,010
你听我说过 有一次我把奸笑土狼
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,070
…弄哭，对吧？  听过了
Cry? Yep.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,010
我被鳄鱼攻击？  爸
The croc attack?  Dad.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,980
好啦，我再想想看
OK. Think.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,210
好吧，尽管想吧
Yeah, you do that.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,310
我想到了，聪明小子
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,190
你一定没听过这个故事
here's one I know you haven't heard.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,720
故事发生在一个小地方 我称它
It all started in the little place I like to call...

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,130
…大草原
...the wild.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,570
【野蛮任务】

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,670
他们是大草原 跑得最快的牛羚
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,970
他们真的超快的
We're talking fast.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,140
其他的狮子早在 几小时前就放弃猎捕他们
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago,

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,980
除了你老爸
except your old man.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,780
还好我知道一条捷径
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,160
我自以为困住他们了 但尘沙散去
I thought I had 'em. Until the dust cleared.

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,090
才发现中了牛羚的圈套
Classic wildebeest trap.

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,090
你怎么办？
So, what did you do next?

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,830
我怎么办？  对啊
What did I do?  Yeah.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,390
我大吼一声
That's when I gave them the roar.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,420
就这样？  好戏在后头
That's it?  Hold on a sec.

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,650
我以为这样就搞定了
I only thought it was over.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,090
不过他们有一项秘密武器
But they had a secret weapon.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,100
我从没见过那么大的牛羚
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,030
足足有四公尺高  才四公尺？
He was 14 feet tall!  Fourteen?

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,600
我是说四百公尺 又三十公分
I meant 1,401 feet tall!

32
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,570
酷毙了
Cool.

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,630
而且他还有两只…不，四只
And he had two... No, four

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,650
最巨大的牛羚角
of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,850
哇塞  他喷出红色的气焰
Whoa!  His breath was red hot!

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,510
我是说绿色的啦
I mean, green.

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,890
而且他超讨厌这鬼地方
And he hated the environment.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,930
我知道要打败他 一定要激发我内心深处
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep,

39
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,980
前所未有的勇气
deeper than I ever had before.

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,000
于是我强忍住恐惧
So I swallowed my fear,

41
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,260
深深地吸了一口气
sucked in the biggest breath I could.

42
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,660
爸，我准备好了
Dad, I'm ready!

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,930
你行吗？  我行！
You got it?  I got it!

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,660
我行！  那就让他好看吧
I got it!  Well, let him have it!

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,360
大声吼吧，儿子
Roar, son!

46
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,620
（纽约市立动物园）

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,730
每次都是这样
Story of my life.

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,360
你的吼声吓跑一群牛羚 我的吼声只会逗小朋友笑
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests. Mine makes the babies laugh.

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,560
别气馁，你这次好多了
Hey, come on. That was much better.

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,900
我是说真的 降了半个八度
I'm serious! It dropped half an octave.

51
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,240
你再降半个八度 我都会被你吓到皮皮挫
It dropped half an octave. And it sure scared me.

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,710
让我全身的毛都竖起来  才怪咧，爸
Made my hair stand up on end.  Yeah, right, Dad.

53
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,220
好吧，再练一次  今天就练到这里
OK. Let's take it from the top.  I'm done for today.

54
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,780
别这样嘛，再来一次 就差这么一点点
Come on, come on, one more. You were so close.

55
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,580
也许是技术性问题
Maybe it's something technical.

56
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,720
也许你的嘴巴张得不够大 要像这样子
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough. Like this.

57
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,460
爸，多谢你的技术指导
Dad, thanks for the technical help,

58
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,860
不过你要我吼得跟你一样 就得带我到真正的大草原
but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.

59
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,730
你有没有搞错？ 咱们在这里应有尽有
Hold on a second. We've got everything we could ever want here.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
生活很享受 每天照三顿吃饭
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.

61
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,170
超无聊的  无聊？
It's boring.  Boring?

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,540
我在这里学不会狮吼  雷恩
I'll never learn how to roar here.  Ryan.

63
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,010
不过你放心 我终于想出办法
But don't worry. I finally figured out

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,310
怎么去野外  真的吗？
how we can get to the wild.  You did?

65
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,080
鸽子说那些绿色箱子 都是运到那里
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.

66
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,920
那些箱子不吉利 离它们远一点
Those boxes are bad news. Stay away.

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,580
可是，爸…  我知道你很郁卒
But, Dad...  I know you're frustrated,

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,350
不过狮子在这里 也能学会大吼
but a lion finds his roar...  Here.

69
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,450
爸，你老是说这种话哄我
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!

70
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,830
有一只老鼠
It's a rat!

71
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,630
快把那只老鼠赶走
Get that rat off my baby!

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,000
老鼠？
A rat?

73
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,790
你好
Hello!

74
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,460
好好玩的老鼠哦
Silly, silly rat.

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,970
老鼠才不喜欢这种手环，小姐 你这小…
Rats do not got bling like this, lady.  You little...!

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,640
那是我见过最丑的小贝比
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,380
斑尼，你偷小贝比的糖果？
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?

78
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,490
别说得这么难听 我只是怕他会蛀牙
Stealing is such a strong word. I prefer "liberating."

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
小鬼，我听到你的吼声 又降了…
Hey, kid, heard the roar. Down another...

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,560
八度  八度！
Octave.  Octave!

81
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,530
你要来替我跟你爸加油 看我们连续第五次夺下
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,940
冰龟赛冠军吗？
turtle-curling title?

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,910
我根本就不会吼叫 你怎么知道我在加油？
I can't even roar. How would you even know I'm there?

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,540
你真的觉得降了八度吗？
So, you really think it dropped an octave?

85
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,840
当然罗
Absolutely.

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,940
八度到底是什么东东？  我听见了
What the heck is an octave?  I heard that.

87
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,880
兔子  胆固醇太高，我吃坚果
Rabbit.  Cholesterol. I'll stick with the nuts.

88
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,990
我不知道他的问题出在哪儿
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.

89
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,160
他都已经11岁了 可是吼声还停在9岁的程度
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.

90
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,390
山大王，帮个忙
Little help here, Sammy?

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,530
你知道吗？ 也许你的标准太高了
You know what? Maybe you're setting the bar too high,

92
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,130
你老是提那些山大王 在大草原的英勇故事
with all those stories about Samson the Wild.

93
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,510
他超爱听那些故事的 对他是一种激励耶
Hey, he's always loved those stories! They inspire him.

94
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,850
好啦，我不想跟你吵 我怕你拿我的尾巴当牙线
OK. I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,250
你的牙缝有渣渣  哪里？
You got something right there.  Where?

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,920
不对，另一边  这边？
No, no, other side.  Here?

97
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,080
抱歉，斑尼  弄出来了
Sorry, Benny.  You got it.

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,690
亲爱的大朋友小朋友
Attention, friends.

99
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,130
别忘了到礼品店购买 全国最抢手的填充玩偶
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:

100
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,130
尼啾无尾熊 会说「我喜欢你」
Nigel, the "l-Like-You" Koala.

101
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,600
瞧，亲爱的，它会说话耶  我是小可爱，我爱你
Look, honey! The crazy thing talks!  I'm so cuddly! I like you!

102
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,870
没错，他超可爱的 更赞的是，他喜欢你
That's right. He's so cuddly. And better yet, he likes you.

103
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,470
终于…
Finally.

104
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,810
动物园就快是咱们的天下了 倒数三秒
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three...

105
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,080
（纽约市立动物园）
...two...

106
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,310
两秒
...and showtime!

107
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,010
好戏上场！

108
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,820
我来也
Here I come!

109
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,380
谁把栅栏放在这儿？
Who put that bar there?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,490
好痒哦
That tickles!

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,400
我有啦  才没有
Did too!  Did not!

112
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,700
我有  才没有
Did too!  Did not!

113
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,000
给我让开，懒惰鬼
Out of my way, ya bum!

114
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,010
那个讨厌的无尾熊在哪里
There's that moth-eaten koala!

115
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,570
我跟你们这些火鹤说过一百遍 给我滚开
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.

116
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,580
我要签名  不行
How about an autograph?!  Don't...

117
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,050
各位鸟兄弟 帮我找他背后的拉线
Birds! Find the string on his back!

118
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,210
你今天的心情很好耶  各位
So you're havin' a really nice day!  Guys.

119
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,290
别碰我的副队长
Off my co-captain, now.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,820
抱歉，山大王
Sorry, Samson.

121
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,290
一点都不痛
That didn't hurt.

122
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,350
我差点忘了告诉你 我终于要约BJ出去
I almost forgot to tell you. I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.

123
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,100
等一下，罗密欧 你是只松鼠，她可是…
Slow down, Romeo. You are a squirrel and she is...

124
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,160
跟我很速配，对吧？
Perfect, right?

125
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,470
我懂你的意思啦 相信我，我的眼睛是雪亮的
Look, I know what you're sayin'. Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.

126
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,940
走路不长眼啊，你这大…
Watch where you're goin', you big...!

127
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,680
别盯着我的斑点看，斑尼 我的眼睛在上面
BJ Bridget.

128
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,680
Don't stare at my spots, Benny. My eyes are up here.

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,020
当然了，歹势哦 这是送你的，小亲亲
Of course. I'm so sorry. Oh, this is for you, honey.

130
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,360
可以戴在左脚上面
It goes around your left hoof.

131
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,160
你从垃圾堆捡来的吗？
Did you get that out of the trash?

132
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,500
就是了，你这捡垃圾的脏鬼
You did! You trash-picker!

133
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,130
我不是捡垃圾 我是在做资源回收
I'm not a trash-picker. I'm a recycler.

134
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,180
这样比较浪漫，不是吗？
That's a lot more romantic. Isn't it?

135
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,870
浪漫？  山大王，过来
Romantic?  Sam, come here.

136
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,410
浪漫？ 别跟我谈浪漫，斑尼
Romantic? Don't mention romance to me, Benny.

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,920
我从来没有交过男朋友  那正好
I've never had a boyfriend.  That settles it.

138
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,380
我自愿当你的第一位男友
I accept the job... of boyfriend number one.

139
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,250
斑尼，只有雌性圆网蜘蛛
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider

140
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,720
才会和比她小二十倍的 男生约会
will date a male one-twentieth her size.

141
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,260
我还是有希望  然后她会吃了他
So there's hope!  And then she eats him.

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,890
至少他死得很快乐
But at least he dies happy.

143
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,190
兄弟，我们去找雷恩
Let's get Ryan, dude!

144
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,930
兄弟，我们真有默契耶
Dude! We said that at the same time!

145
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,940
兄弟
Dude.

146
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,950

伊斯、杜克
Eze. Duke.

158
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,320
讨厌，他每次都猜对
Man, he always guesses.

159
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,200
大家都去看比赛 我们可以趁机追捕瞪羚
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.

160
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,170

165
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,410
冰龟锦标赛进入最后一局
We're into the final period of the curling championships

166
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,820
轮到企鹅队上场 维特要丢了
and the penguins are up. Here comes Victor.

167
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,190
好样的
What a beauty!

168
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,320
好耶，快刷呀
Yeah, sweep!

169
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,630
直接朝着红心滑过去 这次很可能直接命中目标
Heading straight for the bull's-eye! This could be it, folks!

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,630
命中目标  好耶！
Bo-wango!  Yes!

171
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,460
好耶  这下很难打败他们了
Oh, yeah!  That's gonna be tough to beat.

172
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,030
什么？「很难打败他们」？
What? "Tough to beat"?

173
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
这才是我们最爱的挑战 对吧，大伙儿？
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?

174
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,340
我不敢相信
I can't believe this!

175
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,140
如果输了，我就要拧断 我的脑袋，还有你的
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off! And yours!

176
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,510
咱们可不能输给那群 不会飞的笨鸟
We cannot lose to flightless birds!

177
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,850
拜托，咱们不会输了这场比赛
Whoa, whoa. No one is losing anything around here.

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,320
只要大家保持专注
As long as we stay focused.

179
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,150
对了，有人看到雷恩吗？  我知道了
By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?  Oh! I know!

180
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,320
也许他活在老爸阴影下 心情很郁卒
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow

181
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,520
而且他的吼声和女生一样逊
and he roars like a schoolgirl.

182
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,530
多谢了，赖瑞  不客气
Thanks, Lar.  You betcha!

183
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,700
尼啾，在我的玩偶上面签名

184
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,300
不要吧  尼啾，别理他们
Not again.  Nigel, ignore them.

185
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,970
我是小可爱，我爱你
I'm so cuddly! I like you!

186
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,440
你超可爱的，我们都爱你  够了，我一点都不可爱
You're so cuddly! We love you!  That's it! I am not cuddly!

187
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,880
我是来自伦敦街头 在道上混的丛林狠角色
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!

188
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,080
怕了吧  抓住他！抓住他！
Fear me!  Get him! Get him! Get him!

189
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,810
救命啊！  美眉们，把他放下来
Help me!  Girls! Put him down.

190
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,080
我不是玩偶
I am not a doll!

191
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,450
软绵绵的小屁屁  别摸我的屁股
Cushy tushy!  Leave my bum alone!

192
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,220
尼啾，别碰我的女朋友
Nigel! Get your paws off my girlfriend!

193
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,260
斑尼，我又不是你的女朋友
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!

194
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,060
好棒的一天哦
Really nice day!

195
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,970
山大王队是怎么了？ 逊毙了
What is up with Samson's team tonight? Brutal!

196
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,370
斑尼？
Benny?

197
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,640
天啊，谁会口对口人工呼吸？
Oh, my gosh! Who knows mouth-to-mouth?

198
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,970
我会
I do!

199
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,410
这算什么？
What was that?

200
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,880
你每天所需的斑尼维他命 宝贝儿
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.

201
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,180
给我滚开  我是小可爱，我爱你
Get off my nose.  I'm so cuddly, I like you!

202
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,080
给我闭嘴  你好，老兄
Stop saying that!  G'day, mate!

203
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,850
我要跳罗
Cannonball!

204
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,190
明年我只要当教练
Next year, I should just coach.

205
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,790
你看，汤氏瞪羚
Check it. The Thomson gazelle.

206
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,660
4点5秒内就能加速到 时速80公里
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.

207
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,760
速度最快的逃命高手  无人可比
The ultimate fleeing machine.  There is no substitute.

208
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,140
咱们靠近一点看看这群瘦子
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.

209
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,700
这样好吗？  当然好
Shall we?  I think we shall.

210
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,770
也许应该去看比赛
Maybe we should just go to the game.

211
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,110
你不是想当野蛮动物吗？  你老爸也追过瞪羚
I thought you wanted to be wild.  Your dad chased gazelles.

212
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,170
如果他在我们这年纪 一定会跟我们一起大玩特玩
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.

213
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,220
他一定会把他们扑倒 把他们当成…
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...

214
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,450
瞪羚  没错，瞪羚之类的
Gazelles.  Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.

215
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,620
准备好了吗？
Ready, man?

216
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,420
最好还是不要啦
We'd better not.

217
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,090
干吗？你打算阻止我们吗？
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna stop us?

218
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,960
大伙儿  上吧
Guys, guys.  Here we go!

219
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,500
整场比赛的输赢 就看这一次
The whole series comes down to this throw!

220
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,500
我俩没有明天 不是你死就是我亡
There's no tomorrow! It's do or die!

221
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,060
你们懂我的意思啦
Ya know what I mean.

222
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,130
大伙儿，我知道我们落后 不过我们会反败为胜
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out

223
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,110
因为我们要使出
'cause we're gonna use...

224
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,740
…秘密绝招  秘密绝招！
...the secret play.  The secret play!

225
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,010
大伙儿，猜怎么着？ 我们要用秘密绝招耶
Hey, everybody, guess what? We're gonna use the secret play!

226
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,110
赖瑞 秘密绝招最重要的一件事
Larry, the first part of the secret play

227
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,750
就是要保守秘密
is keeping it secret.

228
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,150
好啦  跟着我
OK.  Follow my lead.

229
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,850
大家要加倍努力
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.

230
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,690
没问题，队长 三倍努力都行
Absolutely, captain. Triple effort if you want, sir.

231
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
很好，预备…  散开
Good. Ready, and...  Break!

232
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,430
安静
Quiet.

233
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,990
我数到三 一、二…
On three, dude. One, two...

234
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,470
不！
No!

235
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,410
这下被你搞砸了，雷恩
Now you did it, Ryan.

236
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,010
你够狠吗，阿诺？
Feelin' mean, Donald?

237
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,380
放马过来吧
Bring it on!

238
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,820
各位，山大王的压力很大
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!

239
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,980
准备好了吗，BJ？  好了
Ready, Bridget?  Ready.

240
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,550
斑尼，你呢？  准备好了
Ready, Benny?  Ready!

241
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,000
山大王，可惜你那小鬼 没来看你输得惨兮兮
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.

242
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,660
我撑不下去了
I can't... hold it!

243
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,800
噢，不，你在干吗？
Oh, no! What are you doin'?

244
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,370
山大王要丢了 大家看看他有多猛
And here comes Samson. Look at that guy.

245
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,410
他是不是帅呆了？
Is he a beauty or what?

246
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,540
赖瑞！BJ！快刷！
Larry! Bridget! Sweep!

247
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,210
真有一套
What a recovery!

248
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,250
他派BJ和赖瑞上场
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!

249
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,410
刷快点，赖瑞！ 快刷，快刷！
Sweep faster, Larry! Sweep, sweep!

250
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,250
我在刷呀  加油
I am!  Come on, man!

251
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,760
企鹅队派出他们的王牌维特
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...

252
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,490
小心，维特  你自己才要小心
Watch it, Victor!  Watch it yourself, see?

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,690
尼啾，情况如何？
Nigel, how are we looking?

254
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,830
大伙儿，情况不妙  刷刷刷，刷刷刷
This could be trouble, folks!  Sweep, sweep, sweep.

255
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,240
这是作弊，你们死定了
This is cheating and you will die for this.

256
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,030
我听不到，尼啾
I can't hear you, Nigel.

257
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,700
往左一点点
Move left a bit...

258
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,580
很好，往左然后用力一击
OK. Move left and hit!

259
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,280
赖瑞，不要  大力一挥
Larry, no!  Tallyho!

260
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,080
好漂亮的动作
What a move!

261
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,760
各位，再过几寸 这将是冰龟大赛
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset

262
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,090
史上最精采的反败为胜
in turtle-curling history!

263
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,630
糟了，我不敢相信我看到的  不！
Oh, no! I can't believe my eyes!  No!

264
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,720
看来山大王凸槌了
Looks like Samson might have choked!

265
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,930
漂亮  好耶
Nice!  Yes!

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
真是不可思议
Unbelievable!

267
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,970
山大王和他的队友 一举夺下冠军
Samson and his team have clinched the title!

268
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,880
等等，我话说的太早了  搞什么鬼？
No, wait! I've called it too soon!  What the heck?

269
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,940
企鹅队赢了 他们首度夺下冠军
The penguins have done it! They're zoo champs for the first time!

270
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,580
群兽逃窜？群兽逃窜！
Stampede? Stampede!

271
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,190
拜托，停下来
Please! Stop!

272
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,060
小心
Watch out!

273
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,980
兄弟，我们被逮到了
Dude. Busted.

274
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,770
事情大条了
Catastrophic.

275
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,910
我说过会来看比赛
Told you I'd come to the game.

276
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,420
你觉得这样很好玩？
You think this is funny?

277
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,780
你差点把动物园的动物都害惨
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!

278
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,320
抱歉  你为什么道歉？
I'm sorry.  For what?

279
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,980
为了追赶瞪羚 还是害我们输掉比赛？
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?

280
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,080
你只会躲在树上垂头丧气
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.

281
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,130
如果你…  你到底怎么啦？
If you just...  What's the problem?

282
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,090
只因为你不会吼吗？
Is all this because you can't roar?

283
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,630
雷恩，我不是故意的
Ryan, I didn't mean that.

284
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,170
你知道我为什么躲在树上 成天垂头丧气吗？
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?

285
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,800
我真希望万兽之王 山大王不是我老爸
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.

286
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,370
雷恩，我不是…
Ryan, I didn't...

287
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,310
这样大家就不会瞧不起 我这个逊脚雷恩
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.

288
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,210
雷恩，对不起
Ryan, I'm sorry.

289
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,770
雷恩，求求你
Ryan! Please don't...

290
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,720
…别走
...leave.

291
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,120
拜了，雷恩 多谢你来看比赛
Bye, Ryan! Thanks for coming to the game.

292
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,990
你还怕他不来
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.

293
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,060
真是的 没有人肯听松鼠的话
Not good. No one listens to the squirrel.

294
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,610
我不知道该怎么办，斑尼
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.

295
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,940
我什么方法都试过了  真的吗？
I've tried everything.  Everything?

296
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,310
你什么方法都试过？  你想说什么？
You tried everything?  What are you saying?

297
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,900
我只想说你要告诉他实话
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.

298
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,920
我不能说实话，斑尼
I don't think I could do that, Benny.

299
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,580
我是说…
I mean...

300
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,450
他知道真相后会怎么想？
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?

301
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,980
我也不知道
I don't know.

302
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,320
不过如果你不告诉他
But if you don't tell him...

303
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,730
就会失去这个儿子
...you're gonna lose him, Sammy.

304

309
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,890
你以为我不知道吗？  走吧
You don't think I know that?  Get movin'!

310
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,730
我改变主意了，我不想走
I changed my mind! I don't wanna go!

311
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,830
救命啊！

斑尼，我们要追踪那辆卡车  收到

谢了
Thanks.

329
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,690
阿山，你是史上最大的输家
Hamir! You are the great loser of all time!

330
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,700
我到底该奉献什么给你呢？
What offerings must I make, I wonder?

331
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,360
阿山！阿山！
Hamir! Hamir!

332
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
冷静一点
Get a grip on yourself!

333
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,710
斑尼，我要等到礼拜五 才能把钱还给你
Benny! I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!

334
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,240
不是啦，是雷恩
No, no. It's Ryan.

335
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,280
他被装进绿色箱子 被他们带走了
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!

336
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,780
我们一定要找到他
We've got to find him!

337
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,650
事情大条了，情况不妙
That is not good! Not good at all!

338
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,710
我知道啦
I know! I know!

339
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,720
我正在告诉他 你们这些起肖的鸽子
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!

340
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,920
绿色箱子会被带到大海
The green boxes go to the big water

341
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,520
海上有一个 头上有尖刺的女雕像
where stiff lady with spikes on her head...

342
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,430
阿山，我听不懂  尖刺呀！
Hamir? I can't understand...  Spikes!

343
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,160
告诉我绿色箱子去哪里
Just tell me where the green boxes go.

344
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,670
女雕像？尖刺？
Stiff lady, spikies?

345
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,500
没错，就像我太太说的
Yes, like my wife says,

346
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,450
卡车把他们载到她那里
the truck takes them to her! To her!

347
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,750
虽然我只喜欢报喜不报忧 不过我有更多坏消息
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.

348
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,920
天一亮，绿色箱子 就要搭船离开永远不会回来
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!

349
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,120
（动物园到非洲拯救行动）

350
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,830
真的很遗憾，我很难过
I am sorry for this. I really am.

351
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,800
有人在吗？
Hello?

352
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,560
惨了，情况不妙
No. Not good. Not good.

353
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,440
你老是这么说
You always say that.

354
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,910
我老是这么说，可是没人肯听
I keep on sayin' it. No one's listenin'.

355
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,910
就像一张跳针的老唱片
Like a broken record here.

356
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,780
山大王，我们几时出发？
OK. When do we leave, Sammy?

357
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,180
对啊，我们几时出发？
Yeah, when do we leave?

358
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,840
不是我们，只有我 搞清楚
It's not "we." It's me. Let's make this clear.

359
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,980
这是拯救行动 要去的只有我一个
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.

360
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,520
我们也要去，我们都不怕
We'll come too! We're not afraid.

361
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,850
对吧，大伙儿？
Are we, guys?

362
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,660
怕？当然不怕罗
Afraid? No.

363
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,460
你们知道无尾熊嘛 我们只会发抖
You know koalas. More like "scared of things."

364
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,230
雷恩就像咱们自己的小孩
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.

365
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,860
不过看来我这辈子 是不会有自己的小孩了
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.

366
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,770
有一只有名的无尾熊说过
You know, there's that famous... A koala once said,

367
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,200
「我们要用…水蜜桃打他们」
"We will fight them... with peaches."

368
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,670
是哦，言归正传
Yeah. Anyway.

369
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,800
不管怎样，我们都要帮忙  你们要跟我来？好吧
So we're helping, whatever it takes.  You want to leave with me? OK.

370
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,340
如果你们不怕被猎捕、射杀
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...

371
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,040
…被做成标本的话  好吧
...stuffed...  OK!

372
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,140
或是更惨的事，那就来吧
...or worse, then fine.

373
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,590
我经常做的恶梦就是 被剥皮和去斑
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.

374
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,560
他们想抓到我门儿都没有 我跑得超快的
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.

375
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,720
除了我谁都不能去，了吗？
Nobody's leaving but me. Got it?

376
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,370
你才是老大  没错
You're the boss.  You bet.

377

你是万兽之王嘛  一点也没错
You got the big hair.  Absolutely.

378
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,900
好耶，好伎俩，山大王
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.

379
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,440
先把最弱的成员踢掉
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.

380
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,340
他们不会碍事了 你有什么计划？
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?

Don't worry about a thing, big guy.

383

We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights,

387

什么？  我们是来帮你找到雷恩
What?  We're going to help you find Ryan!

她说 「我们要帮你找到雷恩」
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."

太好了  喂，大伙儿
Oh, great.  Hey, guys.

I've got popcorn up my bum.

394

（爆米花）
Do I look trashy in this?

395
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,370
我穿这样会不会很俗？

396
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,370
好吧，这是我的…
OK, here's my...

397
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,900
这是我的通盘计划 我们到底要去哪儿呀？
Here's my overall plan. Where are we going?

398
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,140
天亮之前如果不救出雷恩 他就永远不会回来
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!

399

现在我还要担心你们三个？
And now I have to worry about you three?

400
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,990
好吧，斑尼，我们几时下车？
All right, fine. When do we get off of this thing, Benny?

这下好了，现在怎么办？
Great. Now what am I gonna do?

406

她说「蹲下来」
She said, "Duck down!"

I am not in the mood for a game of footsie

411
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,310
或是动蹄动掌的游戏
or hoofsie or pawsie or...

412
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,550
那不是我的脚掌，是这玩意儿
That wasn't my paw. It was this!

413
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,960
我不是偷来的，是借来了
I didn't steal it. I borrowed it.

414
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,020

00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,260
赖瑞，那是你吗？
Is that you, Larry?

441
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,490
我在上面，尼啾
Up here, Nige.

442
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,960
你这条蛇的毛还真多耶
You're a very furry snake.

443
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,970
大伙儿，不要太引人注目
Guys... We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.

444
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,940
小狗狗，山大王 你一定觉得很好玩
Dogs. This should be fun for you, Samson.

445
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,600
尼啾，抓住BJ！
Nigel! Grab Bridget!

446
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,870
什么？  快跑呀！
What?  Run!

447
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,350
我要吐了，我要吐了
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

448
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,150
你不是应该 把他们撕成碎片吗？
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?

449
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,460
这是计划的一部份 这一招叫赛伦盖提脱逃术
All part of the plan. This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.

450
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,050
「掠食动物教战手册」第十页
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.

451
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,660
现在怎么办？
What next?

452
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,930
第十一页？
Page 11?

453
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,470
尽管笑吧，杂种狗
Go on, you mutts!

454
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,870
笨狗狗，我们大可以教训你们
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.

455
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,970
教你们…跳迪斯可
Taken you to a... To a disco!

456
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,340
赖瑞，想想办法
Larry, improvise!

457
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,680
赖瑞，你愈帮愈忙  好吧
Larry, that's not helping.  OK.

458
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,060
你们这些逊狗以为很会狗叫？ 山大王可是会狮子吼耶
You dogs think you got bark? Well, Samson's got roar!

459
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,290
让他们瞧瞧你的厉害  秀出你的本领
Show 'em, Sam.  Dig deep, Samson.

460
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,890
你是一头狮子，大显神威吧
You're a lion. Be a lion.

461
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,960
看看那家伙
Look at that guy!

462
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,930
山大王，他们口吐白沫
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.

463
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,330
好吧
OK...

464
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,140
赖瑞，卷起来  收到
Larry, coil!  Check!

465
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,510
山大王  这是随机应变，快跳啊
Sam!  I improvised. Now jump!

466
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,920
跳下去？  对
Down there?  Yes!

467
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,990
我们要走了哦，赖瑞
We're leaving, Larry!

468
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,900
山大王，我只想问你哦 你碰到刚才那些狗
Teensy question, Samson. With those dogs up there,

469
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,970
为什么不像你在 大草原那样对付他们？
why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?

470
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,040
你知道嘛 冲上去把他们扑倒
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them

471
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,710
把他们吓得皮皮挫？
or lionify them?

472
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,160
我没时间和小狗穷磨菇
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.

473
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,420
我们得找到雷恩，记得吗？
We have to find Ryan, remember?

474
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,590
这是什么鬼地方？
What is this stinky place?

475
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,820
这地方
Lt...

476
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,960
…看起来是人类洗澡的地方
...appears to be a human bathing area.

477
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,970
你是说人类 不是把自己舔干净？
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?

478
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,500
真恶心
Disgusting!

479
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,440
他们真是无药可救 很难想像他们在统治世界
They're hopeless. It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.

480
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,270
我无法想像 他们从不把自己舔干净
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.

481
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,840
我不是在催你哦 不过你有计划吗？
No hurry, but is there a plan?

482
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,320
当然有罗
Of course there's a plan.

483
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,780
我们沿着这条水道到大海
We follow this water to the big water,

484
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,910
然后找到那个…
and then we find the lady with...

485
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,590
赖瑞，如果不是你肚子在叫 就是你肚子里有东西在叫
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.

486
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,320
又不是我
Wasn't me.

487
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,060
干吗？
What?

488
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,840
干得好，尼啾  哇塞，双胞胎耶
Smooth move, Nigel!  Oh, boy! Twins!

489
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,380
山大王，快一点 这两个家伙
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys

490
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,920
…好像肚子很饿
are seeming to have acid reflux or something!

491
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,540
大伙儿冷静点
Everybody... stay calm.

492
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,180
冷静？  不好了
Calm?  Not good.

493
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,160
喂，吓你们的啦
Yo. Boo!

494
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,490
你和你的麻吉们好像
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here

495
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,430
…离你们的家园太远了吧
are a little far from your borough.

496
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,300
离你们的家园太远了  好好笑哦
Far from your borough! I love it.

497
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,030
我们要去大海那边
We're going to the big water.

498
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,510
尼啾，比一比我们要找什么
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.

499
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,640
像这样吗？  她是用右手拿
Like this?  I think it's in her right hand.

500
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,220
她不是蓝色的吗？  我不会变色
And isn't she blue?  I can't do blue.

501
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,080
你不知道吧？  完全没印象
No idea. You?  Doesn't even register.

502
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,750
你比得超逊的  不然就比…
You're battin' zero, kid.  Do the thing with...

503
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,820
拜托你快点决定
Make your bloody mind up.

504
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,700
头上有尖刺的那个女巨人
The big female with the spikes on her melon!

505
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,100
他们是观光客
They're tourists.

506
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,730
观光客，听好了 你们得去炮台公园
All right, tourists, listen up. Ya gotta get to Battery Park.

507
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,670
先钻进百老汇的排水沟
First take the Broadway culvert.

508
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,940
钻进百老汇的排水沟？  那有什么问题？
Down the Broadway culvert?  What's wrong with that?

509
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,670
他们会在废水处理厂迷路  少来了
They get lost at the sewage plant!  Get outta here!

510
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,210
你在说什么呀？  要不然要怎么走？
What are you talking about?  How would you send 'em?

511
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,840
你指的路不对啦
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!

512
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,750
华尔街在修路 排水沟被堵住了
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.

513
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,380
那也对  好吧
That is true.  All right.

514
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,010
两位，你们到底帮不帮忙？
Guys, you gonna help or not?

515
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,820
当然帮忙罗 我们一定会帮到底
Yeah, sure. Of course we're gonna help ya's.

516
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,090
咱们都是一家人，对吧？
We're one big family, right?

517
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,420
除了那个家伙 他把我给吓…
Except for that guy there. He scares the...

518
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,060
你有完没完呀，卡麦？
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine? Are ya?

519
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,860
抱歉，他曾经被冲下马桶 到现在还余悸犹存
I apologize. He never got over being flushed down the toilet.

520
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,890
是啊
Yeah.

521
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,630
跟我来，你们在这里 肯定活不了十分钟
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.

522
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,140
这地方是大草原
It's a jungle down here.

523
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,510
史旦，你知道他是谁吗？  什么？不知道
Stan, you know who that is?  What? No.

524
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,980
他是会说话的无尾熊
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!

525
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,710
你好吗？
How ya doing?

526
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,980
我超可爱的，我喜欢你
I'm so cuddly! I like you!

527
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,280
我看过一大堆无尾熊玩偶 从下水道流下来
I've seen a lot of those things floatin' here in the sewer.

528
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,260
超好笑的 你害我笑到不行
That's good! You're makin' me laugh over here.

529
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,020
等等我
Just wait for me!

530
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,940
我们来对地方了吗？
Are we in the right place?

531
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,410
只要没有那两只搞笑的鳄鱼
Any place without two hilarious alligators

532
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,410
应该就对了
seems a move in the right direction.

533
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,350
山大王，你看到什么吗？  看到了
Sam, do you see anything up there?  I sure do.

534
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,880
她就在那里 就跟阿山说的一样
Well, well, well. There she is, like Hamir said.

535
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,980
天亮了 咱们的时间不多了
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.

536
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,430
大伙儿，听好 雷恩被关在绿色箱子
Guys, look. We know the box Ryan's in is green.

537
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,120
一定就在这附近 我要你们…
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...

538
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,530
知道啦，看到箱子就大叫
Yeah. So we should shout out if we see a box

539
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,760
就像那边的那些箱子
that looks like the ones over there.

540
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,160
还没运走，我们追得回来
It hasn't left yet! We can make it!

541
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,140
快走吧  抓紧了，赖瑞
Let's go!  Hold on, Larry!

542
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,010
往哪儿走？  对啊，哪儿？
Which way now?  Yeah, which way?

543
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,450
快跑！
Run!

544
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,680
不！
No!

545
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,350
不！
No!

546
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,020
雷恩在那上面
Ryan's on that thing!

547
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,650
我们一定要阻止它
We've got to stop it!

548
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,860
不行啦，山大王  我不管
We can't, Sam!  I don't care!

549
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,420
不行啦，你会淹死的 山大王！
No, Sammy, you'll drown!  Sam!

550
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,070
我又失败了
I failed. Again.

551
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,270
我只失败过这么一次
I only count one failure.

552
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,980
彻底的大失败 不过就这么一次
It's big, but it's just one.

553
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,080
再见了，雷恩 我们会很想念你
Goodbye, Ryan. We're gonna miss ya.

554
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,920
山大王！  这到底是怎么回事？
Samson!  What on earth is going on?

555
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,090
那是个人类 他不是替动物园工作
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.

556
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,720
也许现在应该要随机应变
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.

557
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,130
什么？
What?

558
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,640
太好了，解决了一个问题
Great! One problem down...

559
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,180
棒呆了
Far out.

560
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,770
酷哦
Cool.

561
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,710
又遇上一个大灾难
One disaster to go.

562
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,620
你在干什么？ 我们要撞上另一艘船了
What are you doing? We're headed for the other boat!

563
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,860
这要怎么开呀？ 谁知道要怎么开船？
How do we steer? Who knows how to steer?

564
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,630
谁都不会 我们只是动物，这下可好了
None of us. We're animals. Great!

565
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,570
等等，赖瑞，再做一次  做什么？
Hold on, Larry. Do that again.  Do what?

566
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,780
你刚才那样 不过这次要反方向
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!

567
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,440
我不知道反方向是哪里
But I don't know my opposites!

568
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,880
不对，像这样
No, Larry, like this!

569
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,870
我好像学会了
I think I've got it.

570
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,130
很简单嘛
Well, that was easy.

571
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,400
天啊，谁有尤加利叶？ 我要擦屁屁
Oh, dear. Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?

572
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,640
这并不难嘛
This isn't so difficult.

573
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,700
我是大海的狮王
I'm the lion of the sea!

574
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,300
干得好
Well done, sir.

575
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,580
你是咱们的队长 现在是这艘船的船长
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.

576
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,680
你超棒的
You're brilliant.

577
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,520
我不想扫兴 不过在一片混乱中
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee,

578
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,530
我们把雷恩的船追丢了
we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.

579
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,720
什么？啥都没有？  对，它不见了
What, nothing?  Nothing. He's gone.

580
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,730
不
No.

581
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,270
那里，尼森，绿色箱子
There! Nelson! The green boxes!

582
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,640
你确定？  我的麻吉在那里
You're sure, eh?  And there's my buddies!

583
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,810
还有我的最爱
And my love!

584
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,280
我们下去吧
Let's go in!

585
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,950
我们要背着太阳走  不，要朝着太阳往北走
We'll head away from the sun.  No, towards the sun. To the north.

586
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,080
右舷…左舷
Starboard... Leftboard.

587
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,820
跟着我的指头就对了
Just follow my finger.

588
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,090
拜托，就算答案从天而降
Please. You guys wouldn't know the answer

589
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
打到你们头上 你们也不会知道
if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.

590
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,620
天啊，有一只蝙蝠
Oh, my! It's a bat! It's a bat!

591
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,690
快把他弄掉，快弄掉
Get it off me! Get it off me!

592
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,810
斑尼！  斑尼？
Benny!  Benny?

593
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,100
天鹅！
Geese!

594
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:23,050
你没事吧？  没事，我的公主
Are you all right?  Yes, my princess.

595
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,810
斑尼，你来了
Benny, you made it!

596
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,750
你们是我的好朋友 好朋友应该团结一致
You're my best friend. Best friends should stick together.

597
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,760
就算不怎么好的朋友也要
Even not-so-best friends,

598
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,260
竟然把我 从急驶的垃圾车上踢下去
who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.

599
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,490
对不起啦 不过我求他们回去找你
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.

600
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,550
这一点我要说清楚哦
Just so you know.

601
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,600
斑尼，你在上面 看得到雷恩的船吗？
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?

602
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,730
我正好看到它往那里走
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.

603
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,270
而且我们很幸运
And we're in luck!

604
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,270
你们好吗？  加拿大野雁
How's it goin', eh?  Canadian geese!

605
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,210
勇闯天涯旅行专家
Experts at intercontinental travel.

606
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,940
嗨，小鸟，我问你哦
Hey, birdie, OK,

607
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,850
加拿大的移民政策 是不是对无尾熊特别宽待？
is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?

608
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
我问就好 我儿子被带走了
I'll take it from here. My son's out there.

609
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,620
我们真的需要你们帮忙 你们能带我们找到那艘船吗？
We really need your help. Can you lead us to that boat?

610
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,630
没问题，跟着我们就行了
No problem, eh? Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.

611
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,820
不要落后太远，好吗？
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?

612
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,990
斑尼，谢了
Hey, Benny, thanks.

613
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:21,940
对了，你掉下去的时候 BJ很担心你哦
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.

614
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,980
我打赌你一定不知道 我会骑野雁，对吧？
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?

615
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,410
厉害吧？  拜托
Bareback.  Oh, brother.

616
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,580
山大王？ 我们要去大草原吗？
Sammy? We going to the wild now?

617
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,320
应该是吧，赖瑞
I think we are, Larry.

618
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,040
（纽约大西洋）

619
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,850
我受不了了
I can't take it anymore.

620
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,860
他在耍我们，你们听
He's taunting us! Listen!

621
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,860
别再笑我们了，臭太阳
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!

622
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,530
山大王船长 有没有冰淇淋吃？
Captain Bligh, sir! Are the ice cream cones ready?

623
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,900
船员就快要发动叛变了
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.

624
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,060
尼啾，拜托
Nigel, please.

625
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,660
不给我们吃冰淇淋
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick,

626
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,470
我们就要逼你跳进大海
you're gonna walk the plank, sir!

627
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,530
尼啾  我不管我会不会淹死
Nigel.  I don't care if I drown,

628
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,200
我只想马上离开这艘幽灵船
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.

629
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,150
冰山！ 我要和这艘船共生死
Iceberg! Permission to go down with the ship, sir.

630
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,980
等一下，这话我收回
Hang on! Stuff that!

631
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,320
快跑啊！游泳！
Run! Swim!

632
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,520
尼啾？
Nigel?

633
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,890
瞧，我是海星耶
Look, I'm a starfish.

634
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,090
大伙儿，你们看
Guys, look.

635
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,620
天啊，你一定觉得 花了一辈子才到
Gosh. Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.

636
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,640
是啊，一辈子
Yeah... a lifetime.

637
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,710
搞什么鬼？
What the heck?

638
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,020
哇，你们看
Wow! Look!

639
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,490
他们把绿色箱子放回大草原
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.

640
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,750
赖瑞  大伙儿
Larry.  Guys,

641
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,350
他们把动物又装进绿色箱子
they're putting animals inside the green boxes.

642
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,560
我搞不懂为什么
I just can't figure out why.

643
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,660
那是通往另一个空间的通道
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?

644
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,530
他们先进去…  这家伙是谁？
They go in...  Who is this guy?

645
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,860
没关系，尼啾
It's all right, Nigel.

646
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,340
你想这跟那玩意有关吗？
Think it has anything to do with that?

647
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,210
等一下，如果我不是饿昏了头 就是赖瑞说的有道理
Hang on a second. Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.

648
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,680
你说得对 有人在拯救那些动物
You're right. Those animals are being rescued.

649
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,460
雷恩？
Ryan?

650
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,230
雷恩！
Ryan!

651
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,600
噢，不！
Oh, no!

652
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,590
雷恩！
Ryan!

653
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,670
我们要快一点
We've got to move fast!

654
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,470
雷恩！
Ryan!

655
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,180
雷恩！雷恩！
Ryan! Ryan!

656
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,520
雷恩！ 儿子，你在哪里？
Ryan! Where are you, buddy?

657
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,450
雷恩！
Ryan!

658
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,220
我不敢相信  山大王
I can't believe it!  Samson!

659
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,590
我离他这么近，他就在那里
I was so close. He was right there!

660
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,830
现在找不到他了  过来
We'll never find him now!  Come here!

661
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,170
冷静一点，用你的直觉
Will you get a hold of yourself? Use your instincts.

662
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,730
我不想再跑了
I don't want to run anymore.

663
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,370
那敢情好，老实说 你需要好一点的运动内衣
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.

664
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,410
雷恩？  一切都能搞定
Ryan?  Everything's under control.

665
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,380
失败只是暂时的  我闻到了
Temporary setback.  I got it.

666
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,380
我闻到雷恩的味道  他闻到了？
I got Ryan's scent!  He got it?

667
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,880
他闻到了耶！快走吧！
I mean, he got it! Let's go!

668
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,280
万岁！  等等我们！
Hooray!  Wait for us!

669
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,550
我不是赛跑选手 我需要一辆车
I'm not designed for this! I want a car.

670
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,160
大伙儿，我找到他了 雷恩！
Hey, guys, I found him! Ryan!

671
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,630
你们不敲门的吗？
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

672
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,960
我儿子呢？ 他有没有来过这里？
Where's my son? Did he come through here?

673
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,030
对哦，我想起来了 他是来过这里，哈罗
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here. Hello?

674
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,010
出来吧，小狮子 你老爸来了
Come on out, baby lion! Your dad's here!

675
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,340
有没有看到 这儿有一大堆狮子
Well, what do you know? There's a whole pride of lions here!

676
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,180
臭死了 我以为你闻到雷恩的味道
Funky. I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent,

677
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,740
不是这个臭得要命的家伙
not this olfactory insult.

678
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,980
我…
I...

679
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,960
我本来闻到雷恩的味道 不过我的掠食动物本能发作
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since,

680
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,020
因为我有好久没吃东西了
you know, I haven't eaten for a while.

681
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,530
一点也没错
Exactly!

682
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,390
你永远不知道 掠食动物的本能几时发作
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.

683
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,060
太好了，棒呆了
Excellent. Fantastic!

684
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,000
我们终于要看到 传奇的山大王发威
We get to see the legend in action.

685
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,130
我也很想呀，不过没时间了
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.

686
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,470
当然有时间，山大王
We got the time, Sammy. Just...

687
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,810
你先这样，然后再这样
And then you do this. And then this bit.

688
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,700
一口把他撕裂
Rip him apart!

689
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,210
超恐怖的
The horror.

690
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,450
我不忍心看，不过一定要看
I can't bear to watch! But I have to.

691
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,630
走吧，快走吧
Go on. Get out of here.

692
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,890
山大王把晚餐放走了  真是的
The legend dropped his dinner.  Oh, boy.

693
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,700
怎么了？ 我不够好，你不屑吃我？
What's wrong? I'm not good enough for you to eat?

694
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,070
不是啦，我只是对疯子过敏
No. It's just I'm allergic to nuts.

695
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,840
我了了，你要先耍我，是吗？
Now I get it. You're gonna toy with me?

696
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,970
先打我几下，然后放我走 趁我戒心解除了再扑上来？
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?

697
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,740
好刺激哦
How exciting.

698
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,650
来吧，雷恩应该就在附近
Come on, guys. Ryan can't be far.

699
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,380
我还没说完耶 我可是顶极佳肴哦
Hey! I'm not finished with you! I am a delicacy.

700
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,440
我的肉吃起来有果香和木头香
My flesh has fruity wood notes!

701
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,290
说话小心点，开胃菜 他可是万兽之王山大王
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre. That's Samson the Wild.

702
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,880
他是万兽之王？
You call this wild?

703
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,290
我看他是只猫吧 一只又肥又弱的病猫
This is a cat! A big, fat, tame pussycat!

704
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,270
好了，够了  病猫在吓唬我耶
OK, that's enough!  The pussycat hissed at me!

705
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,170
也许我应该躲在无尾熊后面 让他保护我
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.

706
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,870
这样好了 你要不要赏我几巴掌？
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?

707
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,340
不要，你是笨蛋吗？
No. What are you, a twit?

708
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,810
别理他  算了，我要闪了
Ignore him.  Don't bother! I'm leaving.

709
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,000
你是个怪胎  快逃命啊！
You're weird.  Run for your lives!

710
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,170
吃斋念佛的狮子来了！
It's a lion with moral issues!

711
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,350
我也受够你们了
And I've had it with you too!

712
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,150
多谢你们破坏我今天的心情
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!

713
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,010
我有个小疑问
Teensy question.

714
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,420
这算是问题也算是批评
Or more like a... a sort of a query meets a statement.

715
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,290
刚才那只蹄兔
That hyrax back there?

716
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,630
你好像不太忍心吃他耶
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.

717
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,130
是啊，还有那些狗 你也没有对他们大开吃戒
Yeah, and what about those dogs? There was no munching there, either.

718
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,070
要不是我很了解你 我会以为你是…
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...

719
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,570
…素食动物  才不是
A vegetarian?  Nope.

720
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,700
我不是那个意思啦  你本来想说的是…
That's not what I was going to say.  You were going to say...

721
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,970
你好像…  你好像不是来自…
It's almost like...  You're not from...

722
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,840
大草原？
The wild?

723
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,950
没错，我不是来自大草原
Well, you're right. I'm not from the wild.

724
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,450
什么？
What?

725
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,520
我是个冒牌货
I'm just a phony.

726
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,320
老实说，我保护不了你们
Truth is I can't protect you out here.

727
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,860
你们赶快回到船上
Please just go back to the boat.

728
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,190
我得去找我儿子
I've got to find my son.

729
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,060
难道我们在危险的大草原 要靠八寸高的松鼠保护吗？
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.

730
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,080
其实我是九寸高 除此之外，你说得对
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.

731
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,080
所以这代表…
So that means...

732
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,550
我们死定了！
We are going to die!

733
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,750
大伙儿！
Hey, guys! Guys!

734
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,520
你们三个冷静一点，好吗？
Will the three of you calm down?

735
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,020
他怎么能骗我们？
How could he lie to us?

736
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,750
我们是他最好的朋友耶  是啊
We're his best friends.  Sure.

737
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,700
也许他不想说出实话 所以才骗我们
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.

738
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,230
好吧，不管怎样
OK, yeah, whatever. Whatever.

739
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,430
我们回船上去吧
Let's just go back to the boat, then.

740
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,940
野性大发、所向无敌… 胡说八道
The fierce, the proud, the wild... Rubbish!

741
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,600
等等，等等 你们要去哪里？
But wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Where you goin'?

742
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,140
站住，站住
Stop right there! Stop!

743
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,150
BJ，如果你走了，我就…
Bridget, if you go, I'm...

744
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,150
我就跟你分手
I'm breaking up with you.

745
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,380
我们从来就没有在一起过
We were never going out in the first place.

746
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,940
那我们就暂时分开一阵子
Then we're taking a break.

747
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,510
尼啾！  好啦！
Nigel!  All right!

748
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,350
听好
Hey, listen!

749
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,790
我知道你们很害怕 至少我们可以互相照应
I know you're scared. But at least we got each other.

750
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,390
山大王就孤零零一个
Sammy's got nobody. He's out there all alone.

751
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,130
而且…雷恩也是
And... so is Ryan.

752
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,200
好吧，专心一点
OK, OK, focus, Samson.

753
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,870
他应该就在这附近 你一定会找到他
He's got to be out there somewhere. You'll find him.

754
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,470
这地方会有多大，对吧？
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?

755
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,560
雷恩！
Ryan!

756
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,070
嗨，小朋友 你也迷路了吗？
Hey there, little fella. You're lost too, huh?

757
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,980
你让我想到家乡的同伴
You remind me of my buddy back home.

758
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,680
这只凶猛嗜血的野兽
A bloodthirsty monster!

759
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,020
哪里？哪里？
Where? Where?

760
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,720
他是掠食猛兽 离我的宝贝孩子远一点
He's a killer! Get away from my baby!

761
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,920
女士，冷静点
Calm down, lady!

762
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,400
快来救我的孩子呀
Won't anyone save my baby?

763
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,130
拜了
Bye-bye.

764
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,670
雷恩！雷恩！
Ryan! Ryan!

765
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,000
山大王！
Sammy!

766
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,540
我根本不适合野外生活
I wasn't meant for the wild.

767
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,240
我天生气质出众、动作优雅
I was made to nibble and be elegant

768
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,940
我在儿童绘本总是美丽大方
and to appear in children's books as the letter G.

769
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,110
别紧张，这里并不可怕
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?

770
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,780
只有树叶和藤蔓还有…
It's just leaves and vines and...

771
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,220
那是我的脚
Oh, that's my foot.

772
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,350
尼啾，小心后面
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.

773
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,690
你也一样，赖瑞  没问题
You too, Larry!  Okeydokey.

774
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,500
我知道了，好吧
Oh, I see. All right, OK, yeah.

775
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:18,520
你在跟我打冷战 我才不在乎呢
You're giving me the silent treatment. Like I care.

776
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,540
尼啾，我对你下命令
Nigel! I gave you an order.

777
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,570
你说声「遵命，长官」 会怎样吗？
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?

778
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,970
尼啾
Nigel.

779
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,180
这样不好笑，尼啾
That's not funny, Nigel.

780
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,650
他不见了，我们完蛋了  尼啾！
He's gone! We're doomed.  Nigel!

781
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,650
先是雷恩，然后是山大王 现在又轮到尼啾
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!

782
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,280
我觉得动物园比较好
I do believe in zoos.

783
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,720
赖瑞，你在抓狂  是真的，真的
Larry, you're tensing up!  I do, I do, I do.

784
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,520
别紧张，这儿有我在  所以我们才紧张
Don't panic. I'm in charge.  That's why we're panicking!

785
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,750
咱们散开来围一个圈
I say we fan out and circle.

786
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,760
我们是孔雀吗？ 我们又不是扇子，快跑吧
What are we, peacocks? We don't fan, we run.

787
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,490
快逃命啊，大伙儿！
Run for your lives, everybody!

788
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,590
大伙儿，我有个主意 咱们何不问问他们？
Guys, I've got an idea. Why don't we ask them?

789
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,200
放心，他们有蹄
It's OK... They, you see, they got hooves.

790
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,370
这代表他们不吃肉 只吃草
That means they don't hunt. They graze.

791
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,380
可是他们在舔下巴耶
But they're licking their chops.

792
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,680
我对付膝盖怪怪的那个
I'll take the one with the funny knees.

793
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,180
膝盖怪怪的？
The funny knee...?

794
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,120
斑尼，不！
Benny, no!

795
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,590
斑尼？
Benny?

796
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,360
抓住他们
Get them.

797
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,230
退后，对不起
Just, hey, back off. I'm sorry,

798
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,960
我不是那种乱搞的无尾熊
I'm not that kind of koala bear.

799
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,040
是哦
Right.

800
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,440
对不起，你好 很抱歉打扰了你
Excuse me? Hello? Terribly sorry to bother you,

801
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,310
你会说无尾熊语吗？
but do you speak koala? Sprechen Sie koala?

802
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,190
好吧
Right.

803
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:53,490
拜托你能不能 不要去冒烟的地方？
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?

804
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,830
朋友，你好 朋友，你好
G'day, mate G'day, mate

805
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,530
朋友，你好 朋友，你好
G'day, mate G'day, mate

806
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,400
朋友，你好 朋友，你好
G'day, mate G'day, mate

807
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,600
在这地方开派对好怪哦
What a strange place for a party.

808
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,750
不错，很有秩序
Very good, very organized.

809
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,450
我能借用厕所吗？
Can I use your toilet?

810
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,320
今天真是个
I'm having a

大家一起来  开怀大笑，开怀大笑
Why don't you all  Tickle away, tickle away

817
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,140
他们是可怕的怪物
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts...

818
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,940
不过舞跳得还不错
...but they're not bad dancers.

819
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,480
我是小可爱，我爱你
I'm so cuddly I like you

820
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,020
我是小可爱，我爱你
I'm so cuddly I like you

821
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,880
向前踢，向侧踢、向前走
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.

822
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,010
今天真是个  美好的一天
I'm having a  Really nice day

823
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,390

我是小可爱，我爱你  祝你愉快
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day

826
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,360
那是什么东西？  我是蛮牛
What is that?  I am Kazar.

827
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,700
领袖、先知
Leader. Prophet.

828
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,500
编舞老师
Choreographer.

829
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,340
因为有你们 我也是肉食动物
And with your help... carnivore!

830
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,670
不！不要吃我！ 我吃的苦够多了！
No! Don't kill me! I've had such a weird life!

831
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,410
这不公平
This is not fair.

832
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,950
我知道了，这是瑜珈营
Oh, I get it. A yoga retreat.

833
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,760
雷恩！
Ryan!

834
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,170
你办得到的，运用本能
You can do this. Use your instincts.

835
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,430
跟随你的直觉

836
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,270
跟随你的直觉
Follow your instincts.

837
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,660
运用本能
Use your instincts.

838
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,420
好吧
OK.

839
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,430
走这里
Down this way.

840
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,760
这里
This way.

841
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,530
小狮子
A lion cub.

842
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,590
我们得向蛮牛报告
We must tell Kazar.

843
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,830
轮到我向他报告  上次是你向他报告
It's my turn to tell him.  You got to last time.

844
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,600
才没有  有，就是你
No, I didn't.  Yes, you did!

845
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,770
多谢各位，不过我得走了
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.

846
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,280
无尾熊像工蜂一样忙碌
Koalas are very busy bees.

847
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,820
我自己出去就可以了
If I could... I'll just buzz along to the door...

848
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,080
数百年来 我们看着我们的同胞
For centuries, we've watched our brethren

849
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,590
死在狮子的利爪之下
perish at the claw of the lion.

850
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,350
今天我们要报一箭之仇
Today, we put our hooves down.

851
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:17,390
我们再也不要待在 食物链的最底层
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.

852
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,800
没错，很有志气
Well, yes. I should say so.

853
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,240
我们有些同胞 不相信你会来带领我们
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.

854
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,370
但是我一直都相信预兆
But I always believed in the Omen.

855
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,110
预兆，请你再提醒我一次
The Omen! Right. Remind me again?

856
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,440
多年前的神明指示
Sent down by the gods years ago...

857
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,440
不，又是你
Oh, no! Not you!

858
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,470
我是小可爱，我爱你
I'm so cuddly! I like you!

859
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,810
伟大的神兽
Oh, Great Him,

860
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,010
你必须带领我们从猎物变成
you must lead us in our transformation from prey...

861
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,380
…掠食动物
...to predator.

862
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,480
慢着，我是伟大的神兽？
Hold it. I am the Great Him?

863
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,130
伟大的神兽？  神兽？
The Great Him?  Him.

864
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,990
这都是你的错 没错，都是你啦
So this is all your fault! That's it! You...!

865
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,090
蛮牛！ 蛮牛，别听他的
Kazar!  Kazar! Don't listen to him!

866
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,600
蛮牛，听我说  蛮牛，这里
Kazar! Over here!  Kazar! Over here!

867
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,840
你胆敢打断我拜见神兽
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!

868
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,280
可是…我们找到一只小狮子
But... but we found a lion cub!

869
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,610
真的假的？  他旁边有一只大狮子吗？
You did?  Was he with a big lion?

870
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,150
有长长的鬃毛？ 其实只是后面很长啦
With big hair? Well, a mullet, really.

871
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,710
伟大的神兽 你带来两头狮子？
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?

872
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,050
我就像其它神兽一样
Well, like any Great Him,

873
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,560
出门旅行都会带保镳
I travel with an entourage.

874
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:57,060
放心，伟大的神兽 我会叫布雷把狮子带来
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.

875
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:01,690
这次他最好别搞砸 别像刚刚那样搞砸我的编舞
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!

876
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,900
我只落后了一小音节
I lost count for one verse.

877
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,340
向前踢，向侧踢、向前走
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.

878
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,970
我们干吗那么辛苦练舞？
Why do we even bother rehearsing?

879
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,670
好的舞群真的很难找耶
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.

880
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,820
快飞上天呀
Take to the skies!

881
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,820
我们这就飞了
We're taking! We're taking!

882
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,550
快去找到他们  遵命，老大
Find them!  Yes, sir.

883
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:28,360
把狮子给我带来
Bring us those lions!

884
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:36,200
众神在庆祝预言终于实现
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.

885
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,860
我们一起用力踏步
We stamp our hooves

886
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,770
赞颂伟大的神兽
in praise of the Great Him!

887
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,670
我的妈啊
Holy moly!

888
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,940
我的妈啊  我的妈啊
Holy moly Holy moly

889
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:49,210
你是万兽之王
You are our king!

890
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,430
你看，那是谁？
Looky, looky who's there.

891
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,770
惊喜！
Surprise!

892
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,740
不！
No!

893
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,750
抱歉我们来晚了
Sorry we're late for dinner!

894
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,150
逊毙了
That's pathetic!

895
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,790
滚开
Get off!

896
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,830
一点都不痛  住手
That didn't hurt!  Stop!

897
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,330
雷恩！  不！
Ryan!  No!

898
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,400
我来了，儿子
I'm coming, son!

899
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,730
爸？
Dad?

900
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,670
救命啊  咱们快闪吧
Help!  Let's scram!

901
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,640
雷恩！  你怎么会在这里？
Ryan!  What are you doing here?

902
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,340
我不敢相信，我找到你了  你是怎么找到我的？
I can't believe it! I found you.  How'd you find me?

903
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,440
你没事吧？有没有受伤？
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

904
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,450
你的脚掌  我被困在绿色箱子
Your paw.  I got trapped in that box.

905
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,850
没事了，儿子
It's OK, son.

906
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,550
后来我逃出来，逃进丛林
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle...

907
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,320
然后这些兀鹰飞来想杀死我
...then those vultures came and tried to kill me.

908
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,020
你一定不怕他们 不过我好怕哦
You wouldn't have been scared. I was.

909
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,460
我有件事要告诉你  什么事？
I have to tell you something.  What?

910
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,500
你听
Listen.

911
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,590
爸，去搞定他们  快跑啊！
Get 'em, Dad!  Run!

912
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,860
快跑！
Run!

913
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,030
爸，你应该追他们
Dad, you should be chasing them!

914
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,510
就像你以前一样  那些只是我说的故事
Like you used to!  Those were just stories!

915
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,910
现在你有机会证明那是真的
But now's your chance to show me for real!

916
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,450
这边
This way!

917
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:38,420
爸，怎么回事？  先爬到树上再说
Dad? What's goin' on?  Just get up into that tree!

918
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:47,090
我们甩掉他们了  怎么回事？
I think we lost them.  What's the deal?

919
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,190
他们只是一群逊脚
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!

920
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,900
你大可以把他们打得落花流水
You could kick their rumps!

921
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,530
雷恩，我打不过他们  胆小鬼，给我回来
Ryan, I can't fight them.  You donkey-chickens! Get back here!

922
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,700
雷恩，我打不过他们
Ryan! I can't fight them.

923
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,370
什么意思？
What do you mean?

924
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,540
我小时候
I was young...

925
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,740
还只是只小狮子
...still just a cub.

926
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,950
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen.

927
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,180
可爱的小朋友
Children of all ages.

928
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,590
山大王 别害怕，抬头挺胸
Samson! Swallow that fear and stand tall!

929
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,600
目睹这只小狮子 一生中最重要的一天
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!

930
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,570
他张嘴大吼的一天
The day he discovers his roar!

931
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,330
爸，我办不到
Dad, I can't do it!

932
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,900
快去吧
Now, go!

933
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:29,880
听小山大王发出 震耳欲聋的吼声
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty,

934
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,400
把一头牛羚震出大草原
it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!

935
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,390
小山大王，鼓起勇气
Samson! Dig deep!

936
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,120
我早就知道
I should have known.

937
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,260
如果你生在大草原 就会知道怎么发出吼声
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.

938
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,660
爸？
Dad?

939
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:03,400
爸！爸！
Dad! Dad!

940
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,410
求求你
Please!

941
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,680
爸
Dad.

942
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,810
当他们把我送到动物园 我不想让任何人知道
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know

943
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,120
…我来自哪里 尤其是我最亲近的朋友
where I came from. Especially those closest to me.

944
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,280
我应该早一点告诉你
I should have told you sooner.

945
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,800
可是…你说的那些故事？
But... all those stories you tell?

946
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,760
对不起，雷恩
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

947
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,860
你跟我说的一切都是谎言？
Everything you told me was a lie?

948
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,410
爸！  抓紧了，儿子
Dad!  Hang on, son.

949
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,310
救命啊！
Help!

950
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,340
雷恩！
Ryan!

951
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,110
雷恩！快跑！
Ryan! Run!

952
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,510
想都别想，小鬼
Not so fast, Tigger.

953
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,920
爸！
Dad!

954
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,760
雷恩！
Ryan!

955
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,260
爸！
Dad!

956
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,600
救命啊！  雷恩
Help!  Ryan.

957
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,660
救救我！爸！
Help! Dad!

958
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,800
雷恩  爸，快来救我！
Ryan.  Dad! Help me!

959
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,750
什么？
What?

960
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,040
等等，什么？等等，什么？
Wait! What? What? Wait!

961
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,390
等等…等等…
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Hey!

962
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:27,920
放开我
Get off me!

963
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,060
这是怎么回事？
What is goin' on here?

964
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:34,160
米田共不会说话 只会像球一样乱滚
Stinky does not speak.  It rolls like a little ball.

965
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,030
慢着，你们以为我是…
Wait. You guys think I'm a...?

966
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,130
闭嘴，米田共  别说话，快滚吧
Achtung, Stinky!  Less talk, more roll.

967
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:41,170
好  翻滚吧
Ja.  Roll! Roll!

968
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,340
搞什么？
What the...? Hey!

969
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,070
滚米田共能让屁股结实
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!

970
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,210
我就让你们滚蛋吧
I'll give you something to roll about!

971
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,150
幸好BJ没看到这一幕
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!

972
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,210
BJ？赖瑞？ 他们都不见了
Bridget? Larry! They're gone.

973
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,520
我得找到他们
I gotta find them!

974
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,190
不，我得先找到山大王
No! I gotta find Samson first!

975
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,730
不，先找到…
No! First...

976
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,090
山大王，山大王！
Sam. Sam!

977
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,410
BJ！赖瑞！
Bridget! Larry!

978
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,250
雷恩，你还活着
Oh, Ryan! You're alive!

979
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,310
真高兴见到你们
Good to see you guys.

980
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,860
给我抱抱  赖瑞
Where's my hug?  Larry.

981
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,690
来吧  我也很高兴见到你
There it is.  It's good to see you too.

982
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,120
你们跑来这儿干吗？
What are you guys doing here?

983
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,460
我们跟你爸一起来找你
We came here with your father to find you.

984
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:43,030
他大概正在外头找我们
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.

985
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,000
我也希望是这样
I wish he were.

986
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,840
不过牛羚把他撞下悬崖
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.

987
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,470
什么？  什么？
What?  What?

988
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,950
我想他活不成了 他没救了
I don't think he made it. I don't see how he could.

989
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,910
噢，雷恩
Oh, Ryan.

990
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,250
很抱歉害你们落到这个下场
I'm sorry I got you into this.

991
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,050
蛮牛，你一定会很喜欢 我们带给你的东西
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.

992
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,590
这是什么？ 另一头狮子呢？
What's this? Where's the other lion?

993
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,360
对，我正要告诉你 那里有一座悬崖
Right. Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...

994
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,700
你干吗用这种眼神看我？
Why are you looking at me like that?

995
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:16,500
这是你今天第二次凸槌了 布雷
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!

996
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,830
你这大笨蛋
You klutz.

997
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,570
你明明知道 如果不吃掉狮子
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain

998
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,700
就升不上食物链顶端
until we eat a lion!

999
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,340
不过至少我可以
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.

1000
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,940
那我们怎么办？
What about the rest of us?

1001
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,850
向前踢、向侧踢
Step-kick, pivot-kick!

1002
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,490
好痛哦，我扭伤了脚
Ouch! I twisted a hoof!

1003
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,720
你为他们辛苦为他们忙 他们却伤透了你的心
You work and you work. Then they break your heart.

1004
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,130
我的演艺事业完了  准备祭品
There goes my career!  Prepare the sacrifices!

1005
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,640
我为什么让他自己去呢？
Why did I let him go off by himself?

1006
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,800
他连蚊子都抓不到 更别说是午餐了
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.

1007
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,010
不过我抓得到你
Bet I could catch you.

1008
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,410
拜托
Please.

1009
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,610
我的天敌是汽车…什么？
My natural predator is fuel inject... What?

1010
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,950
我就知道你没有死 我就知道
I knew you weren't really gone. I knew it!

1011
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,360
我早就料到了 咱们还是麻吉，对吧？
Come on, I knew it! We're still buddies, right?

1012
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,290
我失去了雷恩
I lost Ryan.

1013
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,660
太多敌人了 他被他们抓走了
There were too many. They just took him.

1014
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,390
谁？谁把他抓走？
Who? Who took him?

1015
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:25,030
牛羚  那些有蹄的怪胎
Wildebeests.  The freaks with the hooves!

1016
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,970
他们也把赖瑞和BJ抓走
They got Larry and Bridget too.

1017
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,310
我打不过他们…
Couldn't fight, couldn't...

1018
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,970
加油，山大王，你是狮子耶
Come on, Sam. You're a lion.

1019
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,170
你是万兽之王的后代
You come from a long line of kings.

1020
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,510
没错 也许你不是来自大草原
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.

1021
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,570
但是你拥有神鬼战士的血统
But fighting's in your blood!

1022
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:42,090
不，我永远不会是真正的狮子
No. I'll never be a real lion.

1023
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,060
错了，你是一头真正的狮子
Wrong! You are a real lion.

1024
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,030
不管你来自哪里
Doesn't matter where you're from:

1025
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,930
动物园、丛林、金鱼缸
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.

1026
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,930
内心的勇气才重要
It's what's in here.

1027
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,300
你的心决定你是谁
That determines who you are!

1028
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:56,860
至少你都是这么跟你儿子说的
At least, that's what you always told your son.

1029
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,430
现在他被抓住了
Now he's out there, Sammy,

1030
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,530
而且他需要你
and he needs you.

1031
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,130
还有谁能教他怎么吼？
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?

1032
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:10,950
这就对了，山大王
That's it, Sammy.

1033
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,590
很好
That's it.

1034
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,890
我们去找我儿子和我的朋友
Let's go find my son... and my friends.

1035
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,560
好耶，什么都阻止不了我们
Yeah! Nothing's gonna stop us!

1036
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,040
只是我们根本不知道 我们要去哪里
Except that we have no idea where we're going!

1037
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,800
跟随你的直觉
Follow your instincts.

1038
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,540
跟随你的直觉
Follow your instincts.

1039
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:41,880
那是什么？  我的…直觉
What is that?  My... instincts?

1040
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,450
斑尼？  就快到了
Benny?  You're almost there.

1041
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,120
我终于搞懂了
That settles it, then.

1042
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,850
我妈怀我的时候 一定是喝了太多泳池的水
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.

1043
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,450
斑尼，你看
Benny, look.

1044
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:58,900
有蹄的怪胎
The freaks with hooves!

1045
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,300
雷恩在那里面
Ryan's in there.

1046
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,730
你不能直接闯进去 那等于是自杀
You can't just barge in. That's suicide!

1047
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,330
斑尼，让开  别听那个鼠辈的话
Benny, get out of my way!  Don't listen to the rat.

1048
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:10,400
喂，你骂谁鼠辈？  当然是你罗
Hey, who are you calling a rat?  You, of course.

1049
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,940
你会曝露我们的位置  小心我告你哦
You'll give away our position.  I'll have you written up for that!

1050
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,210
猪头，你搞砸了我们的伪装 弟兄们！分散！
Fool! You blew our cover! Men! Scatter!

1051
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,410
别跑得那么快
Not so fast!

1052
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,920
你看我抓到谁，山大老 这是你的狮子本能
Look who I got, Sammy. It's your lion instincts.

1053
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,360
你们是谁？
Who are you guys?

1054
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,120
我们是谁不重要  我是斗篷，他是迷彩
Our names aren't important.  I'm Cloak. He's Camo.

1055
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,360
我们是卧底探员  你们为什么一直误导我？
We're covert agents.  Why have you been leading me around?

1056
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,800
这是机密情报  最高机密
That's classified.  Top-secret.

1057
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,960
那些牛羚发疯了  斗篷
The wildebeests have gone mad.  Cloak.

1058
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,470
我又没告诉他们 我们打算利用他们打败蛮牛…
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...

1059
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,370
听好，告诉我 他们把我儿子抓去了吗？
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?

1060
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,240
我不能说 你 一定要说
That's need-to-know.  They did.

1061
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,540
他们以为那只无尾熊是神兽  你是史上最逊的卧底探员
They think the koala's a god.  You're the worst covert agent!

1062
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,050
是吗？ 那我怎么会这一招？弟兄们！
Oh, yeah? Then why can I do this? Men!

1063
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,880
不，住手，山大王！
Hey! No! Stop! Sammy!

1064
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,250
猪头，这一招是机密耶  这是秘密，这才是最高机密
Idiot! That maneuver's confidential.  It's secret. This one's confidential.

1065
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,260
迷彩  这是机密情报
Cloak!  And this one's restricted.

1066
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:03,130
超级机密情报 最高机密，超级超级机密
Super-secret. Top-secret. This is ultra-secret!

1067
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,690
够了，别说了
Enough! No more!

1068
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:08,390
让他们见识超级最高机密 「够了」的招式，没问题！
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!

1069
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,490
不！
No!

1070
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,670
我有个点子
I got an idea.

1071
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,580
神兽到底是谁呀？ 我来对付他
Who is this Great Him, anyway? I'll take him on.

1072
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,050
我是女神兽 要让他尝尝我的厉害
I'm the Great Her! I'll show Him a thing or two.

1073
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,550
我是天不怕地不怕的纽约客耶
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.

1074
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,140
天啊
Oh, my.

1075
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,630
这一定是在开玩笑
You have got to be kidding me.

1076
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,510
尼啾，我不知道你在搞什么鬼
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,

1077
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,640
不过我要海扁你…  住嘴
but I will kick your...  Silence!

1078
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,640
你这小王八…
Why, you little...

1079
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,420
我叫你住嘴
Silence, again!

1080
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,890
你不能跟我说话
You do not speak to me!

1081
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,390
尼啾，这是怎么回事？
Nigel, what's the deal?

1082
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,400
伟大的神兽 可以准备举行晚宴了吗？
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?

1083
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,990
可以，我们要吃什么？
Yes, we shall! What's on the menu?

1084
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,470
他们
Them.

1085
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,130
噢，不
Oh, no.

1086
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,870
吃朋友就能当神兽 不吃朋友的话…
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...

1087
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,270
神兽、朋友，神兽、朋友…
God, friends, god, friends. God, I...

1088
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,940
真是令人左右为难
Well, that was subtle.

1089
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,170
准备升火烤肉
Prepare the meat fire!

1090
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,410
等等
Wait!

1091
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,620
烤肉不能没有
We cannot cook them without...

1092
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,150
…洋葱
...onion!

1093
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,680
洋葱…洋葱…
Onions. Onions. Onions.

1094
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,800
哇塞，好快哦
Well, that was fast.

1095
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,990
开始举行仪式
Let the ritual begin.

1096
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,440
走吧
Move it!

1097
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,810
我对你超不爽的
I am so mad at you!

1098
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,180
等等，我们也需要…帽子
Wait! We also need... hats!

1099
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,280
我们没有死刑的派对帽吗？
Do we not have the party hats of death?

1100
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,910
我有呀
I've got mine!

1101
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:11,650
而且宴会开始之前 我们都要…
And before the feast, we must all...

1102
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,650
搞什么？
What the...?

1103
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,760
飘浮
...levitate...

1104
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,690
发疯似的旋转
...and spin uncontrollably!

1105
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,360
觉得有点想吐
And feel a bit sick.

1106
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,600
这玩意要怎么停下来呀？
How do I stop this thing?

1107
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,400
大伙儿  斑尼？
Guys.  Benny?

1108
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,500
看，一只松鼠  赖瑞
Look, a squirrel!  Larry!

1109
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,340
我们有个计划，跟我来
We've got a plan. Follow me.

1110
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:32,000
我们？  我会飞
We?  I can fly!

1111
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,540
伟大的神兽 我们臣服在你的威力之下
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.

1112
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:39,480
臣服吧 只有神兽才会这一招
Be humbled. Only the Great Him can do this!

1113
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,080
火山热气  我们的伪装被识破了
Volcanic gas!  Our cover's blown!

1114
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,650
严重故障，弃船！
Major malfunction! Abandon ship!

1115
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,640
天啊  你也该赶来了
Oh, boy.  Well, about time you got here.

1116
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:01,370
伟大的神兽 这又是另一个奇迹
Great Him, it's another miracle!

1117
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,640
你把真正的狮子带来
You've delivered us a real lion!

1118
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,840
布雷，你出运了
Blag, your luck has turned.

1119
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:11,250
多亏伟大神兽的帮忙 我们都会升级到食物链顶端
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.

1120
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,310
尼啾，我们得声东击西
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.

1121
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,520
等一下
Hang on a sec!

1122
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,250
我袖里乾坤，藏了一大堆奇迹
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!

1123
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,490
预备，退后
Ready? Stand back...

1124
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,160
伟大的神兽要对付
...as the Great Me attacks the lion

1125
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,760
比我大73倍的狮子
over 73 times my size!

1126
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,670
爸？我爸还活着！ 大伙儿，我爸没有死
Dad? My dad's alive! Guys, my dad made it!

1127
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,540
雷恩，不！  快点，我要去找他
Ryan, no!  Hurry, I got to see him!

1128
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,950
打呀，打呀
Whack, whack, whack!

1129
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,420
爸！  什么？雷恩！
Dad!  What? Ryan!

1130
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,780
这是我的伎俩  雷恩，不！
I planned this.  Ryan, no!

1131
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:57,860
宇宙秩序终于逆转了
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.

1132
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:00,730
跟紧我 猎物变成掠食动物
Stay close.  Prey has become predator!

1133
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,700
掠食动物变成猎物
And predator has become prey!

1134
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,400
草食动物终于打败肉食动物
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!

1135
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,300
爸，来吧 让我们教训这些牛肉干
Come on, Dad! Let's show these turkey-jerkies

1136
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,500
让他们知道谁才是老大
who's at the top of the food chain!

1137
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,780
先把小狮子吃掉
Let's eat the brat first.

1138
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,110
想都别想
Over my dead body!

1139
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,560
好耶
Yeah.

1140
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,690
爸！
Dad!

1141
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,800
我们不想办法 他就会把山大王杀死
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!

1142
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,570
咱们何不使用秘密绝招？
Why don't we use the secret play?

1143
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,410
我知道 赖瑞，闭嘴，那太蠢了
I know. Shut up, Larry. That's stupid.

1144
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,810
不，那太聪明了
No! It's brilliant!

1145
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:54,650
当我提到预兆他们就笑我
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.

1146
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,350
看看现在谁还敢笑
But look who's laughing now!

1147
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,760
左边一点，好 不对，右边一点
Little to the left. Yeah. No! Little to the right!

1148
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,600
下一层 食物链最底端
Next floor: Bottom of the food chain!

1149
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,240
叮！
Ding!

1150
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:13,300
发射！
Fire!

1151
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,240
我得找更大的武器
We gotta find something bigger!

1152
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,780
我知道哪里有更大的武器
I know where we can find something bigger.

1153
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,820
预备，雷恩  拉紧一点
Ready, Ryan?  Dig deep!

1154
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,520
你应该待在家里
You should have stayed at home.

1155
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,860
咱们的祭坛会是你的坟墓
Now our shrine will become your tomb.

1156
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,300
发射
Fire!

1157
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:47,540
雷恩！
Ryan!

1158
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:49,900
雷恩！
Ryan!

1159
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,970
通常在上主菜之前
I don't typically eat dessert

1160
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,170
我不会先吃甜点
before the main course!

1161
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,280
离我儿子远一点
Get away from my son!

1162
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:09,890
雷恩
Ryan.

1163
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,700
雷恩，你没事吧？
Ryan, are you still with me?

1164
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:23,970
我没事，我只想告诉你
It's OK, Dad. I just want you to know

1165
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,610
很遗憾你不像我 有一个好父亲
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.

1166
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,340
雷恩
Ryan.

1167
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,850
好感人哦
How touching.

1168
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,750
不过临终遗言通常都很感人
But then, last words usually are.

1169
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,150
解决他们
Finish them.

1170
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,590
你们在干吗？
What are you doing?

1171
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:55,470
我命令你们攻击他们 就像真正的掠食动物那样
I command you to attack them, like true predators!

1172
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:58,880
我们不是掠食动物 不想再假装下去
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.

1173
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:03,080
更重要的是，我们受够你了
But most of all, we're tired of you.

1174

布雷，好吧
Blag. Fine.

1175

爸，记得你在故事里 总是告诉我
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:

1177

鼓起勇气
Dig deep.

1178
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:43,020
好耶，宝贝

1181
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:11,210
来吧，我们离开这鬼地方  快走吧
Come on, let's get out of here!  Get out of here!

1182
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,980
我要在大家面前说 我一直都讨厌你编的舞
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.

1183
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,890
真的很…俗耶
It's so... '80s.

1184
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:21,290
没错，跑吧
That's right! Run!

1185
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,890
就像胆小的猎物逃跑吧
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!

1186
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,950
我会猎杀你们
I will hunt you down!

大伙儿，快到船上

Larry, throw it in reverse!  Reverse throwing!

1195
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,970
至少我在大草原消失前 目睹这一切
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.

1196
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,540
我还是看得到它，它就在…
I can still see it. It's right...

1197
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,550
我的心中 我找到我的吼声
Here. I found my roar.

1198
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,610
我们都找到了，儿子
We both did, son.

1199
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,690
爸，这是我们第一个 「山大王和雷恩」的故事
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.

1200
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,030
我想不会有人相信吧
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.

1201
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,940
炸弹来袭
