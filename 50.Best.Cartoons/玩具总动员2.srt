00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,253
我去不成牛仔营 都是因为一顶蠢帽子
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy camp, all because of my stupid hat!

52
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,728
胡迪，看看你的靴底 别傻了
- Woody, look under your boot. - Don't be silly.

53
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:29,823
帽子不在那儿 你看看嘛
- My hat is not under my boot. - Would you just look?

54
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,802
瞧，没有帽子 只有「安弟』这两个字
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

55
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,634
不管你有没有帽子
And the boy who wrote that

56
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:38,698
他还是会带你去牛仔营
would take you to camp with or without your hat.

57
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,745
对不起，宝贝
I'm sorry, Bo.

58
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,576
只是我等了一整年
It's just that I've been lookin' forward to this all year.

You're cute when you care.

61
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:53,348
别在巴斯面前这样嘛 管他的，他爱看就看

- Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear! - Which one is off?

68
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:15,578
价钱低得咕咕叫
<i>Buck-buck-buck! And that's</i> <i>cheap-cheap-cheap! So hurry on down...</i>

I forgot. You're broken.

128
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:23,425
我不要跟你玩了

永别了，胡迪
Bye, Woody.

133
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,453
安弟，别走!
No! No! Andy!

134
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:10,137
吱吱，是你吗？
Wheezy, is that you?

135
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,766
嗨，胡迪 你怎么会在这儿？
- Hey, Woody. - What are you doing up here?

136
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:16,005
我以为妈咪 老早就把你修好了
I thought Mom took you to get your squeaker fix. Ed months ago.

137
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,205
安弟很着急耶 没有
- Andy was so upset. - Nah.

138
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,545
她只是安慰安弟而已
She just told him that to calm him down

139
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,607
然后就把我放上来
and then put me on the shelf.

140
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:26,143
你怎么不求救呢？ 我试着吱吱叫
- Why didn't you yell for help? - Well, I tried squeakin'.

141
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:28,986
可是没有用，没有人听得到
But I'm still broken. No one could hear me.

142

况且灰尘让我病得更重
Besides, the dust aggravates my condition.

143
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,804
反正我是无药可救了
What's the point in prolonging the inevitable?

144
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:47,036
我们最后都会沦落到那儿的
We're all just one stitch away from here to there.

00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,825
那是翠丝，唱歌女牛仔
<i>There's Jessie</i> <i>the yodeling cowgirl</i>

297
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,902
瞧，那是我
Look it! That's me!

298
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:55,704
红心，胡迪的好马儿 他真聪明
- <i>Bullseye he's Woody's horse</i> - <i>He's a smart one</i>

299
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:59,906
邋遢矿工彼得 我的丁字m呢？
- <i>Pete the old Prospector</i> - <i>Has anyone seen my pick?</i>

300
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:03,415
当然还有男主角他本人
<i>And the man himself</i> <i>Of course it's time for Sheriff Woody</i>

301
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,917
胡迪警长他最行
<i>He's the very best</i>

302
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,454
他是西部
<i>He's the rootin'-est</i> <i>tootin'-est cowboy</i>

303
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:10,319
最棒最酷最炫的警长
<i>In the wild wild west</i>

304
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:14,020
胡迪牛仔秀
Woody's Roundup

305
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:14,161
(选台音量)

306
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,152
(选台音量)

307
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,290
我找不到 每一台都找不到
I can't find it! It doesn't seem to be on any of these stations.

308
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,198
继续找 你转得太慢了
- Keep looking. - You're going too slow.

309
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,758
让我来
Let me take the wheel.

310
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,395
太快了
It's too fast.

311
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:27,373
你怎么看得到？ 我看得到
- How can you even tell what's on? - I can tell.

312
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,833
转回去 回去
Stop! Back, back, back!

313
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:34,369
太晚了，转过头了 我要从头开始
Too late. I'm in the 40s. Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.

314
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:37,349
对了 找到大公鸡就没错
- Back, back! Stop! - <i>And look for the giant chicken!</i>

315
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:40,046
画板，快画吧
Now, Etch!

316
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,656
我一定要去这里
That's where I need to go.

317
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:45,749
不行，巴斯，你办不到的
You can't go, Buzz. You'll never make it there.

318
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,090
上次胡迪冒险救我
Woody once risked his life to save me.

319
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:52,258
这次我不去救他 就不配当他的朋友
I couldn't call myself his friend if I weren't willing to do the same.

320
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,267
谁要跟来？
So who's with me?

321
00:24:54,335 --> 00:25:00,001
我替你多装一双鞋 还有愤怒的双眼，以防万一
I'm packing you an <i>extra</i> pair of shoes and your angry eyes just in case.

322
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,910
我要你找到胡迪 替我亲他一下
This is for Woody when you find him.

323
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:09,242
好吧，可是我亲他
All right,

324
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:11,614
跟你亲他的意义很不同
but I don't think it'll mean the same coming from me.

325
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:16,521
巴斯光年先生 你一定要把胡迪救出来
Mr. Buzz Lightyear, you just gotta save my pal Woody.

326
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,555
我会尽力而为，吱吱
I'll do my best, son.

327
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,923
好了，大伙儿，出发吧
OK, fellas. Let's roll.

328
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,635
我跳了
Geronimo!

329
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:34,263
我有这么多打电玩的经验
You'd think with all my video game ex. Perience,

330
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,673
所以应该是难不倒我
I'd be feeling more prepared.

331
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:41,811
重点是…你得放手
The idea is to let go.

332
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:44,510
我们会赶在安弟之前回来
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

333
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,850
别随便跟陌生玩具说话
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

334
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,323
飞向艾而玩具城
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

335
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:04,933
老矿工
<i>They don't call this</i>

336
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,734
这座废弃矿坑真是可怕
<i>the old abandoned mine</i> <i>for nothin' Prospector.</i>

337
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:08,798
我们最好赶紧出去
<i>I reckon we oughta</i> <i>get outta here.</i>

338
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:12,175
我的黄金呢？ 等等，我来点蜡烛
<i>Where's my gold?</i> <i>Hold on. I'll light me a candle.</i>

339
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:14,339
这根蜡烛烧得好快
<i>This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.</i>

340
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:17,748
这是炸药，我们完蛋了
<i>Blast us to smithereens!</i> <i>That there's dynamite!</i>

341
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:19,877
我的妈呀 让我来求救
- <i>Holy tarnation!</i> - <i>I'll call for help.</i>

342
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:26,483
小动物，去找胡迪警长 快去
<i>Hey critters go get Sheriff Woody.</i> <i>Now scurry!</i>

343
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,289
真好，红心
<i>Good job Bullseye.</i>

344
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:30,956
新的学校终于盖好了
<i>I reckon the new schoolhouse</i> <i>is finally done.</i>

345
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,625
什么？
<i>What's that?</i>

346
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,100
翠丝和老矿工 被困在废弃矿坑
<i>Jessie and Prospector are trapped</i> <i>in the old abandoned mine</i>

347
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:37,330
老矿工误触炸药
<i>and Prospectorjust lit a stick</i> <i>of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle</i>

348
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:39,338
他们就快要被炸成碎片？
<i>and now they're about</i> <i>to be blown to smithereens?</i>

349
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,239
红心，快马加鞭吧
<i>Ride like the wind Bullseye!</i>

350
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:50,781
别煽风点火，翠丝 你得用头脑才能熄灭炸药
<i>You're fannin' the flames Jessie!</i> <i>It takes brains to put out that fire.</i>

351
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,945
我的屁股着火了
<i>My biscuits are burnin'!</i>

352
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,651
(大峡谷)

353
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:00,659
胡迪跟红心能跃过大峡谷吗？
<i>Will Woody and Bullseye</i> <i>land to safety?</i>

354
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:03,253
他们能及时救出 翠丝跟老矿工彼得吗？
<i>Can they reach Jessie</i> <i>and Stinky Pete in time?</i>

355
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,130
下周同一时间记得收看 「胡迪冒险记』大结局
<i>Tune in net week for the eciting</i> <i>conclusion: "Woody's Finest Hour."</i>

356
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,136
棒呆了，下一集
All right! All right! <i>Next</i> tape!

357
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:13,065
等等，接下来怎么样？
Hey, wait. What happened? What happens <i>next?</i>

358
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,506
我要看大结局 没有了
- Come on! Let's see the <i>next</i> episode! - That's it.

359
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:16,565
什么？
What?

360
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,909
后来节目被迫停播
The show was canceled after that.

361
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,073
慢着，那座废弃矿坑
Wait, wait, wait. What about the gold mine

362
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,674
可爱的小动物跟炸药呢？
and the cute little critters and the dynamite?

363
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,516
这么精采的节目 怎么会被停播呢？
That was a great show! I mean, why cancel it?

364
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:30,022
三个字：太空人
Two words: Sput-nik.

365
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,027
太空人一登陆月球 小孩子只想玩太空玩具
Once the astronauts went up, children only wanted to play with space toys.

366
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:38,690
我知道那种感觉 我有自己的节目耶
I know how that feels. But still, my own show.

367
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,132
你们看看这些玩意 你不知道吗？
- I mean, look at all this stuff! - Didn't you know?

368
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,103
你是热门的抢手货耶
Why, you're valuable property!

369
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:47,106
真希望我的朋友们能来分享 哇赛，是我耶
I wish the guys could see this. Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

370
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,266
我有溜溜球
I'm on a yo-yo.

371
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:49,707
(胡迪牛仔秀)

372
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:54,407
洁白的牙齿 帅气依然不减
Nice teeth. And yet, still a good-lookin' guy.

373
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:56,572
(孤儿)

374
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,142
这是存钱筒，酷毙了
It's a bank! Cool.

375
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,156
这是什么？只要按一下
What do you do? You push the hat, and out co...

376
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,887
就会吹泡泡，真高明
Out come bubbles. Clever.

377
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,759
这玩意是做什么的？
Wow. What's this thing do?

378
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:12,560
我懂了
I get it.

379
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,794
我的靴子里有蛇
"There's a snake in my boot."

380
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:19,498
红心，向前跑
Hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

381
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:22,942
一台老唱机
A record player!

382
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,242
我好久没看到这个了
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

383
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,908
好了，现在慢一点
OK, now. Slow.

384
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,918
好好笑哦，红心
That's funny, Bullseye.

385
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,512
上来吧，女牛仔 快一点
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

386
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:41,153
不错嘛 胡迪牛仔秀，大家一起玩
- Not bad. - <i>It's time for</i> Woody's Roundup

387
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:43,628

00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,825
最棒最酷最炫的警长
<i>He's the rootin'-est</i> <i>tootin'-est cowboy...</i>

389
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:50,530
你看，我们凑成一整组了
Look at us! We're a complete set!

390
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,266
现在可以去博物馆了 博物馆？
- Now it's on to the museum. - Museum?

391
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:57,967
什么博物馆？ 独一无二的博物馆
- What museum? - The museum.

392
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:02,072
我们被卖到东京的 小西玩具博物馆
We're being sold to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

393
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:04,344
在日本耶 日本？
- That's in japan! - Japan?

394
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:07,012
不行，我不能去日本
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to japan.

395
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,455
什么意思？
What do you mean?

396
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,650
我得回去找我的主人安弟
I've got to get back home to my owner, Andy.

397
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,192
你们看
Hey, look, look. See?

398
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,354
他还有主人 我的老天
- He still has an owner. - My goodness.

399
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:19,625
我…不要
No. Can't go.

400
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,669
我不要回去储藏室
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

401
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:24,795
翠丝 我不要回到黑暗中
- Jessie. - I won't go back in the dark!

402
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:26,737
她是怎么了？
What's the matter? What's wrong with her?

403
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,367
我们一直被关在储藏室
Well, we've been in storage for a long time

404
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,468
等你来
waiting for you.

405
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,376
为什么？ 一定要有你
- Why me? - The museum's

406
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,541
博物馆才肯收藏我们
only interested in the collection if you're in it, Woody.

407
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:39,916
没有你，我们就得回储藏室
Without you, we go back into storage.

408
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,649
就这么简单 不公平
- It's that simple. - It's not fair!

409
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,452
你怎么可以这样？
How can you do this to us?

410
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:47,517
对不起，这是个错误
Hey, look. I'm sorry, but this is all a big mistake.

411
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:50,654
我在前院拍卖时被… 前院拍卖？
- You see, I was in this yard sale... - Yard sale?

412
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:52,926
如果你有主人 怎么会被拍卖？
Why were you in a yard sale if you have an owner?

413
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,901
我只是去救一个朋友
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there. I was trying to save another toy when...

414
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,633
是因为你坏了吗？ 安弟把你弄坏了吗？
Was it because you're damaged? Did this Andy break you?

415
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:03,609
对，但是…不对! 那只是个意外
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no! It was... It was an accident.

416
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,305
听起来他真是爱惜你
- I mean... - Sounds like he <i>really</i> loves you.

417
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,316
才不是这样 我也不想去博物馆
It's not like that, OK? And I'm not going to any museum!

418
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:12,909
我也不想回储藏室
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

419
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,282
艾而回来了
Al's coming!

420
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,915
翠丝，跳进去
Go! Go on, jessie.

421
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:19,357
翠丝，看着我
Jessie, look at me.

422
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:23,362
我保证你一定出得来 快跳进去吧
I promise you'll come out of the box... Now go! Go!

423
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,105
好戏登场了
It's show time!

424
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,309
钱来也…钱来也…
Money, baby. Money, money, money.

425
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:41,546
现在轮到男主角登场
And now, the main attraction.

426
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,071
不!他的手呢？
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

427
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,980
糟了，不!

428
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,849
我该怎么办？我知道了
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

429
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:05,358
快接…快接电话
Come on! Come on! Come on! Pick up the phone!

430
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:07,256
是我艾而
- <i>Hello?</i> - It's me. It's Al.

431
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,316
我有紧急状况
I got an emergency.

432
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:10,158
我在忙 大家都在忙
- <i>I'm busy.</i> - Yes, we're all busy.

433
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,994
你今晚一定要过来
Look. It has to be tonight.

434
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,694
好吧，明天一大早就来
All right. All right. But first thing in the morning.

435
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:18,363
完了，天啊 我不敢相信
It's gone! I can't believe it!

436
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:21,066
我的手断了 过来让我瞧瞧
- My arm is completely gone! - All right. Come here. Let me see that.

437
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:24,440
只是线断了，很容易补的
It's just a popped seam, easily repaired.

438
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:26,843
算你走运 走运？
- You should consider yourself lucky. - Lucky?

439
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,939
你是老糊涂吗？ 我的手断了耶
Are you shrink-wrapped? I am missing my arm!

440
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:32,178
那又怎样？
Big deal.

441
00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:33,617
(嗨，大家好)

一定很想跟一个 独臂牛仔玩的

翠丝，你知道他这种情况 在外头撑不了一小时
Why, jessie, you know he wouldn't last an hour on the streets in his condition.

445
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:48,594
外面的世界对玩具而言 太危险了
It's a dangerous world out there for a toy.

446
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:13,526
在我赛好之前别偷看
All right. Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

451
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:25,364
我被小薛抓走胡迪有放弃吗？ 没有
Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?

452
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:30,237
没错，你把他踢下卡车 他有放弃吗？
And did he give up when you threw him out of the back of that moving van?

453
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:32,778
你非得提这档事吗？ 他没有放弃
- You had to bring that up. - No, he didn't!

454
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:37,977
有一个朋友需要我们 我们一定要把他安全救回家
We have a friend in need, and we will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

455
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:39,848
继续前进
Now let's move out!

456

Come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad guy.

459
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:42,675
我会害你们被收起来 快走开
You're gonna go back in storage because of me, remember? Just go.

460
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:45,649

但是你不能出声 来吧
But you have got to keep quiet. Come on.

462

好了，把我抬起来
OK, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

464
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:17,947
红心，别乱来
Bullseye. Cut it out.

465
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:20,850
别这样，红心
Stop it. Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

466
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,252
别闹了
Stop it.

警察先生，我发誓我没有…
No, Officer! I swear. What?

469
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,361
进去吧，好了 烂盒子
Get in there. There you go. Cheap case.

470
00:35:11,437 --> 00:35:16,033
电视遥控器呢？ 遥控器呢？
Where is the remote? Where is the remote?

471
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:20,712
我每次都乱放…在这儿
Why don't I put it in the same place every... Here it is.

472
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,253
你太卑鄙了
What is your problem?

473
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,293
很抱歉我帮不了你
Look, I'm sorry I can't help you guys out.

474
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,057
不过你也不必耍这一招
Really, I am. But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt like that.

475
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,690
你说是我干的
What? You think <i>I did that?

476
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,859
是啊，难道电视会自动打开
Right. The TV just <i>happened</i> to turn on,

477
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,267
遥控器会自己 飞到你面前吗？
and the remote <i>magically</i> ended up in front of you!

478
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:48,204
你是说我是骗子吗？ 你是不打自招
- You calling me a liar? - Well, if the boot fits...

479
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,434
再说一次
Say that again.

480
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:53,842
你是不打自招
If the boot fits.

481
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:56,473
好吧，牛仔
OK, cowboy.

482
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:06,052
尝到苦头了吧 把话收回去，收回去
How do you like that? Take it back! Take it back!

483
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:08,683
别以为你是女孩子 我就会饶过你
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl, I'm gonna take it easy on you.

484
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:11,423
翠丝、胡迪，马上住手
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

485

(胡迪牛仔秀系列玩具)

487
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:16,899
我不知道电视怎么会打开
I don't know how that television turned on,

488
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,233
不过打架没有用
but fighting about it isn't helping anything.

489
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:22,570
要是我的双手健全… 你没有双手
- If I had both my arms... - The fact is, you don't, Woody,

490
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,041
所以你最好等到早上
so I suggest you just wait until morning.

491
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,307
工匠会来修补你 然后我就走人
- The cleaner will come, fix. Your arm... - And then I'm outta here!

492
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:34,246
红心，你不要这样
Oh, no, no. Bullseye, don't take it that way.

493
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,379
只是安弟… 安弟…安弟…
- It's just that Andy... - Andy, Andy, Andy.

494
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:39,288
他只关心安弟
That's all he ever talks about.

495
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,692
巴斯，慢一点好吗？
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

496
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:54,637
我要提醒你 我可是身怀巨款耶

- Is everyone present and accounted for? - Not quite everyone.

499

谁落后了？ 我的屁股
- Who's behind? - Mine.

- Thank you. - I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud.

583
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,907
那就把机会让给单身汉
- I'm a married spud. - Then make room for the single fellas.

584
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:26,107
右手边是模型汽车系列 1967年系列有16辆车
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle. Developed in 1967,

585
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,673
包括雪佛兰跑车
the original series had 16 cars, including the Corvette.

586
00:45:28,818 --> 00:45:30,911
对不起，小姐，请问 艾而的办公室在哪儿？
I beg your pardon, ma'am, but where's Al's office?

587
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:34,081
请在导览之后再发问 感谢您
Please hold all questions until the end of the tour. Thank you.

588
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:36,387
上面教你怎么打败札克天王
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!

589
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:39,223
抱抱龙，快拿开
- Ex. Cuse me, sir. - Get this outta here, "geek-osaur."

590
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:42,230
小心! 停车!停车!
- Look out! - Stop, stop, stop!

591
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:50,337
方向盘打直
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

592
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:54,036
我的必胜秘笈
My source of power!

593
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,841
回来!
No! Come back! Hey!

594
00:45:57,948 --> 00:46:01,611
等等我，慢一点
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

595
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:04,950
恐龙在后面，慢一点
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!

596
00:46:05,455 --> 00:46:07,252
请留在座位上
Remain seated, please.

597
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:09,849
“西班牙语”

598
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,825
听我说，你不是太空战警
Listen to me. Listen to me. You're not really a space ranger.

599
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,831
你是个玩具 我们都是玩具
You're a toy. We're all toys. Do you hear me?

600
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,562
你等着受军法审判吧
Well, that should hold you till the court martial.

601
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:23,470
放开我，你搞不懂状况
Let me go! You don't realize what you're doing!

602
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:26,269
这里是巴斯光年区
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

603
00:46:26,343 --> 00:46:31,337
1995那年 巴斯光年玩偶供不应求
In 1995, shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand.

604
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,848
巴斯 停车，你们是谁？
- Hey, Buzz! - Halt! Who goes there?

605
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,545
别闹了，上车吧
<i>Quit clownin' around and get in the car!

606
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,850
巴斯 我知道该怎么击败札克
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!

607
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:42,187
真的吗？ 上车后我再告诉你
- You do? - Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

608
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:47,753
大伙儿，他不是真的巴斯 你们认错人了
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!

609
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:50,129
这么酷的皮带哪来的？
Say, where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz?

610
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,566
猪扑满，这是标准配备
Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue.

611
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:01,936
(西部服饰，牛仔头巾)

612
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:02,671
(和胡迪一起学弹吉他)

613
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:08,583
我就像在印钞票一样
It's like printing my own money.

614
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,650
喂，干嘛？
Yeah? What?

615
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,453
小西先生，是的 照片都在这儿
Mr. Konishi. Yes, I have the pictures right here.

616
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:19,859
我正开车赶去办公室 准备传真给你
In fact, I'm in the car right now on my way to the office to fax. Them to you.

617
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:22,864
我在过隧道，讯号不清楚
I'm going through a tunnel! I'm breakin' up!

618
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:26,629
你们看，我真是焕然一新
Wow! Will you look at me? It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

619
00:47:26,736 --> 00:47:30,934
他缝得好牢 这下安弟一定扯不坏
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

620
00:47:31,007 --> 00:47:33,134
嗨，你好
Hi! Hello!

621
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:35,768
太好了，你可以走了
Great. Now you can go.

622
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,316
真是个好主意
Well, what a good idea.

623
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:52,786
胡迪，别生翠丝的气
Woody, don't be mad at jessie.

624
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:55,092
她受的苦也蚨嗔
She's been through more than you know.

625
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:57,656
你在走之前跟她和好吧
Why not make amends before you leave, huh?

626
00:47:57,734 --> 00:48:00,464
这是你应该做的
It's the least you can do.

627
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:11,771
好吧，不过没什么用
All right. But I don't know what good it'll do.

628
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:20,645
你在上面干嘛？
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

629
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:25,559
我想再看太阳一眼 然后就会永远被关起来
Thought I'd get one last look at the sun before I get packed away again.

630
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,062
我知道你很恨我
Look, jessie. I know you hate me for leaving,

631
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,623
但是我一定要回家
but I have to go back.

632
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,465
我还是安弟的玩具
I'm still Andy's toy.

633
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:37,472
要是你认识安弟 一定会了解…
Well, if you knew him, you'd understand. Andy's a real...

634
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,135
让我猜，他是个特别的小孩
Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid.

635
00:48:41,244 --> 00:48:43,644
你是他最好的朋友
And to him, you're his buddy, his best friend.

636
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:49,310
只要安弟跟你一起玩 虽然你不会动
And when Andy plays with you, it's like even though you're not moving,

637
00:48:49,419 --> 00:48:53,412
你却觉得自己是活的 因为他也认为你是真的
you feel like you're alive, because that's how he sees you.

638
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,685
你怎么知道？
How did you know that?

639
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:59,092
因为爱咪莉也一样
Because Emily was just the same.

640
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,995
她是我的一切
She was my whole world.

641
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:07,760
当我有人爱
<i>When somebody loved me</i>

642
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:11,068
一切都美好
<i>Everything was beautiful</i>

643
00:49:11,174 --> 00:49:14,974
每一分每一秒
<i>Every hour we spent together</i>

644
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:18,036
都活在我心中
<i>Lives within my heart</i>

645
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:22,310
每当她流泪
<i>And when she was sad</i>

646
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:25,946
我为她擦干
<i>I was there to dry her tears</i>

647
00:49:26,022 --> 00:49:31,585
每当她开心，我也很快乐
<i>And when she was happy so was I

648
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:36,564
当她还爱我
<i>When she loved me</i>

649
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:43,102
不管寒冬或酷暑
<i>Through the summer and the fall</i>

650
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:47,337
只要有彼此，我们不寂莫
<i>We had each other</i> <i>That was all</i>

651
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,469
我跟她一起
<i>Just she and I together</i>

652
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:55,041
永远相偎依
<i>Like it was meant to be</i>

653
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:58,451
每当她孤单
<i>And when she was lonely</i>

654
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:02,048
我就陪着她
<i>I was there to comfort her</i>

655
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,561
我也知道
<i>And I knew that</i>

656
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:11,624
她爱我
<i>She loved me</i>

657
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:21,175
一年一年过去
<i>So the years went by</i>

658
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:23,872
我还是一样
<i>I stayed the same</i>

659
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:27,815
她却越走越远
<i>But she began to drift away</i>

660
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:31,945
丢下我一个
<i>I was left alone</i>

661
00:50:32,021 --> 00:50:35,388
但我仍然期待她
<i>Still I waited for the day</i>

662
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,820
说一声
<i>When she'd say</i>

663
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:41,557
我永远…
<i>I will always</i>

664
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:45,192
…都爱你
<i>Love you</i>

665
00:50:46,236 --> 00:50:50,229
于是我痴痴的等
<i>Lonely and forgotten</i>

666
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:53,742
希望她再看一眼
<i>I never thought she'd look my way</i>

667
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:57,438
终于她笑着抱着我
<i>She smiled at me and held me</i>

668
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:01,574
就像美好的从前
<i>Just like she used to do</i>

669
00:51:01,651 --> 00:51:05,246
她是那么地爱我
<i>Like she loved me</i>

670
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:09,189
疼我
<i>When she loved me</i>

671
00:51:10,827 --> 00:51:14,092
当我有人爱
<i>When somebody loved me</i>

672
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:18,998
一切都美好
<i>Everything was beautiful</i>

673
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:23,027
每一分每一秒
<i>Every hour we spent together</i>

674
00:51:23,106 --> 00:51:27,075
都活在我心中
<i>Lives within my heart</i>

675
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:28,235
(爱心捐献)
<i>When she loved me</i>

676
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:33,009
当她还爱我

677
00:51:45,794 --> 00:51:51,357
我们忘不了爱咪莉或安弟
You never forget kids like Emily or Andy.

678
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:55,997
但是他们会忘了我们
But they forget you.

679
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,268
翠丝，我不知道 你走吧
- Jessie, I... I didn't know. - Just go.

680
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:23,158
友情能维持多久？
How long will it last, Woody?

681
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:26,759
你真的以为安弟 会带你一起上大学
Do you really think Andy is gonna take you to college

682
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,530
或是度蜜月吗？
or on his honeymoon?

683
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,731
安弟会长大
Andy's growing up,

684
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:35,834
你无法阻止他
and there's nothing you can do about it.

685
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:39,071
你有两个选择
It's your choice, Woody.

686
00:52:39,147 --> 00:52:43,277
你可以回去 或是跟我们一起永远保存
You can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever.

687
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:48,346
受到世世代代小孩的喜爱
You'll be adored by children for generations.

688
00:53:04,373 --> 00:53:08,036
我算哪根葱，怎么能拆散 「胡迪牛仔秀」？
Who am I to break up the Roundup gang?

689
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:27,493
胡迪，你在吗？ 这也是空盒子
- Hey, Woody, are you in here? - Nah. This one's empty too.

690
00:53:27,562 --> 00:53:30,360
胡迪…
- Woody! Woody! - Woody!

691
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:33,992
打扰了，请问两位 有没有看到断手的牛仔？
Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

692
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:36,366
没有耶 嘿，他在跟我讲话
- Why, no, I haven't. - Hey! He was talkin' to me!

693
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:38,735
他是在跟我讲话 可恶
- No! He was talkin' to me! - Why, you...

694
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:41,630
我们一直以为
You see, all along,

695
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:44,371
入口是札克城堡的大门
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress was through the main gate,

696
00:53:44,445 --> 00:53:49,246
其实秘密入口在左边 藏在阴影底下
but in fact, the secret entrance is to the left, hidden in the shadows.

697
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,580
左边的阴影下，知道了
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

698
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:55,922
有人来了 大家快找掩护
- Someone's coming. - Everyone, take cover.

699
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,458
路上大赛车，就甭提了
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want to bore you with the details.

700
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,790
请问你的传真几号？
Yes. Now, let me confirm your fax. Number.

701
00:54:00,895 --> 00:54:02,157
42…
- <i>011...</i> - 011. Wait.

702
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,891
好多号码哦 知道了
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

703
00:54:03,965 --> 00:54:06,160
是他 公鸡人
- It's him. - The chicken man.

704
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:07,496
奇怪，他一点都不像家禽
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

705
00:54:07,568 --> 00:54:10,332
他就是绑匪没错
That's the kidnapper, all right.

706
00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:13,999
他才不是绑匪 他是札克的爪牙
A kidnapper! An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

707
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:24,916
这就是我的无价之宝
And the piece de resistance!

708
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:27,783
我保证这会是 你最耀眼的收藏品
I promise the collection will be the crown jewel of your museum.

709
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:30,289
那是胡迪 这些货你都看了
- It's Woody! - Now that I have your attention,

710
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:33,555
我要在价钱后面加一个零 什么？
imagine we added another zero to the price, huh?

711
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,255
你要多少钱都行 棒呆了
- <i>I'll pay anything you want.</i> - Yes! Yes!

712
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:41,062
咱们一言为定 我搭下一班机到日本
You got a deal! I'll be on the <i>next</i> flight to japan!

713
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:43,160
快跳进家禽人的货舱
<i>Quick. Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

714
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:46,638
他会带我们找到札克 快…快…
He'll lead us to Zurg. Move, move, move!

715
00:54:47,241 --> 00:54:49,300
莎哟娜啦，再见
Don't touch my moustache!

716
00:54:55,316 --> 00:54:58,376
发了!发了!
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

717
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:58,201
(巴斯光年死敌 札克天王)

718
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:09,315
(看这里)

719
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,723
(札克天王远视镜)

720
00:56:12,793 --> 00:56:15,956
消灭巴斯光年
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

721
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,898
消灭巴斯光年…
Destroy Buzz Lightyear. Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

722
00:56:25,106 --> 00:56:27,438
他没拿走袋子 不能浪费时间
- He didn't take the bag! - No time to lose!

723
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:39,146
他搭乘垂直输送机
He's ascending in the vertical transporter.

724
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,485
抓紧了，我们要冲到屋顶
All right, everyone. Hang on. We're gonna blast through the roof.

725
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:46,617
巴斯 飞向宇宙…浩瀚无垠
- Buzz? - To infinity and beyond!

726
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:53,024
你秀逗啦？别浪费时间 站好了，抱抱龙
What are you? Insane? We're wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

727
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:56,129
我搞不懂
I don't understand.

728
00:56:56,203 --> 00:56:58,933
我的电瓶怎么会没有电
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

729
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,517
糟了，他到了23楼
Blast. He's on level 23.

730
00:57:18,592 --> 00:57:20,924
我们该怎么上去？
How are we gonna get up there?

731
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:23,429
我们可以找几个气球漂上去
Maybe if we find some balloons, we could float to the top.

732
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:26,193
别开玩笑了 我们叠罗汉
Are you kidding? I say we stack ourselves up,

733
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,735
再按对讲机 假扮我们在送比萨
push the intercom and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

734
00:57:28,803 --> 00:57:32,102
火腿三明治薯条加热狗 怎么样？
How about a ham sandwich... with fries and a hot dog?

735
00:57:32,173 --> 00:57:33,162
那我呢？
What about me?

736
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,969
你是随餐附赠玩具
You can be the toy that comes with the meal.

737
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,909
弟兄们，这儿
Troops! Over here.

738
00:57:41,515 --> 00:57:44,848
大蜥蜴，跟你说的一样 入口在左边的阴影下
Just like you said, lizard man. "In the shadows to the left."

739
00:57:44,952 --> 00:57:48,183
出动
OK. Let's move!

740
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:51,656

741
00:57:51,726 --> 00:57:54,422
进入札克天王的城堡
and are making our way through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

742
00:57:54,528 --> 00:57:58,020
我看他是被冲昏了头
You know, I think that Buzz aisle went to his head.

743
00:57:58,132 --> 00:58:00,965
糟糕，往哪个方向？
Oh, no. Which way do we go?

744
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:03,127
这边 你怎么这么有把握？
- This way! - What makes you so sure?

745
00:58:03,204 --> 00:58:06,696
巴斯光年从不做没把握的事
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

746
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:10,043
我们被发现了 墙壁会把我们夹死
We've been detected. The walls! They're closing in! Quick!

747
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,511
马铃薯快帮我挡一下
Help me prop up vegetable man, or we're done for.

748
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,605
笨蛋，快放我下来
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

749
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:17,583
不是墙啦，是电梯
Guys, look! It's not the walls! It's the elevator!

750
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:28,125
我们来不及了 大伙儿，抓住我
Come on. We've got no time to lose. Everyone, grab hold!

751
00:58:28,195 --> 00:58:30,163
什么？
What?

752
00:58:30,264 --> 00:58:33,199
巴斯 为什么不直接坐电梯？
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?

753
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:35,895
这招会被他们料到
They'll be ex. Pecting that.

754
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:41,165
(残障停车位)

755
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,908
巴斯，等等
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

756
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,819
慢一点
Slow down!

757
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:57,720
六件隔天要送到日本的 快捷包裹要多少钱？
To overnight six. Packages to japan is how much?

758
00:58:58,292 --> 00:59:00,522
什么？是日园吧？
- What? That's in yen, right? - <i>No dollars sir.</i>

759
00:59:00,594 --> 00:59:01,993
美元？
- Dollars? - <i>Yes.</i>

760
00:59:02,062 --> 00:59:06,158
我在赶时间 你们是故意抢钱耶
You are deliberately taking advantage of people in a hurry, you know that?

761
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:09,225
好啦…好吧
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.

762
00:59:09,303 --> 00:59:12,534
我会在大厅等 你们最好十五分钟后到
I'll have the stuff in the lobby, and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,

763
00:59:12,606 --> 00:59:15,166
我要赶飞机，听到吗？
because I have a plane to catch, do you hear me?

764
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:20,947
我们终于要走了 你相信吗？
We're finally going. Can you believe it?

765
00:59:21,682 --> 00:59:25,015
那是特别订做的箱子
That's custom-fitted foam insulation you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

766
00:59:25,085 --> 00:59:27,315
这一趟要坐头等舱
First class all the way!

767
00:59:27,388 --> 00:59:31,119
老实说，我觉得很兴奋
You know what? I'm actually ex. Cited about this.

768
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,217
我是说真的
I mean it. I really am!

769
00:59:33,294 --> 00:59:34,727
那是当然了
And why shouldn't you be?

770
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:38,155
跟着舞伴左摇右晃
<i>Swing your partner do-si-do</i>

771
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:42,635
你是个跳舞的牛仔 瞧，我在跳方块舞耶
- Look at you, dancing cowboy! - Look! I'm doin' the box. Step!

772
00:59:52,346 --> 00:59:55,144
下面小心点
Hey, heads up down there!

00:59:55,249 --> 01:00:00,118
猪肚掉下来了 还有多远呀？
- Pork bellies are fallin'. - Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

774
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,190
就快到了
Halfway there.

775
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,555
我的手撑不下去了
My arms can't hold on much longer!

776
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:12,895
太重了
Too... heavy.

777
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,797
我真傻
What was I thinking?

778
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:17,736
我有反重力功能
My antigravity servos!

779
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,365
抓紧了，我要放手了
Hang tight, everyone. I'm going to let go of the wall.

780
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:22,999
什么？ 他不会吧
- What? - He wouldn't.

781
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,908
一 他会

01:00:24,979 --> 01:00:27,174
二 别放手…

飞向宇宙…浩瀚无垠
To infinity and beyond!

785

接近目标，恢复重力
Approaching destination. Reengaging gravity.

安全
Area secure.

787
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,095
没事了
It's OK, troops.

788
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:58,133
反重力引起的晕眩 马上就会消失，前进吧
The antigravity sickness will wear off momentarily. Now let's move!

789
01:00:58,212 --> 01:01:01,477
记得提醒我回去以后 要好好教训他一顿
Remind me to glue his helmet shut when we get back.

790
01:01:10,192 --> 01:01:13,127
翠丝，介绍我出场吧
How 'bout givin' me a little intro there, jessie?

791

我要介绍 西部最棒最酷的牛仔

795
01:01:33,748 --> 01:01:37,221
嘿，小妞，这儿有麻烦吗？
Say, little missy, you notice any trouble around these parts?

796
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:40,104
没有，胡迪警长会搞定一切
Nary a bit, not with Sheriff Woody around.

797
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:42,198
等等，我有了
Wait-wait-wait! I got it! This is great! OK!

救命呀，壳仓着火了
Help us! The barn's on fire!

800

801
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,543
胡迪又解除了危机
Woody saves the day again!

802
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:54,815
我的爱马红心呢？
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

803
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:57,550
我得潇洒的骑向落日
I have to ride off into the sunset...

804
01:01:57,624 --> 01:02:01,151
快马加鞭吧，红心
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

805
01:02:05,432 --> 01:02:07,900
别这样，我怕痒
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, OK?

806
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:09,799
是吗？
Oh, you are?

807
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,065
住手，别这样
No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.

808
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:14,107
快住手，住手

任务日志 这是札克的指挥舱
Mission log. Have reached Zurg's command deck,

810

811
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:31,754
那是胡迪

拜托，住手
Please, please, no!

814
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:40,626
你看得到吗？ 怎么回事？
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?

815
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:45,131
左边
- Take that! - To the left.

高一点 怎么回事？
- Take it up higher. - What's happening?

818
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:52,036
太可怕了，他们在拷问他
It's horrible. They're torturing him.

819
01:02:52,112 --> 01:02:55,411
我们该怎么办？ 用用你的脑袋
- What are we gonna do, Buzz? - Use your head!

820
01:02:55,482 --> 01:02:58,212
但是我不想要用我的脑袋
But I don't wanna use my head!

821
01:03:03,056 --> 01:03:05,422
这是怎么回事？
What's going on here?

822
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:07,653
巴斯，大伙儿 你们怎么找得到我？
Buzz, guys! Hey, how did you find me?

823
01:03:07,728 --> 01:03:08,854
小心点

824
01:03:08,929 --> 01:03:10,487
我们来救你了
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

825

听过无影腿吗？
You heard of kung fu?

826
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:14,326
尝尝我的火腿
Well, get ready for pork chop.

827
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:19,532
见识我愤怒双眼的威力
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

828
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,768
等等，你们搞错了 他们是我的朋友

- Yeah, we're his friends! - No, Rex., I mean <i>they're</i> my friends!

830
01:03:26,113 --> 01:03:29,514
站住，笨狗，给我放开他
Hey, stop it! You leave him alone, springy dog!

831
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:32,209
快去救胡迪
- Grab Woody, and let's go! - Fellas, hold it!

832
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:34,754
巴斯，放我下来 撤退，冲到通风孔
- Buzz, put me down! - Quick! To the vent!

833
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:37,551
他被抢走了
- They're stealing him! - No!

834
01:03:38,392 --> 01:03:39,791
大伙儿别动
Hold it right there!

835
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,760
巴斯 又是你
- Buzz? - You again?

836
01:03:41,862 --> 01:03:43,124
胡迪，幸好你没事
Woody! Thank goodness you're all right.

837
01:03:43,197 --> 01:03:44,664
这是怎么回事？
Buzz, what is going on?

838
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:48,326
慢着，我是巴斯光年 这里由我指挥
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear, and I'm in charge of this detachment.

839
01:03:48,402 --> 01:03:49,801
我才是巴斯光年
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

840
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,167
我是巴斯光年 我才是

841
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:53,331
谁是真的巴斯？
So, who's the real Buzz?

842
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,429
我是
- I am! - I am!

843
01:03:54,508 --> 01:03:55,975
别上这个冒牌货的当
Don't let this impostor fool you!

844
01:03:56,043 --> 01:03:59,535
札克训练他模仿 我的一举一动
He's been trained by Zurg himself to mimic my every move.

845
01:04:05,285 --> 01:04:06,343
(安弟)

846
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,409
巴斯
Buzz!

847
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:08,954
我就知道是你
I had a feelin' it was you.

848
01:04:09,022 --> 01:04:12,958
只是我有时候头尾不分
My front end just had to catch up with my back end.

849
01:04:13,026 --> 01:04:15,324
请你们解释好吗？
Will somebody please ex. Plain what's going on?

850
01:04:15,429 --> 01:04:18,489
没事了，太空战警 这是546密令
It's all right, space ranger. It's a code 546.

851
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,193

胡迪，你有危险，快走吧
Woody, you're in danger here. We need to leave now.

855
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:32,368
艾而要把你卖到 日本的博物馆
Al's selling you to a museum in japan!

856
01:04:32,446 --> 01:04:36,644
我知道，没关系 其实我也想去
I know. It's OK, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

857
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:38,344
什么？ 你疯啦？
- What? - Are you crazy?

858
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:41,319
我是稀有的胡迪警长玩偶
Look, the thing is, I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

859
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:44,255
他们是我的牛仔秀伙伴
and these guys are my Roundup gang.

860
01:04:44,324 --> 01:04:47,350
你在说什么呀？ 胡迪牛仔秀
- What are you talking about? - <i>Woody's Roundup!</i>

861
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:51,022
我是一个电视节目的明星
It's this great old TV show, and I was the star. See? Now look.

862
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:53,430
你看，你们看，那是我耶
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

863
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,992
我受不了了 我曾经轰动一时
- This is weirdin' me out. - Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

864
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,403
我还有一大堆周边商品 你们应该瞧瞧
There was all this merchandise that got packed up. You should have seen it.

865
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:03,408
唱机、溜溜球 我曾经是溜溜球耶
There was a record player and a yo-yo. Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

866
01:05:03,477 --> 01:05:06,571
曾经？ 别说傻话了，咱们走吧
- "Was"? - Stop this nonsense and let's go.

867
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:07,909
巴斯
Buzz.

868
01:05:09,983 --> 01:05:13,350
我不能丢下这些朋友
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

869
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,718
他们需要我才能进博物馆
They need me to get into this museum.

870
01:05:15,822 --> 01:05:19,485
否则他们就得回去储藏室 永远被关起来
Without me, they'll go back into storage. Maybe forever!

871
01:05:19,593 --> 01:05:23,552
你不是收藏品 你是给小孩玩的
Woody, you're not a collector's item. You're a child's plaything.

872
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,155
你是个玩具
You are a toy!

873
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:29,794
我还能撑多久？ 我再被扯破安弟就会抛弃我
For how much longer? One more rip, and Andy's done with me.

874
01:05:29,903 --> 01:05:32,269
到时候我该怎么办？ 你倒是说啊
And what do I do then, Buzz? Huh? You tell me.

875
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:35,706
我记得你曾经告诉我
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me

876
01:05:35,776 --> 01:05:38,836
当有小孩爱你时 生命才有价值
that life's only worth living if you're bein' loved by a kid.

877
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:42,404
我大老远跑来救你
And I traveled all this way to rescue that toy

878
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:44,450
因为我相信你的话
because I believed him.

879
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,045
你白跑一趟了
Well, you wasted your time.

880
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:56,021
走吧，大伙儿 胡迪呢？
- Let's go, everyone. - What about Woody?

881
01:05:57,197 --> 01:05:59,427
他不跟来了
He's not coming with us.

882
01:06:00,534 --> 01:06:03,731
今晚安弟要回家耶
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

883
01:06:03,804 --> 01:06:06,671
那我们最好赶回去等他
Then we'd better make sure we're there waiting for him.

884
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:20,218
我别无选择 这是我唯一的机会
I don't have a choice, Buzz. This is my only chance.

885
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:25,122
什么机会？永远隔着玻璃 看着小孩玩吗？
To do what, Woody? Watch kids from behind glass and never be loved again?

886
01:06:25,192 --> 01:06:27,126
真可悲
Some life.

887
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:34,256
大家都没事吧？ 胡迪警长
- <i>Is everybody OK?</i> - <i>Sheriff Woody!</i>

888
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:37,792
你救了我们 记住了，小朋友
- <i>I knew you'd make it!</i> - <i>Now remember deputies</i>

889
01:06:37,904 --> 01:06:40,600
家人和朋友才是你们的一切
<i>the real treasures are</i> <i>your friends and family.</i>

890
01:06:40,674 --> 01:06:44,235
我在走之前 想要跟你们分享这首歌
<i>Before I go kids I want to share</i> <i>somethin' special with you</i>

891
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:46,973
太好了
- <i>for the times I'm not around.</i> - Good going, Woody!

892
01:06:47,047 --> 01:06:48,639
终于摆脱他们了
I thought they'd never leave.

893
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:51,081
我是你好朋友
<i>You've got a friend in me</i>

894
01:06:51,151 --> 01:06:53,551
我是你好朋友
<i>You've got a friend in me</i>

895
01:06:55,222 --> 01:06:57,156
胡迪 如果你有麻烦
- Woody? - <i>You've got troubles</i>

896
01:06:57,224 --> 01:07:00,057
我会来帮忙
<i>Well I've got 'em too</i>

897
01:07:00,127 --> 01:07:04,154
我愿为你赴汤蹈火
<i>There isn't anything</i> <i>I wouldn't do for you</i>

898
01:07:04,231 --> 01:07:07,132
只要团结就能解决
<i>We stick together</i> <i>and see it through</i>

899
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,499
因为我是你好朋友
<i>'Cause you've got a friend in me</i>

900
01:07:12,439 --> 01:07:16,000
也许别人比我聪明一点
<i>Some other folks might be</i> <i>a little bit smarter than I am</i>

901
01:07:16,076 --> 01:07:18,544
也比我高大比我强
<i>Bigger and stronger too</i>

902
01:07:18,612 --> 01:07:20,409
也许吧
<i>Maybe</i>

903
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,109
但是从来没有人
<i>But none of them will ever love you</i>

904
01:07:24,184 --> 01:07:26,015
像我这么爱你
<i>The way I do</i>

905
01:07:26,086 --> 01:07:28,748
我们是好朋友
<i>It's me and you boy</i>

906
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:31,586
一年一年过去
<i>And as the years go by</i>

907
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:36,654
我们的友谊更加坚固
<i>Our friendship will never die</i>

908
01:07:36,863 --> 01:07:40,663
我这是在干嘛？
- What am I doing? - <i>You're gonna see it's our destiny</i>

909
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:43,794
巴斯，等等我 你要去哪里？
- Buzz! Wait! Wait! - Woody, where are you going?

910
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:47,306
你说得对，安弟一定会长大
You're right, Prospector. I can't stop Andy from growing up.

911
01:07:47,374 --> 01:07:49,706
但是我不想错过每一刻
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

912
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,903
不! 巴斯
- No! - Buzz!

913
01:07:51,978 --> 01:07:53,570
干嘛？
- Yes? - Yes?

914
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:55,046
我要跟你们走
I'm coming with you!

915
01:07:55,115 --> 01:07:58,312
等一下，我马上回来
Wait... wait... wait. I'll be back in just a second.

916
01:07:58,385 --> 01:08:00,285
干得好，牛仔
Way to go, cowboy!

917
01:08:00,454 --> 01:08:04,015
大伙儿，跟我一起来吧 什么？
- Hey, you guys... Come with me. - What?

918
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,251
安弟会跟我们一起玩
Andy will play with all of us. I know it!

919
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:08,419
胡迪，我不晓得耶
Woody, I... I... I don't know. I...

920
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:12,158
难道你不想再陪伴爱咪莉吗？
Wouldn't you give anything just to have one more day with Emily?

921
01:08:12,232 --> 01:08:16,601
翠丝，最重要的是 让一个小孩快乐
Come on, jessie. This is what it's all about: To make a child happy.

922
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:19,798
你心里很明白 红心，你来不来？
And you know it. Bullseye, are you with me?

923
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:22,775
好马儿
OK, good boy.

924
01:08:22,843 --> 01:08:24,811
老矿工，你说呢？
Prospector, how 'bout you?

925
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:31,545
老矿工？ 你离开盒子了
- Prospector? - You're outta your box!

926
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:35,117
我试着跟你讲道理
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

927
01:08:35,188 --> 01:08:38,817
但是你逼得我不择手段
but you keep forcing me to take extreme measures.

928
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,818
昨晚是你打开电视 不是翠丝
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV last night, not jessie.

929
01:08:43,897 --> 01:08:47,458
我们要永远一起留在博物馆
Look, we have an eternity to spend together in the museum.

930
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:50,264
你不要破坏咱们之间的感情
Let's not start off by pointing fingers, shall we?

931
01:08:50,337 --> 01:08:52,498
你真的很可恶耶
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?

932
01:08:52,572 --> 01:08:53,971
老矿工，这样很不公平
Prospector, this isn't fair.

933
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,532
不公平？什么叫不公平？
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

934
01:08:57,644 --> 01:09:03,139
我一辈子都坐在架子上 看着别的玩具被卖走
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store shelf watching every other toy be sold.

935
01:09:03,216 --> 01:09:05,446
现在我终于熬出头
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

936
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:10,547
一个臭牛仔 休想坏了我的好事
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll is gonna mess it up for me now!

937
01:09:12,225 --> 01:09:14,887
巴斯 救命呀，巴斯
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

938
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:19,057
太迟了 那个撒隆巴斯帮不了你
It's too late, Woody. That silly Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

939
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:21,362
他的名字是巴斯光年
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

940
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:25,700
随便啦 我最讨厌太空玩具了
Whatever. I've always hated those upstart space toys.

941
01:09:25,772 --> 01:09:28,172
卡住了，怎么办？
It's stuck! What do we do?

942
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,607
要用我脑袋吗？
Should I use my head?

943
01:09:32,012 --> 01:09:33,001
是艾而
It's Al!

944
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:37,842
我快赶不及了
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

945
01:09:37,918 --> 01:09:40,079
我不能错过班机，我得打包
Figures. I can't miss this flight! I've gotta pack.

946
01:09:40,153 --> 01:09:42,383
钱包、钥匙、机票
All right. Let's see. Wallet, keys, tickets,

947
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:45,356
护照、牛肉干…在日本很贵
passport, beef jerky, very ex. Pensive over there.

948
01:09:45,425 --> 01:09:48,121
洗澡 来不及洗了
Shower! I can skip the shower.

949
01:09:48,194 --> 01:09:52,096
我得走了
I just gotta get outta here now!

950
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:54,757
快去坐电梯
<i>Quick! To the elevator!

951
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:01,899
快点，电梯来了
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

952
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,715
巴斯光年，我们又见面了
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,

953
01:10:09,783 --> 01:10:11,410
这次你死定了
for the last time.

954
01:10:11,484 --> 01:10:15,318
是札克天王 小心，他有离子炮
It's Zurg! Watch out! He's got an ion blaster!

955
01:10:29,569 --> 01:10:32,037
快上电梯
<i>Quick! Get on!

956
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:37,041
紧急逃生口，快点
The emergency hatch! Come on!

957
01:10:56,830 --> 01:11:01,233
来吧，快点 巴斯有危险耶
- Come on! Hurry! - But Buzz is in peril!

958
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:04,270
巴斯光年…拯救世界
<i>Buzz... Buzz...</i> <i>Buzz... Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

959
01:11:14,014 --> 01:11:17,882
投降吧，巴斯光年，我赢了
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

960
01:11:17,951 --> 01:11:20,852
我不会投降，你杀了我父亲
I'll never give in. You killed my father!

961
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,016
不，巴斯，我就是你父亲
No, Buzz. I <i>am</i> your father.

962
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:28,957
不!

963
01:11:31,064 --> 01:11:32,497
快点…快点…
Come on! Come on! Come on!

964
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:39,737
巴斯，你可以打败札克
Buzz, you could have defeated Zurg all along!

965
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:42,741
你只要相信自己
You just need to believe in yourself!

966
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:46,336
领死吧 我不敢看
- Prepare to die! - I can't look!

967
01:11:53,386 --> 01:11:58,346
我成功了 我终于打败札克了
I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

968
01:11:58,425 --> 01:11:59,983
爸爸
Father.

969
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,292
终于到了
Finally!

970
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:36,021
我们该怎么救他？
How are we gonna get him now?

971
01:12:37,161 --> 01:12:38,822
谁要吃比萨？
Pizza, anyone?

972
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,090
(比萨星球)

973
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:42,098
快走，快走 我接到了
- Go, go, go! - I got it!

974
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,258
巴斯，你来不来？
Buzz, are you coming?

975
01:12:43,334 --> 01:12:47,361
不了，我要多陪陪我爸爸
No, I have a lot of catching up to do with my dad.

976
01:12:48,372 --> 01:12:52,399
丢得好，乖儿子 跑远一点，小巴斯
Good throw, son. That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

977
01:12:52,477 --> 01:12:56,345
你是个好爸爸，万岁 再见了
- You're a great dad. - Farewell.

978
01:12:56,447 --> 01:12:58,210
有人会开车吗？
Does anyone know how to drive?

979
01:12:58,282 --> 01:13:00,580
弹簧狗，踩油门 抱抱龙，看方向
Slink, take the pedals. Rex., you navigate.

980
01:13:00,685 --> 01:13:03,586
火腿和蛋头，控制按键
Hamm and Potato, operate the levers and knobs.

981
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,055
陌生人 外面来的
- Strangers. - From the outside.

982
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:13,290
惨了 是红灯，快追上去
- Oh, no. - He's at a red light! We can catch him!

983
01:13:13,364 --> 01:13:14,695
弹簧狗，全速前进
Max. Imum power, Slink!

984
01:13:16,868 --> 01:13:19,234
绿灯了，快点
It turned green! Hurry!

985
01:13:19,303 --> 01:13:21,965
为什么不动？ 你们要用动力棍
- Why won't it go? - Use the Wand of Power.

986
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,446
抱抱龙，往哪儿？ 左，我是说右
- Rex., which way? - Left! No, no! I mean right!

987
01:13:32,517 --> 01:13:35,509
对了，左边才对
That's right! No, I mean left! Left is right!

988
01:13:35,586 --> 01:13:40,614
巴斯，他左转了
Buzz, he's turning left! He's turning left!

989
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:42,659
天啊
Oh, boy!

990
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:47,554
这辆车吃油吃得很凶
I seriously doubt he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

991
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,396
右转!右转!
Go right! To the right! Right-right-right-right!

992
01:13:54,839 --> 01:13:57,467
你救了我们 我们永远感谢你
You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful.

993
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,032
好啦，随便啦

994
01:14:01,612 --> 01:14:03,671
(国际机场)

995
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:11,051
白线只准卸货或上下乘客

不能停这儿，这是白线
Guys, we can't park here! It's a white zone!

你救了我们 我们永远感谢你
You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful.

1000
01:14:22,266 --> 01:14:24,166
他在那儿

1001
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:26,863
前往东京的班机马上起飞

1005
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:41,474
别缠着我，好吗？ 有人来了
- Will you leave me alone? - Someone's coming!

1006
01:14:41,552 --> 01:14:44,214
小狗狗
- A puppy! - Bark-bark-bark-bark.

1007
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:46,779
汪汪汪…
Bark-bark-bark-bark-bark.

1008
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:47,846
给我听好，小飞仔
Listen, flyboy.

1009
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:50,860
箱子里的东西你赔不起
The contents of that case are worth more than you make in a year!

1010
01:14:50,928 --> 01:14:53,328
t不t？ 我明白
- You got that? You be careful! - I understand, sir.

1011
01:14:53,397 --> 01:14:55,763
给我小心点 没有「易碎」的标签吗？
Do you have a "fragile" sticker or something?

1012
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,267
我带过一盒饼干 结果变成饼干屑
