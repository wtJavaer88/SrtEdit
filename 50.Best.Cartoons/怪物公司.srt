我的朋友都叫我痰痰
My friends call me Phlegm.

10
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
胆汁先生 你哪步错了?
Mr. Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?

11
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,640
我跌倒了?
I fell down?

12
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,780
不是 在那之前
No, no, before that.

13
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,890
谁知道他到底犯了什么错误吗?
Can anyone tell me Mr. Bile's big mistake?

14
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,090
有人知道吗?
Anyone?

15
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,720
我们看看录影带 来吧
Let's take a look at the tape. Here we go.

16
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,140
就在...那儿 那扇门 你没关好
Right there. See? The door. You left it wide open.

17
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,960
没把门关好是天大的错误 为什么?
And leaving the door open is the worst mistake any employee can make because...

18
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,430
冷风会吹进来?
It could let in a draft?

19
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,130
小孩子会闯进来
It could let in a child.

20
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,110
荷特路老板
Mr. Waternoose.

21
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,040
人类小孩是世上 最毒最致命的东西
There's nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child.

22
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,330
摸一下就会死人
A single touch could kill you.

23
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,480
门没关好 小孩就能走进来
Leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory,

24
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,350
闯进怪兽世界
right into the monster world.

25
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,720
我才不进去 死都不去
I won't go in a kid's room. You can't make me.

你一定要去 我们需要这个
You're going in there because we need this.

27
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,730
我们要靠你们 收集小孩的尖叫声
Our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams.

28
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,040
没有尖叫声就没有电力
Without scream we have no power.

29
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,910
这工作很危险
Yes, it's dangerous work.

30
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,510
所以你们一定要全力以赴
And that's why I need you to be at your best.

吓人怪兽一定要 有自信 有耐力
I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough.

神勇飙悍 凶猛可怕
Intimidating.

33
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,750
最高竿的怪兽就是...
I need scarers like... Like James P. Sullivan.

34
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,080
詹姆士・苏利文
I need scarers like... Like James P. Sullivan.

35

Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's five after 6:00 a.m.

The temperature's a balmy 65 degrees which is good for you reptiles.

38
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,870
这种天气最适合赖床
And it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to lie in bed, sleep in,

39
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,580
或是锻练垂在床边的赘肉
or simply work off that flab that's hanging over the bed!

40
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,340
毛怪 起床喽
Get up, Sulley!

41
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,160
大眼仔 我可没要求叫床服务
I don't believe I ordered a wake up call, Mikey.

42
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,240
废话少说 棉花糖小子
Less talk, more pain, marshmallow boy!

43
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,970
快用力 你这算什么怪兽?
Feel the burn. You call yourself a monster?

44
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,330
快快跑...小孩醒了
Scary feet, scary feet. The kid's awake!

45
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,850
快快跑...小孩睡着了
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet. Kid's asleep!

46
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,870
双胞胎 上下铺
Twins! In a bunk bed!

47
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,720
我差点就把你考倒
I thought I had you there.

48
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,910
毛怪 准备好 盯着它
OK, Sulley, here we go. You ready? Follow it. It's over here.

49
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,460
在这边 这边... 别让小孩碰到你
Over there. Don't let the kid touch you. Don't let him touch you!

50
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,980
大家都知道 吓小孩最好玩
I don't know but it's been said I love scarin' kids in bed

51
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,420
牙齿一定要美白 怪兽不能有蛀牙
Fight that plaque. Scary monsters don't have plaque.

52
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,870
118 119 加油 你还行吗 再来一下
One eighteen. Do you have 119? Do I see 120?

53
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,720
棒呆了
I don't believe it.

54
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,110
我连一滴汗都没流
I'm not breaking a sweat.

55
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,660
我不是说你啦 播广告了

我忘了交一份报告
I forgot about some paperwork I was supposed to file.

303

大眼仔提醒了我 多谢了
Mike was reminding me.Thanks, buddy.

304
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,360

Man, I have no idea what puce is.

313
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,610
原来是这张
Oh, that's puce.

但这是最棒的一次
But this is the best birthday ever.

325
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,300
你在看什么?
What are you looking at?

326
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,440
我想到第一次见到你的情形
I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you,

327
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,870
你有多么美 讨厌啦
how pretty you looked. Stop it.

328
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,420
当时你的头发比较短
Your hair was shorter.

329
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,690
我正想剪短
I'm thinking about getting it cut.

330
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,960
不 这样就好
No, no, I like it this length.

331
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,690
我喜欢你的一切
I like everything about you.

332
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,200
前几天有人问我 觉得哪个怪兽最美
Just the other day someone asked who was the most beautiful monster.

333
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,380
你知道我说谁吗? 你说谁?
You know what I said? What did you say?

334
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,290
我说是...

336
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,410
我不是说他美啦
No, no, that's not what I was gonna say.

337
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,840
你在胡言乱语
You're not making sense.

338
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,950
好巧 你们也在这儿
He's handsome. He's rugged. What a coincidence, running into you.

340
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,420
大眼仔

341
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,840
不晓得有什么好吃的

You're ruining everything.

343

我去拿你的报告 结果有一道门
I went to get your paperwork and there was a door.

344
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,580
什么?
What?

345
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,320
一道门? 蓝道在里面
A door? Randall was in it.

346
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,880
蓝道?
Randall?

347
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,040
他在作弊 他在偷偷加班
That cheater.He's trying to boost his numbers.

348
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,170
没那么简单
There's something else.

349
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
什么?
What?

350
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,740

352
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,050
什么袋子?
What bag?

353
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,820
这儿没有我爱吃的 保重了 先生
They don't have anything I like here. Take care, Celia.

354
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,570
大眼仔 这是怎么回事?
What's going on?

355
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,010
西莉亚 别怪我 我有别的事要做
Celia, please try to understand.I have to do something!

356
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,850
大眼仔?
Michael?

357
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,890
我数到三 一...二...
On three. One, two...

358
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,630
小孩子
A kid! Boo!

359
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,650
一个小孩子
A kid!

360
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,620
这儿有一个人类小孩
There's a kid here. A human kid!

361
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,680
大帅哥
Googly bear!

00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,620
来吧
Come on.

363
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,890
快闪人吧
Let's get out of here.

364
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,850
保持冷静 这不是演习
Please remain calm. This is not a drill.

365
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,750
发生835号状况
7835 in progress, please advise.

366
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,140
大眼仔?
Michael? Michael!

367
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,210

Come with me. Stop pushing.

369
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,850
放开我的马子
Get your hands off my schmoopsie pooh.

370
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,450
建筑物净空 准备清除污染
Ready for decontamination.

371
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,760
我的约会被搞砸了
I don't think that date could have gone any worse.

372
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,450
(小孩危机)

373
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,100
如果目击证人说的没错
If witnesses are to be believed, there has been a child security breach

374
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,370
人类小孩第一次入侵怪兽城市
for the first time in monster history.

375
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,040
我不承认 也不否认有人类小孩
We neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here.

376
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,250
一个小孩子飞过去 用雷射眼炸毁一辆车
Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision.

377
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,830
没错 她用念力把我吊起来乱晃
I tried to run, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll.

378
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,150
是真的 我都看见了
It's true. I saw the whole thing.

379
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,490
以我的专业素养来看
It is my professional opinion

380
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,810
现在最好惊声尖叫
that now is the time to panic.

381
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,910
她来了
It's coming. It's coming!

382
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,910
不...
No, no, no, no!

383
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,750
给我过来
Come here, kid.

384
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,750
别乱碰
Don't touch those, you little...

385
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,240
那是按字母顺序排好的
Those were alphabetized. It's OK.

386
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,390
没关系 她不过来就没事
As long as it doesn't come near us we're gonna be OK.

387
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,440
我要坐
I would like to sit

388
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,910
你喜欢吗?
You like this?

389
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,840
去捡吧
Fetch.

390
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,870
够了 你不能碰小麦克
Hey, hey. That's it. No one touches Little Mikey.

391
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,950
把玩具熊给她
Mike, give her the bear.

392
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,520
不好了
Oh, no!

393
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,600
快哄她别哭
Make it stop, Sulley. Make it stop!

394
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
瞧 你看 玩具熊
Here, look. See bear?

395
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,030
玩具熊耶
Nice bear.

396
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,180
毛怪
Sulley!

397
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,290
玩具熊
Bear, he's a happy bear.

398
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,440
小乖乖 别哭 否则我就有麻烦
He's not crying, neither should you. We'll be in trouble

399
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,710
被他们逮到就完蛋 别哭了
'cause they're gonna find us, so please stop crying now.

400
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,950
很好 你很会哄小孩 快乐小熊熊
Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up. You're doing great. He's a happy bear. He has no...

401
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,170
她碰到我了 毛怪 把玩具熊给她
It touched me. Sulley, the bear! The bear. Give her the...

402
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,670
那是怎么回事?
What was that?

403
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
我也不知道
I have no idea,

404
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,800
不过她最好别再来一次
but it would be really great if it didn't do it again.

405
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,040
我怎么会这么蠢?
How could I do this? How could I be so stupid?

406
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,530
这会毁了公司
This could destroy the company.

407
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,700
管它的公司 我们完蛋了
Who cares about the company?What about us?

408
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,130
那玩意是杀人机器
That thing is a killing machine.

409
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,720
她会等我们睡着了再下毒手
It's waiting for us to fall asleep and then wham!

410
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,890
现在我们只能坐以待毙
We're easy prey, my friend. We're sitting targets.

411
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,920
我有个点子
OK, look, I think I have a plan here.

412
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,930
我们要拿一堆汤匙
Using mainly spoons,

413
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,430
挖一条隧道 然后把她丢到野外去
we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild.

414
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,920
汤匙?
Spoons.

415
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,160
我想不到了
That's it. I'm out of ideas.

416
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,770
热空气球太贵了 大弹弓太显眼了
Air balloon, too expensive.Giant slingshot, too conspicuous.

417
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,950
木马 太像希腊神话了?
Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.

418
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,370
没辄了...想不起来...死定了
No. Can't think. Can't think.Flatliner. Flatlining.

419
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,300
大眼仔 她好像困了
Mike? I think she's getting tired.

420
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,290
快找地方给她睡觉吧
Well, then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep

421
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,650
让我慢慢想办法
while I think of a plan!

422
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,560
困了吗 你想睡吗?
Are you sleepy? Wanna sleep? Is that what you want?

423
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,180
我铺张报纸给你睡
OK. I'll make a nice little area for you to...

424
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,550
那是我的床 你会把细菌弄上去
No. Hey, that's my bed. You're gonna get your germs all over it.

425
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,690
好吧 反正睡椅子也很舒服
Fine. My chair's more comfortable anyway.

426
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,520
怎么了?
What?

427
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,680
那只是衣橱 快睡吧
It's just a closet. Will you go to sleep?

428
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,380
那看起来像蓝道
Hey, that looks like Randall.

429
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,870
蓝道是吓你的怪兽
Randall's your monster.

430
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,250
你以为他要出来吓你
You think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you.

431
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,800
我该怎么解释?
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

432
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,400
衣橱是空的 你看
It's empty. See?

433
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,350
里面没有怪兽
No monster in here.

434
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,030
现在有了 不过我不会吓你
Well, now there is. But I'm not gonna scare you.

435
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,350
我下班了
I'm off duty.

436
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,420
好吧 我坐在这儿等你睡着
OK. How about I sit here until you fall asleep?

437
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,340
快睡吧 快睡
Go ahead. Go to sleep.

438
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,980
马上睡
Now. Now go.

439
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,650
你...去...睡...觉
You go to sleep.

440
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,330
也许我疯了
Mike, this might sound crazy,

441
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,950
但是我看她没有危险
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.

442
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,930
是吗 那敢情好?
Really? Well, in that case, let's keep it.

443
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,970
我一直都想养只 会吃怪兽的宠物
I always wanted a pet that could kill me!

444
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,530
把她放回门里去就行了
What if we just put her back in her door?

445
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,220
什么? 只要把她送回去装作没事
What? Mike, think about it.We send her back,

446
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,760
一切都会恢复正常
everything goes back to normal.

447
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,890
那是笑话吗 你在说笑吗?
Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking.

448
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,100
拜托 我一直忍耐到现在
Sulley, I think that given the circumstance I've been extremely forgiving till now.

449
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,770
但这是什么馊主意?
But that is a horrible idea.

450
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,790
难道我们要带着她出门
Are we gonna march in public with that thing?

451
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,010
大摇大摆走进公司吗?
Then I guess we waltz right up to the factory, right?

452
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,760
我们竟然大摇大摆走进公司
I can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory.

453
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,020
抹布加沙发布可骗不了人

我怎么不知道?

00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,420
不如带这小鬼去吧 她肯定大受欢迎
We could bring your cousin's sister's daughter. She'll be a big hit.

她不能进来 这是男厕
She can't stay here. This is the men's room.

494
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,510
你的想法好怪 小孩又不介意
That is the weirdest thing you've ever said.

495
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,500
你看 她高兴得跳起舞来了
Look. It loves it here. It's dancing with joy.

496

我拿到磁卡就回来

好了吗
Hello?

502
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,030
她跑到哪儿去了?
Where did she go?

503
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,100
她不见了 她隐形了吗?
Did she disappear? Did she turn invisible?

504
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,150
我不知道耶
I just have no idea.

505
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,050
逮到你了
Gotcha.

506
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,110

Is that a new haircut? Tell me, it's a new haircut.New makeup.

510
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,800
你去拉了皮 对吧?
You had a lift. You had a tuck. You had something.

511
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,080
你脸上注射肉毒杆菌...
Something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...

512
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,210
帮我个忙
I need a favor.

513
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,760
蓝道昨晚跑来加班
Randall was working late last night on the scare floor.

514
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,300
我要他那道门的磁卡
I need the key for the door he was using.

515
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,670
那敢情好
Well, isn't that nice?

516
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,640
猜怎么着 你昨晚没交报告?
But guess what? You didn't turn in your paperwork last night.

517
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,570
他有啦...没有吗?
He didn't... No paperwork?

518
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,010

This office is now closed.

00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,420
你在搞什么?
Fee, fi, fo... What are you doing?

522
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,480
我在找那小孩子
I'm looking for the kid.

523
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,470
她不见了?
You lost it?

524
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,570
不 她只是...

525
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,150
她在这儿
Here she is.

526
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,860
怎么了?
Hey. What's the matter?

527
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,340
我说过我什么也没看见
I already told your buddies... All right. Carry on.

528
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,900
蓝道 完了 那小孩该怎么办?
Randall. Thank goodness. What are we gonna do about the child?

529
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,320
(小孩出现在寿司店)

530
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,610
你找的那小孩上了头条耶
It's on the front page. The child. The one you were after.

531
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,050
给我闭嘴 我知道啦
Be quiet. Don't you think I'm aware of the situation?

532
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,150
我找了她整晚
I was up all night trying to find it.

533
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,290
我粗略算过寿司店的坪数
I did a calculation factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant.

534
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,020
那小孩可能逃走了
The child may have escaped!

535
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,590
我们要假装什么事都没发生
Until we know for sure we're gonna act like nothing happened.

536
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,660
你去搞定机器 我来搞定小孩
Get the machine running. I'll take care of the kid.

537

不管是谁把她放出来 都死定了
When I find whoever let it out, they're dead.

538

They're gone.

541
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,650
情况不妙 糟糕透顶
This is bad, so very bad.

542
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,310
他们说什么机器? 管它的
What were they talking about, machine? Who cares?

543
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,840
别急 找到她的门就送她回家
All we have to do is call her door and send her home.

544
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:41,450
没错 我们只是普通的员工 就跟别人一样
Right. We're just two regular Joes on our way to work. We will blend right in.

Did you lose weight? Or a limb?

548
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,130
拿到磁卡吗?
You have her card key, right? Of course.

549
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,110
当然拿到了 我说我要去拿

现在磁卡就在我手中
Now I have her card key.

551
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,450

OK. Here we go.

552
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,450
保重了 别再偷溜进来哦
Take care of yourself. Try not to run through any more closets.

553
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,830
这不是她的门
Mike, that's not her door.

554
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,760
你说什么 当然是罗?
Of course it's her door.

555
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,560
她的门是白色上面有花 不是
No. Her door was white and it had flowers on it.

556
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,350
你一定看走了眼 这就是了
It must have been dark last night because this is its door.

557
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,640
听到吗 好像很好玩?
Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun in there.

558

Go fetch. Mike, this isn't Boo's door.

564
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,240
阿布是谁?
Boo? What's Boo?

565
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,490
我决定这么叫她
That's what I decided to call her.

566
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,210
不行吗?
There a problem?

567
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,060
你不能替她取名字啦
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.

568
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,030
取了名就有感情
Once you name it, you start getting attached to it.

569
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,780
让她回到属于她的地方吧
Now put that thing back where it came from, or so help me...

570
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,410
我们正在排演一出舞台剧叫...

571
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,470
"让她回到属于她的地方"

It's a musical.

573
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,920
让她回到属于她的地方
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me

574
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,230
上帝保佑我
So help me, so help me

575
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,640
卡
And cut.

576
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,590
还没练好啦 我们需要带位小弟
We're still working on it. It's in progress, but we need ushers.

577
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,700
够了 说再见吧 她跑哪儿了?
Sulley, I've had enough. Say goodbye to... Where did it go?

578
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,380
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

579
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,400
天啊 她又跑掉了?
She got away from you again?Well, that is just...

580
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:22,590
等等 走运了 太完美了
Wait a minute. The sun is coming up. This is perfect.

581
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,330
她不见了
She's gone!

582
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,990
你上哪儿 拜托 别走
Where are you going? Sulley, don't blow this.

583
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
你就快打破记录了
We're so close to breaking the record.

584
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,740
让别人找她 这是他们的问题
Somebody will find the kid. It'll be their problem.

585
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,960
我们解套了
She's out of our hair!

586
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,370
你们在干么?
What are you two doing?

587
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,810
他们在排演一出戏
They're rehearsing a play.

588
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,660
她已经走了
She's out of our hair

589
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,460
闭嘴 大眼仔
Can it! So, what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan?

590
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,230
小孩闯进来那件事 有够夸张了 是很夸张
Pretty crazy? Oh, yeah, crazy.

591
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,600
听说她是从这儿跑进来的
Word is the kid's been traced to this factory.

592
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,370
你没看到什么吧?
You haven't seen anything?

593
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,270
这...
Well...

594
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,270
没有 不过如果有内应
No. No way.But if it was an inside job,

595
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,100
我打赌一定是韦斯福 韦斯福?
I'd put my money on Waxford.

596
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,610
他的眼神很闪烁
Waxford? The one at station six.He's got them shifty eyes.

597
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,710
韦斯福
Hey, Waxford.

598
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,650
毛怪
Sulley!

599
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,240
麦克华斯基
Michael Wazowski!

600
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,020
昨晚是我这辈子 最丢脸的一夜
Last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!

601
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,120
你一点都不关心我
I thought you cared about me. Honey, please.

602
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,790
我以为你爱吃寿司 寿司
I thought you liked sushi. Sushi! Sushi!

603
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,650
你以为我是跟你吵这个吗?
You think this is about sushi?

604
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,430
麦克华斯基
Wazowski.

605
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,420
麦克...
Michael!

606
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,450
男人真是的...
Men.

607
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,080
放轻松...
Breathe. Keep breathing.

608
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,040
那小孩子呢?
Where's the kid? Kid?

609
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:54,210
什么小孩? 她在公司 对吧?
What kid?It's here in the factory, isn't it?

610
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,560
你不能怪在我头上
you can not blame on me

611
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,350
是你作弊才把她放出来的
It never would have gotten out if you hadn't been cheating last night.

612
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:58,830
作弊?
Cheating?

613
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,890
作弊 没错
Cheating. Right.

614
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,420
我知道该怎么解决这问题
OK. I think I know how to make this all go away.

615
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,420
再过五分钟 响起铃声会怎样?
What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?

616
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,950
我能喊暂停?
I get a timeout?

617
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,330
大家都去吃午饭
Everyone goes to lunch.

618
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,220
意思就是工厂会怎样?
Which means the scare floor will be...

619
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,550
重新油漆?
Painted? Empty.

620
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,910
工厂会空无一人啦 猪头
It'll be empty, you idiot.

621
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,460
看到那时钟吗?
You see that clock?

622
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,780
当时针和分针都指向上面
When the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up,

623
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,290
我就会把那小孩的门 调到我的工作站
the kid's door will be in my station.

624
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:38,820
当分针指向下面 门就会不见
But when the big hand points down, the door will be gone.

625
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:43,880
你要在那之前把小孩送回去 懂了吗?
You have until then to put the kid back. Get the picture?

626
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,430
阿布
Boo!

627
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,160
不... 你 站住
No. Hey, you. Halt.

628
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,830
就是他
He's the one.

629
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,880
拍广告的明星
The one from the commercial.

630
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,410
就是他
That's him.

631
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,870
请你帮我们签名
Can we get an autograph?

632
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,850
好 没问题
Oh, sure. No problem.

633
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,590
请签给我女儿贝瑟妮
Make that out to Stephanie, my daughter.

634
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,870

Yes. Let's see.

635
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,430
来自可怕朋友的祝福
"From your scary friend. Best wishes..."

636
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,500
我说 "你敢再闹 我就不理你"
So, then I said, "If you talk to me like that again, we're through".

637
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,960
她怎么说?
What'd she say?

638
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,740
你知道我老妈 她罚我进房间 回头见
You know my mom. She sent me to my room. See you guys later. Take it easy.

639
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,440
倒光了
Bottoms up.

640
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:43,990

The kid needs to take off a few pounds.

705
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,140
你这独眼蛇 她在哪儿?
Wazowski! Where is it, you little one eyed cretin?

706
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,210
是独眼龙啦 你的国文也未免太差了
It's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me, do it properly.

707
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,410
而且把我抓来 才不能帮你打破记录
Second, you're nuts if you think kidnapping me is gonna help you cheat!

708
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,220
你还是以为我想 打破那蠢记录吗?
You still think this is about that stupid scare record?

709
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:57,180
是呀 不过看到你冷笑
Well, I did. Right up until you chuckled like that.

710
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,940
我想我该走了
Now I think I should get out of here.

711
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,640
我要彻底改革吓人工业
I'm about to revolutionize the scaring industry.

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,490
就连伟大的毛怪 都要替我打工

714
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,810
你最近可忙得很
Well, somebody's certainly been a busy bee.

715
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,150

First I need to know where the kid is and you're gonna tell me.

716

我不知道
I don't know.

717
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,080
才怪
Sure.

718
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,260

I don't. I don't.

719
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,720

Hey, hey. This thing is moving.

723
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,380
我不喜欢会动的大玩意
I don't like big moving things that are moving towards me.

724
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,180
不 蓝道 快住手
No. Come on. Hey!

725
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:41,640
跟尖叫声提炼机说声"哈罗"
Randall! Say hello to the scream extractor.

726
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,100
"哈罗"
Hello.

727
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:46,180
你要上哪儿 喝杯拿铁聊聊嘛?
Where you going? We'll talk. We'll have a latte.

728
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,100
别这样 有话好说嘛
Come on. We can talk about this.

729
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:54,750
那是什么东西?
What is that thing?

730
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:59,500
等等 不 快停下来
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. No. Come on.

救命啊!救命!
Help. Help! Help, help!

732
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,100
这次你又哪出错了?
For... What did you do wrong this time?

733
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,210
不晓得 我都弄好了
I don't know. I calibrated the...

734
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,870
快去给我检查
Go check the machine.

735
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,990
一定是阀门塞住了 这种机型都有这毛病
There must be something wrong with the scream intake valve.

736
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,600
方格斯...
Fungus? Fungus?

737
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,680
你爱车吗?
You like cars?

738
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,440
我的车超炫的
I got a really nice car.

739
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,170
你放我走我就...载你一程
If you let me go, I'll give you a ride in the car.

740
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,570
拜托啦
Please, Fungus.

741
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,280
抱歉 华斯基
I'm sorry, Wazowski,

742
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,730
蓝道说我不能跟受害者交谈
but Randall said I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.

743
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,220
怎么了 大眼仔呢?
What happened? Where's Wazowski?

744
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,970
他在哪里?
Where is he?

745
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,950
来吧 他疯了 他要杀了我们
Come on. This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.

746
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,690
小心 可能受到污染
That could be contaminated.

747
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,720
我们得赶快逃命
We gotta get out of here now!

748
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,260
我们要到遥远的地方 去过全新生活
We could start a new life far away. Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.

再见了 怪兽电力公司 再见了 荷老板
Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.

00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,960
大眼怪 等等
No, Mike, wait.

751
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,000
你在干么?
Hey, what are you doing?

752

跟我来 我有个点子
Follow me. I have an idea.

753

模拟程式结束... 不对...
Simulation terminated. No, no, no, no, no.

755
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,400
那算什么?
What was that?

756
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,940
你要吓唬小孩 不是哄他们睡觉
You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.

757
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:53,990
我这是蛇拳加忍者的招数 加上吐舌头
I was going for a snake/ninja approach with a little hissing.

758
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,790
我说过多少次 你要有架势
How many times do I have to tell you? It's all about presence.

759
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,590
上场一定要威风凛凛
About how you enter the room.

760
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,050
荷老板
Mr. Waternoose!

00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,160
詹姆士 你来得正好
James, perfect timing.

762
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,000
不 你不明白
No, no, sir. You don't understand.

763
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,590
让这群菜鸟瞧瞧你的厉害 不行...
Show these monsters how it's done. I can't.

764
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,420
老板 你得听我说
Sir, you have to listen to me.

765
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,120
注意看 他是高手中的高手 老板 我...
Pay attention.You're about to see the best in the business.

766
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,200
重新设定模拟机
Reset the simulator.

767
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,010
可是老板...
But sir!

晚安 小乖乖 晚安 妈咪 好好睡...
Good night, sweetheart. 'Night, Mom.

769
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,600
大猫咪 不要...
Kitty! No, Boo, no!

770
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,980
来一个惊天动地的吼声
Give us a big loud roar.

771
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,850
荷老板 来不及了
There's no time for this!

772
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,580
快吼呀 你在等什么?
What are you waiting for? Roar.

773
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,200
可是... 快吼呀
But, sir... Roar!

774
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,930
干得好 詹姆士
Well done. Well done, James.

775
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,420
阿布?
Boo? All right, gentlemen.

776
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,180
各位 希望你们都学会了 好 我们往这边走啊
Right this way. I hope you've learned a lesson today.

777
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,980
阿布?
Boo.

778
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,020
阿布
Boo.

779
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,190
阿布 是我呀
Boo, it's me.

780
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,010
那个小孩
The child!

781
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,420
荷老板 她没有毒
Sir, she isn't toxic.

782
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,990
你也许不信 但相信我
It sounds crazy, but trust me.

783
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,090
阿布 没事了 我只是...
Boo? No, no, no, no, it's OK. I was just... No.

784
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,060
好... 别害怕
No, don't be scared. That wasn't real.

785
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,240
那不是真的 我只是...
It's just a... I was just...

786
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,040
阿布
Boo.

787
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,120
他要把她当实验鼠
...test it out on that sweet girl.

788
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,440
现在他想杀我们灭口
Boo. ...have her, he is trying to kill us.

789
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,680
这都是蓝道的错
This is Randall's fault.

790
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,740
蓝道? 对
Randall?

791
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,580
我可以带你到 他的秘密实验室
We can take you to his secret lab

792
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,820
就在工厂里头
in this factory.

793
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,360
怎么会有这种事?
How could this happen? How could this happen?

794
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,220
有别人知道吗?
Does anyone else know about this?

795
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,980
没有
No, sir.

796
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,890
那就好
Good.

797
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,950
这公司不能再有负面消息
This company can't afford any more bad publicity.

798
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:09,710
我们最好先把 这小孩处理掉再说
Now, before we do anything else, let's take care of the child.

799
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,440
没想到事情会搞到这地步
I never thought things would come to this.

800
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,210
尤其是我的公司
Not in my factory.

801
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:24,230
很遗憾把你们扯进来 尤其是你 詹姆士
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this. Especially you, James.

802
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,150
现在要把事情解决掉
But now we can set everything straight again.

803
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,610
这都是为了公司好
For the good of the company.

804
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,760
这不是她的门
Sir? That's not her door.

805
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,380
我知道
I know, I know.

806
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,440
这是你们的门
It's yours.

807
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,820
不
No!

808
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,190
阿布
Boo!

809
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,920
不...不...
No! No! No, no, no, no!

810
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,120
太迟了 我们被放逐了
It's too late. We're banished, genius!

811
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,860
我们到了人类世界
We're in the human world.

812
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,530
去找荷老板真是好主意
What a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose.

813
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,600
可惜他也有一份
Too bad he was in on the whole thing.

814
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,190
你只要听我的话就没事了
All you had to do was listen to me.Just once!

815
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,510
但是你就是不肯听
But you didn't, did you?

816
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,140
你还是没在听
You're still not listening!

817
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,270
吃我一拳
Take that!

818
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,160
欢迎光临喜马拉雅山
Welcome to the Himalayas.

819
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,570
可怕的大雪人 你们相信吗?
Abominable. Can you believe that?

820
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,440
我看起来很可怕吗?
Do I look abominable to you?

821
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,760
为什么不叫我可爱的大雪人?
Why can't they call me the Adorable Snowman

822
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:53,240
或是可喜的大雪人?
or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud?

823
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,900
我是个大好人耶
I'm a nice guy.

824
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,120
吃雪糕吗?
Snow cone?

825
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,820
放心 这是柠檬口味
No, don't worry. It's lemon.

826
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,330
大个子 你呢 雪糕?
How about you, big fella? Snow cone?

827
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:09,040
你看到她的眼神吗?
Did you see the way she looked at me?

828
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:15,030
真可怜 我知道被放逐很难受
Poor guy. I understand. It ain't easy being banished.

829
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,580
我老友大脚哈利被放逐后
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.When he was banished,

830
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:21,100
用毒藤编了一件大尿布
he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.

831
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,010
还戴在头上自称为湿疹王
Wore it on his head like a tiara.Called himself King Itchy.

832
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:28,510
别难过了 你们算幸运了
It won't be so hard for you guys. How lucky can you get?

833
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,210
跟好朋友一起放逐
Banished with your best friend.

834
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,910
他不是我的朋友
He is not my friend.

835
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,990
你们搂搂抱抱的 我还以为是呢
I just assumed you were buddies. When I saw you in the snow hugging...

836
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,180
这猪头毁了我 全为了一个蠢小孩
Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life. And for what? A stupid kid!

837
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:43,900
你害我困在冰天雪地的荒原
Because of you I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland.

838
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,530
荒原 这可是乐园
Wasteland? I think you mean wonderland.

839
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,800
多么美丽的雪地
How about all this fabulous snow?

840
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,410
还有当地的小村庄 好可爱
And wait till you see the local village.Cutest thing in the world.

841
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,540
更别说免费的牦牛奶
I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.

842
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,100
你说什么?牦牛奶
What did you say? Yaks' milk.

843
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:01,200
喝牦牛奶可不容易
Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.

844
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,790
不过只要把毛拿掉就很营养
Once you pick the hairs out it's nutritious.

845
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,250
那座小村庄有小孩吗?
No, about a village. Are there kids in it?

846
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,730
当然有 坏小孩 乖小孩
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,

847
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,860
爬在石头上的小孩
kids who climb on rocks.

848
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:10,680
在哪儿?
Where is it? At the bottom of the mountain.

849
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,650
山脚下 三天路程
A three day hike.

850
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,110
三天 我们马上就得赶到?
Three days? We need to get there now.

851
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,150
你想去村庄吗?
You wanna go to the village?

852
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,650
好 第一条规则
Rule number one out here, always... No.

853
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:36,250
千万别在暴风雪中出去
Never go out in a blizzard.

854
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,060
我们得去救阿布
We need to get to Boo.

855
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,800
阿布 那我们呢?
Boo? What about us?

856
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,760
自从你见到她 就不肯听我的话
Ever since the kid came in, you've ignored everything I've said,

857
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,290
你看看我们的下场
and now look where we are!

858
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,010
我们就快打破世界记录了
We were about to break the record.We would have had it made.

859
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,520
这都不重要
None of that matters now.

860
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,940
这都不重要 等等...
None of it matters? Wait a second.

861
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,890
这一切都不重要?
None of it matters?

862
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,420
好吧 真是太好了
OK. No, good. Great.

863
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,850
你终于说了实话
So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?

864
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,960
你们瞧 雪糕没有了
Would you look at that? We're out of snow cones.

865
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,400
我到外面去做一些
Let me just go outside and make some more.

866
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,530
我们努力的一切呢?
Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for?

867
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,840
那也不重要吗?
Does that matter?

868
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,790
西莉亚呢?
What about Celia?

869
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:31,010
我不能再见到她了
I am never... Never gonna see her again.

870
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,290
这不重要吗?
Doesn't that matter?

871
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,870
还有我呢?
And what about me?

872
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,420
我是你的死党 你的好友
I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.

873
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,380
我也不重要吗?
Don't I matter?

874
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:52,870
我很抱歉 害你被困在这儿
I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

875
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:57,410
我不是故意的 但阿布有危险
I didn't mean for this to happen. But Boo's in trouble.

876
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,440
我有办法救她 只要我们...
I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get...

877
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,280
我们...我们?
We? Whoa. We?

878
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,830
不 这次没有我们
No. There's no "we" this time, pal.

879
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:12,850
你想跑到外面冻死 我可管不着
If you want to go out there and freeze to death, you be my guest.

880
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,980
我跟你分道扬镳了
Because you're on your own.

881
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,430
我做了雪糕耶
Hey, I got more snow cones!

882
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,490
加油 乔治 我知道你行的
Come on, George. I know you can do this.

883
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,690
我挑了很容易的门
I picked out an easy door for you.

884
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,000
在尼泊尔 与世无争的尼泊尔

888
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,790
抱歉 乔治
Sorry, George.

889
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:01,170
你不能就这样...
Hey, you can't just...

890
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,430
出了状...
Twenty three...

891
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,810
快闪开
Out of the way!

892
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,200
终于搞定了
Finally.

893
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:18,260
早知道我就不应该相信你
I never should have trusted you with this.

894
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,030
你害我放逐了 我最顶尖的吓人怪兽
Because of you, I had to banish my top scarer.

895
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,660
有这机器根本就不需要他们
With this machine, we won't need scarers.

896
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,770
苏利文是活该倒霉
Sullivan got what he deserved.

897
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,890
他比你吓人得多了
Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be.

898
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,030
大猫咪
Kitty!

899
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:51,990
大猫咪
Kitty!

900
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:52,720
苏利文
Sullivan?

901
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:00,330
大猫咪
Kitty!

902
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,410

等那道门一到就切断电源
When the door lands in the station, cut the power.

1028
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:00,310
然后再去抓孩子和罪魁祸首
You'll have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess.

他没跟来 我们安全了
I think we stopped him, Boo. You're safe now.

1048

当个乖女孩 好吗?
You be a good girl, OK?

1049

她回家了 放过她吧
She's home. Leave her alone.

1051
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,400
办不到 你跟她都知道太多了
I can't do that. She's seen too much.

1052
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,290
你不必这么做
You both have. It doesn't have to be this way.

1053

我别无选择 时代变了
I have no choice. Times have changed.

1054
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:52,270
光是吓人不够了 你也不能绑架小孩
Scaring isn't enough anymore. But kidnapping?

1055

我愿意绑架一千个小孩救公司
I'll kidnap 1,000 children before I let the company die.

1056
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,630
谁敢挡我的路 我就要杀人灭口
And I'll silence anyone who gets in my way!

1057
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,250
不
No!

1058
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,270
晚安 妈咪...晚安 甜心
Night, Mom. Night, sweetheart.

1059
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:03,970
晚安 妈咪这算什么?
Night, Mom. What is this?

1060
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:09,260
模拟程式结束...
Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated.

1061
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,860
我不知道你们发现没
Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys,

1062
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,360
不过我看到好几个错误
but I spotted several big mistakes.

1063
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,430
可是 怎么会?
But how did...

1064
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:19,970
这样吧 咱们再看一遍好了
You know what? Let's watch my favorite part again. Shall we?

1065
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,740
我愿意绑架一千个小孩救公司 什么...
I'll kidnap 1,000 children before I let this company die.

1066
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:27,110
我愿意绑架 一千个小孩救公司...
I'll kidnap 1,000 children before I let this company die.

1067
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,200
请跟我们来
Come with us. What are you doing?

1068
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:35,320
把臭手拿开 你们不能逮捕我
Take your hands off. You can't arrest me.

1069
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,990
这下你满意了吧 
I hope you're happy, Sullivan.

1070
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,870
你毁了怪兽电力公司
You destroyed this company.Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

1071
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,500
尖叫声要从哪里来?
Where will everyone get their scream?

1072
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,090
你把能源危机搞得越来越糟
The energy crisis will only get worse because of you!

1073
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:55,370
站着别走 局长要跟你们谈谈
Stay where you are. Number one wants to talk to you.

1074
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,390
立正
Attention.

1075
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,580
你们好
Hello, boys.

1076
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,650
罗丝?
Roz? Roz?

1077
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,160
当你拦截到那个小孩
Two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted

1078
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:16,260
我两年半的卧底行动 差点就泡汤
when you intercepted that child, Mr. Sullivan.

1079
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,630
不过没有你的帮忙
Of course, without your help,

1080
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:22,830
我也想不到荷老板竟然是主谋
I never would have known that this went all the way up to Waternoose.

1081
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:29,250
至于那小女孩
Now, about the girl.

1082
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,480
我只想送她回家
I just want to send her home.

1083
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,890
很好 把碎门机拿来
Very good.Bring me a door shredder.

1084
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:40,230
什么 我不能再见到她?
What? You mean... You mean I can't see her again?

1085
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,230
这是没办法的
That's the way it has to be.

1086
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,650
我给你们五分钟
I'll give you five minutes.

1087
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,010
再见了 小鬼
Well, so long, kid.

1088
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,150
麦克华斯基
Mike Wazowski.

1089
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,210
对
Yeah.

1090
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,840
阿布 这很好玩

1091
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,030
去吧 长大吧
Go ahead. Go grow up.

1092
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,910
阿布
But, Boo...

1093
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,080
阿布
Boo.

1094
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:37,050
你看看 是啊
Look at that. You know...

1095
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:40,200
很可爱
That's cute. Yeah.

1096
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,690
阿布
Boo...

1097
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:46,500
你真好
Well, that's very nice.

1098
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:47,990
过来
Come here, you!

1099
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,830
它是快乐的玩具熊...
Oh, he's a happy bear

1100
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,790
怪兽不会再跑出来吓人了
Nothing's coming out of your closet to scare you anymore, right?

1101
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,560
是呀
Yeah.

1102
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,420
再见了 阿布
Goodbye, Boo.

1103
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,960
大猫咪
Kitty.

1104
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,810
大猫咪要走了
Kitty has to go.

1105
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,000
大猫咪
Kitty?

1106
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:18,400
当作这一切都没发生过
None of this ever happened, gentlemen.

1107
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,580
我也不想看到报告
And I don't want to see any paperwork on this.

1108
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,450
把他带走吧
Take him away.

1109
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:51,800
我打赌会放一天假
I bet we get the rest of the day off.

1110
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,090
猪头 公司要倒了啦
You idiot. They're gonna shut down the factory.

1111
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,570
你应该看到荷老板的表情
When that wall went up, you should have seen Waternoose's face.

1112
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:03,380
我真想要那卷录影带
I hope we get a copy of that tape.

1113
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,930
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1114
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:08,350
开心点 我们送她回家了
Come on, pal. Cheer up. We did it! We got Boo home.

1115
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:11,020
虽然我们害公司倒闭
Sure, we put the factory in the toilet and

1116
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,420
几百个人会失业
hundreds of people will be out of work.

1117
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:16,290
断电了还会有暴民 来追杀我们
Not to mention the mob that will come after us when there's no power,

1118
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:19,900
不过这过程充满了笑声
but at least we had some laughs, right?

1119
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:25,220
笑声
Laughs.

1120
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,790
麦克风有开吗 试音...
Is this thing on? Hello? Hello? Testing.

1121

晚安 大家好吗?
Good evening. Nice to see you.

1122
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,490
很高兴来到...你房间 你是哪里人?
It's great to be here in your room. Where are you from?

1123
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,390
算了 你念幼稚园吧?
You're in kindergarten, right?

1124
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,620
我的幼稚园生涯最快乐
I love kindergarten.Best three years of my life.

1125
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:02,780
最快乐耶
Of my life.

1126
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:06,090
我最爱运动 尤其是躲避球
But I love sports.Dodgeball was the best.

1127
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,920
我跑得最快 因为我就是球
I was the fastest one out there. Of course, I was the ball.

1128
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:13,250
我就是球 了解吗?
I was the ball, see...

1129
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,390
好啦
All right.

1130
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:31,670
谢了 我有一礼拜的档期
Thanks a lot. I'll be here all week.

1131
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:33,330
别忘了给小费
Remember to tip your waitresses.

1132
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,180
干得好 第一个小孩你就达到标准了
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota on the first kid of the day.

1133
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,040
不错嘛
Not bad.

1134
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:46,500
只有最棒的喜剧高手 才这么有办法
Only somebody with perfect comedic timing could produce this much energy in one shot.

1135
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:51,720
而且笑声的能量 比尖叫声强十倍
And the fact that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream had nothing to do with it?

1136
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:55,900
电眼帅哥 过来
Googly bear, come here, you.

1137
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,800
蛇蝎美人
Schmoopsie pooh! Googly.

1138
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,480

Girls, stop, stop, stop.

01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,810
麦克 你好有吸引力
Michael, you're such a charmer.

1140

杂志带来了吗? 送来了一整箱

1141
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,610
给我看
Let me see it!

1142
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,690
我和毛怪登上封面
Sulley and I made the cover, right?

1143
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,170
(怪兽电力公司第一名)

1144
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,050
我不敢相信
I don't believe it!

1145
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,120
好棒
Googly bear.

1146
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,080
我登上杂志封面了
I'm on the cover of a magazine!

1147
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,050
棒呆了
This is great.

1148
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,350
(笑声工厂)

1149
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:52,830
(第一年产量)

1150
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,130
毛怪麦克 怎样?
Hey, Sulley. Hey, Mike.

1151
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:02,940
你有空吗 我给你看样东西?
I was... There's something I want to show you.

1152
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:04,990
闭上眼睛跟我来 来呀 我...
Close your eyes. Follow me.

1153
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,670
别偷看
Come on. No peeking.

1154
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:11,870
一直走...
Keep coming, keep coming. Come on. Mike!

1155
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:14,430
跟着我迷人的声音
Follow the sultry sound of my voice.

1156
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,850
好了 站住 张开眼睛
OK, stop. Open 'em.

1157
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:21,560
大眼仔
Mike,

1158
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:23,450
这真的是...
is that...

1159
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:27,450
我花了好久 才把木块拼起来
Sorry it took so long, pal. There was a lot of wood to go through.

1160
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:31,100
每一块都要拼完才算成功
It only works if you have every piece.

1161
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,960
阿布?
Boo?

1162
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,390
大猫咪
Kitty!
