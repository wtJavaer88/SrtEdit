1
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,680
冰河世纪

2
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,280
为什么不管这叫“大寒”或者“冷冻时代”
Why not call itthe Big Chill or the Nippy era?

3
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,380
我是说我们怎么知道这是“冰川时代”？
I'm just saying,how do we know it's an ice age?

4
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,110
因为四周全是冰！
Because of all the ice.

5
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,080
就连说话也冷冰冰的
Well, things just got a little chillier.

6
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,760
救命
Help. Help.

7
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,160
来吧，孩子，我们走，大伙儿都在走呢！
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's moving.

8
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,560
可是，可是，可是，爸爸
But, but, but, Dad.

9
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,470
别说“可是”还轮不到你绝种呢
No buts. You can play extinction later.

10
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,160
噢，OK，走吧，伙计们
OK. Come on, guys.

11
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,540
我说……艾迪在哪儿？
So, where's Eddie?

12
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,430
啊，他说他马上就要出现一个“进化上的突破”了
He said he was on the vergeof an evolutionary breakthrough.

13
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,540
是吗？
Really?

14
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,750
噢，我飞了！
I'm flying.

15
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,250
好一个突破
Some breakthrough.

16
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,920
小心！你走错方向了！
- Look out.- You're going the wrong way.

17
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,990
你这毛象疯子！
Crazy mammoth.

18
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,540
嘿！你就帮个忙吧！别挡着道妨碍交通！
Do the world a favor.Move your issues off the road.

19
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,070
如果我也是短鼻子我就不会那么抢眼了，老弟！
If my trunk was that small,I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

20
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,880
别臭我了我们……都挪了一整天了
Give me a break.We've been waddling all day.

21
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,450
那就接着走吧，随大流吧
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

22
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,750
你们走了就清静了
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

23
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,880
走吧，他要冻死就随他去
Come on. If he wants tofreeze to death, let him.

24
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,070
嘿，嘿，我醒了，醒了
I'm up. I'm up.

25
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,300
大家都快起来吧！呃？扎克？马歇尔？
Rise and shine, everybody.Huh? Zak? Marshall?

26
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,680
伯蒂？“真菌”叔叔？
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

27
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,510
大家都去哪儿了？来吧，伙计们，我们该迁…该迁…迁徙了
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,we're gonna miss the migration.

28
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,480
扔下我就走了他们每年…都这么干！
They left without me.They do this every year.

29
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,490
为什么？谁都不爱我了吗？
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

30
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,190
难道谁都不关心我这可怜的树懒希德了吗？
Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?

31
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,040
好吧，那我就自己走
All right, I'll just go by myself.

32
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,340
噢，恶心！
Sick.

33
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,110
嘿，巨无霸！别随地大小便！
Wide body, curb it next time.

34
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,710
噢，天，噢，唉唷！噢！
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

35
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,620
真不敢相信，新鲜绿叶菜弗兰克，你在哪儿找到的？
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.Frank, where did you ever...?

36
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,860
好了，快吃吧是蒲公英？
- Go ahead. Dig in.- A dandelion.

37
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,530
还以为都被冻死了就剩下这一棵
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.- All but one.

38
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,770
唷,唷,这实在让我太我要咬他的…啊
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

39
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,700
我呸！今天我算是倒霉透了我的意思你应该懂吧？
This has definitely not been my day.You know what I'm saying, buddy?

40
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,510
简直一团糟，你们犀牛的脑袋实在是小，你们知道吗？
What a mess. You rhinos have tiny brains. Did you know that?

41
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,340
这是事实，我没有恶意也许我的话你们根本不懂
It's just a fact. No offense. You probably didn't even know what I'm talking about.

42
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,720
呵呵呵呵，噢，美味呀！
Yummo.

43
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,920
是蒲公英呀！一定是最后一棵了
A dandelion. Must bethe last one of the season.

44
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,360
卡尔？冷静，弗兰克
- Carl.- Easy, Frank.

45
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,490
他糟蹋了我们的色拉
He ruined our salad.

46
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,670
呃，呃，噢，噢，是我错了
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

47
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,030
伙计们，我错了，我赔我赔呃，这是什么？
No, no, seriously, let me take care of this. What is this?

48
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,810
是松果啊！噢，老天，我最爱吃了！
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.They're my favorite.

49
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,210
唔，味道好极了嗷，这真…呃，真好吃
Delicious. That's good eating.

50
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,810
你们可不能让我独享了你们也吃点
But don't let me hog them all up.Here, you have some.

51
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,690
味道不错吧？祝你们胃口好
Tasty, isn't it? "BON APPITITE(法语)."

52
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,220
上吗？
Now?

53
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,760
上
Now?

54
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,700
假装我不在我是想全速把他撞倒
- Just pretend that I'm not here.- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

55
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,070
别急，我们“玩玩”他.别让他们刺穿我，拜托了，我想活命
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

56
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,510
你走开！行了，你就别撒泼了
- Get off me.- Come on, you're making a scene.

57
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,390
我们只要把那毛小子戳爆然后就走
We'll just take our furry pinata and go.

58
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,480
嘿，小子，逃得了今天也逃不过明天
If it's not them today,it's someone else tomorrow.

59
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,890
反正我今天不想死，OK？
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

60
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,390
听着，我们戳断你的脖子你不会痛苦的，怎么样？
We'll break your neck so you don't feel a thing.

61
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,590
等一下，你们犀牛应该是食草动物吧？
Wait a minute. I thought rhinos were vegetarians.

62
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,830
真精辟！闭嘴！
- An excellent point.- Shut up.

63
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,530
谁说我们把他杀了之后要吃他？
Who says we're gonna eat him after we kill him?

64
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,530
我不喜欢以杀为乐的动物
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

65
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,070
谁爱听…就跟谁说吧恰好我就爱听
- Save it for a mammal that cares.- I'm a mammal that cares.

66
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,480
好吧,如果你们俩有谁过得了前面这个坑，树懒就归你们
OK, if either of you make it across that sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

67
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,440
没错，孬种往前跨一步就死定了！
That's right, you losers.You take one step and you're dead.

68
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,260
你在吓唬他们？对，这“坑”不会沉
- You were bluffing, huh?- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

69
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,160
收拾他！
Get him.

70
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,260
是蒲公英？
A dandelion?

71
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,270
哇！我们胜利了！
We did it.

72
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,440
你的眼睛真美！快滚下我的脸！
- You have beautiful eyes.- Get off my face.

73
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,750
噢，你和我，我俩配合默契不如结伴一起去南方吧
Whoa, we make a great team.What do you say we head south together?

74
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,350
好啊，耶！嘿，跳到我背上来一路放轻松
Great. Jump on my backand relax the whole way.

75
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,460
哇噢，当真？
- Wow, really?- No.

76
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,060
等等，你不去南方？季节的变换，迁徙的本能
Wait, aren't you going south?The change of seasons, migration instincts.

77
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,900
这些挺耳熟吧？不，再见了
- Any of this a-ringing a bell?- I guess not. Bye.

78
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,900
好吧，多谢帮忙我自己走吧
OK, then. Thanks for the help.I can take it from here.

79
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,680
嘿，你象只大号的鼬鼠有种等我们下来
You overgrown weasel.Wait till we get down there.

80
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,240
何必一窝蜂地去南方又热又挤的，没意思
That south thing is way overrated.The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

81
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,880
还是这样好，你和我两个单身汉在荒野中闲逛
Isn't this great? You and me,two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

82
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,780
不，你是想要保镖生怕自己被活吞了
No, you just want a bodyguard so you don't become somebody's side dish.

83
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,260
你这家伙还真够精明的
You're a very shrewd mammal.

84
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,290
那你带路吧先生，你叫…叫啥来着？
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...Didn't get the name.

85
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,390
曼福雷德曼福雷德？难听
- Manfred.- Manfred? Yuck.

86
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,740
不如叫“曼尼-忧郁的毛象”“曼尼-深沉的愁思者…曼尼…”
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

87
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,300
别再跟着我
Stop following me.

88
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,810
好吧，好吧，你有心事听着，你就当我不在，我会闭嘴
OK, so you've got issues. You won'teven know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

89
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,790
噢，你快瞧啊那可爱的…小宝宝，迭戈
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

90
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,600
把他拿来当早餐一定很美妙没有他怎么能算早餐？
- lsn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

91
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,500
尤其因为他爸爸杀了我们一半的同胞，穿上我们的毛皮取暖
Especially since his daddy wiped out halfour pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

92
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,710
以牙还牙，你看怎么样？
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

93
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,380
让那人知道跟剑齿虎斗是什么下场
Let's show him what happens when he messes with sabers.

94
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,690
通知大伙儿，我们黎明进攻
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

95
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,320
迭戈，把那孩子带来，要活的
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

96
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,650
如果要好好享受报仇那最好是活吞
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,I want it to be fresh.

97
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,250
噢，累死我了
Phew. I'm wiped out.

98
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,260
你用这点过夜？嘿，你块头大，你有很多木头
- That's your shelter?- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

99
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,130
我是小不点儿所以只要半根
- I'm a little guy.- You got half a stick.

100
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,590
可…有我的小木棍和我高度进化的脑子…我能生出…火！
But with my little stick and my highly evolved brain, I shall create fire.

101
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,800
了不起
Fascinating.

102
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,200
看看智慧是不是能战胜蛮力你瞧着吧
We'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

103
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,480
嘿，我看见火花了
Think I saw a spark.

104
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,950
呃，我能不能进来跟你一块挤一挤，曼尼老伙计？
Any chance I could squeeze in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

105
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,550
呃，你还是去烦别的家伙吧
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

106
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,230
朋友、亲戚或者毒蛇什么的
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

107
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,300
我全家丢下了我他们不管我…自己迁徙了
My family abandoned me.They just kinda migrated without me.

108
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,040
他们去年还要过分
You should see what they did last year.

109
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,870
他们很早醒来然后绑住我的手脚
They woke up early andtied my hands and feet

110
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,740
用田鼠塞住我的嘴并且把洞门堵上
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

111
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,480
他们走水路这样我就闻不出它们的气味
covered their tracks, went through water so I'd lose their scent,

112
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,390
反…反正…我也不需要他们
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

113
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,290
你怎么样？有家庭吗？
So what about you? You have family?

114
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,660
好吧，看来你累了我们天亮再谈
OK, you're tired. I see.We'll talk more in the morning.

115
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,730
曼福雷德！你挪过去点好吗？
Manfred? Manfred?Could you scooch over a drop?

116
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,940
噢，得了哪会这么快就睡着的！曼尼！
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

117
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,070
曼尼
Manny

118
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,080
迭戈来了，我们撤
There's Diego. Fall back.

119
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,520
小孩在哪儿？在瀑布那儿追丢了
- Where's the baby?- I lost it over the falls.

120
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,220
你追丢了？
You lost it?

121
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,660
我要那小孩，迭戈我能找到
- I want that baby, Diego.- I'll get it.

122
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,440
但愿如此不然的话被活吞的就是你
You'd better, unless you want to serve as a replacement.

123
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,910
我们去“半峰”山去那儿会合
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

124
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,340
最好把他活着带来
It had better be alive.

125
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,140
能完成这任务吗？迭戈？
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

126
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,740
我们走！
Let's go.

127
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,540
她看见我肩上的那根毛就说如果你找别的女伴风流
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,"lf you have an extra mating dance,

128
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,240
至少找一个毛的颜色相同的
at least pick a female with the same color pelt."

129
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,780
我想“完了”我要成她的盘中餐了
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go praying mantis on me."

130
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,590
如果你有了配偶就该对她忠诚，你很幸运了
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.In your case, grateful.

131
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,990
你给我走开一辈子守着一个太蠢了
- Now get away from me.- I think mating for life is stupid.

132
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,290
那也太亏了我这“能干”的希德
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

133
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,890
曼尼？
Manny?

134
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,590
曼尼？
Manny?

135
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,920
快瞧啊，他没事
Look at that. He's OK.

136
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,900
他妈妈不见了
She's gone.

137
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,880
你是不是忘了什么？
- Manny, are you forgetting something?- No.

138
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,280
可…可你刚救了他可上次救的那个我还没甩掉呢
- But you just saved him.- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

139
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,880
你不能把他留在这儿
But you can't leave him here.

140
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,460
瞧，有烟他的那群人在山上
Look, there's smoke.That's his herd right up the hill.

141
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,660
我们把他送回去我跟你说白了吧，根本没有“我们”
- We should return him.- Let's get this straight. There is no "we."

142
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,370
从来就没有“我们”，其实没有我，这会我连“你”都没了
There never was a "we." In fact,without me, there wouldn't even be a "you."

143
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:08,170
只是去山上你给我仔细听好，我就是不去！
- Just up the hill.- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

144
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,350
行啊，做你的混球，我会照顾他的噢，好，太好了
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.- Yeah, that's good.

145
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,880
你连自己都照顾不了我倒要瞧瞧
You can't even take care of yourself.This, I gotta see.

146
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,250
我送你回去我们不需要那坏蛋毛象，对吗？
I'll return you. We don't need that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

147
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,490
不需要他
No, we don't.

148
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,320
你真给大自然丢脸这你知道吗？
You're an embarrassment to nature.Do you know that?

149
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,170
小菜一碟，我行，我行
Piece of cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

150
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,260
我会送命的
I'm gonna die.

151
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,210
曼尼
Manny.

152
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,930
唔…那小东西是我的不对，这小东西是我们的
- That pink thing is mine.- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

153
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,370
“我们”？你们“小俩口”真是“绝配”啊
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

154
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,280
没有“我们”！
There is no "us."

155
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,700
懂了自己生不出，所以领养一个
I see. Can't have one of your own,so you want to adopt.

156
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,910
对不起，搅了你吃“点心”可我们得走了
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt your snack, but we gotta go.

157
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,580
吃小孩？得了，我是要把他送回去
The baby? Please.I was returning him to his herd.

158
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,750
噢，行呀，真有你的，“龅牙”
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

159
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,920
你说我在撒谎？我没这么说
- Calling me a liar?- I didn't say that.

160
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,090
你就是这么想的
You were thinking it.

161
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,760
我不喜欢这家伙他猜透我心思
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

162
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,960
我叫迭戈，朋友曼福雷德，我不是你朋友
- Name's Diego, friend.- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

163
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:14,300
好吧，别白费劲找人类了他们今天早上走了
Fine, Manfred. If you're looking for the humans, you're wasting your time. They left.

164
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,540
谢谢你的建议，现在滚吧
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

165
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,710
好吧，我帮你把他送回去但你得保证完事后不缠着我
I'll help you bring it to its herd,but leave me alone after that.

166
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,350
好吧，说定了，你哪儿不对劲？全都因为你
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?- You are my problem.

167
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,780
你是因为太紧张，所以你吃那么多注意减肥就不会胖了
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

168
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,990
我不胖，是因为这毛皮让我显得…臃肿
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.It makes me look poofy.

169
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,990
好吧，那你有“肥毛”如果有烦心事想说，我听着
All right, you have fat hair.But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

170
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,530
你干嘛？把他放在岩脊上
What are you doing? Just drop it on the ledge.

171
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,870
应该保证他们能看见好主意
- We should make sure they found him.- Good idea.

172
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,370
等等，等等
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

173
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,580
啊！别…刺我！
Don't spear me.

174
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,790
呃…这下麻烦了怎么了？
- This is a problem.- Now what?

175
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,310
噢，这下可好
That's perfect.

176
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,050
我说过他们都走了瞧谁来了
- I told you they were gone.- Look who it is.

177
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,860
找不到弱小的动物让你开膛破肚了？
Don't you have some poor animal to disembowel?

178
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,750
噢，他们走不远的，往这边走了或，或或，或…这边
They couldn't be far. I mean,they went this way, or this way?

179
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,200
你不太懂追踪，对吗？
You don't know much about tracking, do you?

180
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,160
嘿，我是树懒，看见树就吃叶子，我管这叫“追踪”
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

181
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,540
他们没走多久
You didn't miss them by much.

182
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,000
这还青着两小时前，往北去了
It's still green.They headed north two hours ago.

183
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,480
这还青着两小时前，往北去了
It's still green.They headed north two hours ago.

184
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,510
你们不用这么折腾
You don't need this aggravation.

185
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,310
把孩子给我我能比你们更快找到人类
Give me the baby. I can track humans down a lot faster than you.

186
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,120
你真是个热情相助的好公民
And you're just a good citizen helping out?

187
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,720
我知道人类去哪儿了“冰川道”
- I just know where the humans are going.- Glacier Pass.

188
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,430
谁都知道他们在另一边有个居住地
Everybody knows they havea settlement on the other side.

189
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,330
如果你们不懂追踪，在大雪封住通道前就找不到他们
Unless you know how to track, you'll never reach them before snow closes the pass.

190
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,500
大雪封路可能…是明天
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

191
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:33,440
所以，要么把孩子给我要么在暴风雪中迷路，你们选择吧
So, you can give that baby to me,or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

192
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,050
抱着你的心肝宝贝我们把他还给人类
Here's your little bundle of joy.We're returning it to the humans.

193
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:50,060
大坏蛋“老虎叔叔”被我们扔下不管了，可怜的“老虎叔叔”
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.Poor tigey-wigey.

194
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,970
希德，“老虎叔叔”负责带路
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

195
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,200
呃，呃，曼尼我能不能跟你谈谈？
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

196
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,070
不，我们早点找到人类，我就能早点摆脱这流口水的臭家伙
No. The sooner we find the humans,the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

197
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,670
还有这孩子
and the baby, too.

198
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,410
“金刚巨象”不会时刻保护你的
You won't always have Jumbo around to protect you.

199
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:16,120
哪天你没了保护，我劝你最好小心点，因为我会偷袭你
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back, cos I'll be chewing on it.

200
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,020
嘿，“追踪大师”，到前面来，好让我看见！
Nier-tracker. Up front, where I can see you

201
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,760
救救我
Help me.

202
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,150
噢，你别让他再哭了我再也受不了了！
You gotta make it stop.I can't take it anymore.

203
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,450
没他这么会闹的我也吃过他不停扭动
- I've eaten things that complained less.- He won't stop squirming.

204
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,650
小心他的头！你把他放下！
- Watch its head.- Put it down.

205
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
唏，“抱起来，放下他”
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

206
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,890
他的鼻子是干的那他一定是生病了
- lts nose is dry.- That means something's wrong with it.

207
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,960
谁来给他舔舔，以防万一我来吧
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.- I'll do it.

208
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,560
嘿，他包着尿布呢！怎么？
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.- So?

209
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,330
如果他拉屎，就拉尿布里
So if he poops, where does it go?

210
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,700
人类真是恶心好吧你，检查大便
- Humans are disgusting.- OK, you. Check for poop.

211
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,040
嘿，凭什么让我检查？因为是你要送他回去
- Why am I the poop-checker?- Returning him was your idea,

212
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,610
因为你无足轻重因为你不检查我就揍你
you're small and insignificant,and I'll pummel you if you don't.

213
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,210
还有吗？快！希德！
- Why else?- Now, Sid.

214
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,030
唷！哎哟我的妈呀好了，小心，小心，过来了
I mean, my goodness.Look out. Coming through.

215
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,950
嘿，小心！别拿它晃来晃去的！
- Watch out.- Stop waving that thing around.

216
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,830
呜，我要滑倒了，啊
I'm gonna slip.

217
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,540
是干净的，你上当了
It's clean. Got ya!

218
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,840
别胡闹行吗？
Will you cut it out?

219
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,540
嘿，再来，他喜欢
Do that again. He likes it.

220
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,780
我也觉得爽多了
It's making me feel better too.

221
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,050
给，你来抱
Here, you hold it.

222
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,300
行了，让他脸朝我
Turn him towards me.

223
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,830
宝宝在哪儿？
Where is the baby?

224
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,070
他在这儿！
There he is.

225
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,970
宝宝在哪儿？
Where is the baby?

226
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,670
他在这儿！
There he is.

227
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,300
行了！你吓坏他了！
Stop it. You're scaring him.

228
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,910
他一定是饿了该吃奶了
- I bet he's hungry.- How about some milk?

229
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,050
噢，我爱吃奶！不是你吃！是孩子吃！
- I'd love some.- Not you. The baby.

230
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,760
我可没有奶水给他喝，伙计
I aingt exactly lactating right now, pal.

231
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,630
你这食物链底层的没资格顶嘴
- You're a little low on the food chain to...

232
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,230
够了！够了！够了！
Enough, enough, enough.

233
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,830
有吃的！
Food.

234
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,740
我不知道，可我听说
I don't know, but I've been told

235
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,910
我不知道，可我听说
I don't know, but I've been told

236
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,920
世界末日会很冷
End of the world be mighty cold

237
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,150
世界末日会很冷
End of the world be mighty cold

238
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,050
为冰川时代作准备！
Prepare for the lce age!

239
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,650
保护渡渡鸟的生活方式！
Protect the dodo way of life!

240
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,020
渡渡鸟的生存能力胜过其他动物！
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

241
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,700
保护渡渡鸟的生活方式！
Protect the dodo way of life!

242
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,030
为冰川时代做准备！
Prepare for the lce age!

243
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,200
冰川时代？我听说过这些疯子
- lce age?- I've heard of these crackpots.

244
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,640
有闯入者！闯入者！别掉进去
- lntruders.- Now, don't fall in.

245
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,740
掉进去，就一定会…有闯…闯入者，闯入…哇！
- If you do, you will definitely...- lntruders. Intruder...

246
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
被烫死了
..burn and die.

247
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,750
能把西瓜给我们吗？小家伙饿坏了，他…
Can we have our melon back?Junior's hungry and...

248
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,130
不行！这是我们为冰川时代存下的储备！
No way. This is our privatestockpile for the lce age.

249
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,360
到那个时候我们就要在地下住好几十亿年呢！
Subarctic temperatures will force us underground for a billion years.

250
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,560
只存三只西瓜？
So you got three melons?

251
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,100
如果你们事先不好好作准备那就死定了！
If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead, then doom on you.

252
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,870
死定了，死定了，死定了
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

253
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,070
别过来
- Get away from me.- Doom on you.

254
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,150
哦，不，不
Oh, no. No.

255
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,110
夺回那西瓜！跆…跆拳道准备！进攻！
Retrieve the melon.Tae kwon dodos, attack.

256
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,830
西瓜！
- The melon.- The melon, the melon, the melon...

257
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,470
最后一个“女同胞”也完了
There goes our last female.

258
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,540
抢到了，抢到了，抢到了又没了！
- Got it, got it, got it.- Don't got it.

259
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,010
最后的西瓜
The last melon.

260
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,840
啊，希德！还得再找吃的了！
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

261
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,180
再往右一点！
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

262
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,950
嘿，晚餐还有表演看不，左，左，左，不
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.- Left, left, left.

263
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,920
现在该找份象样的大餐犒劳胜利英雄了
Now to find a meal befitting a conquering hero.

264
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,860
是什么？敌人？来吧，想跟我干一架吗？
What ho? A foe? Come on,come on. You want a piece of me?

265
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,570
这战利品值得我为它好好…
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

266
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,780
该睡了，小鬼
Bedtime, squirt.

267
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,900
噢，凯旋归来了
The triumphant return.

268
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,270
呃？噢，那是
Huh? Oh, that.

269
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,760
呃…我吃饱了该亲亲这个小朋友说晚安了
I'm so full. How about a good-night kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

270

And he's happy.Look, he's playing with his kid.

409
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,420
瞧,曼尼,这就是你的问题毛象应该象他们那样
See? That's your problem.That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

410
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,150
找头母象…生一头毛象宝宝
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

411
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,010
希德
- Sid.

412
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,460
干嘛?闭嘴
- What?- Shut up.

413
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,160
可…噢
But...

414
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,470
噢,快瞧啊
Would you look at that.

415
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,600
老虎没带错路这是“半峰山”
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

416
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,410
下一站,冰川道
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

417
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,600
我真不该怀疑你你听见吗,小家伙?
- How could I ever have doubted you?- Did you hear that, little fella?

418
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,780
你快到家了
You're almost home.

419
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:20,020
我的脚在冒汗你身体每出现一个反应
- My feet are sweating.- Do we need a news flash

420
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,480
我们都得发布新闻?他要我们注意他
- every time your body does something?- lgnore him.

421
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,790
是真的我的脚真的很烫!噢,噢
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

422
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,840
是你的肚子在叫吧?
Tell me that was your stomach.

423
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,170
嘘,我肯定是那是雷声
I'm sure it was just thunder.

424
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,370
声音…来自…地下?
From underground?

425
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,760
快,跟我一起跑
Come on, keep up with me.

426
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,630
可你原地不动!
I would if you were moving.

427
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,210
哇,但愿我也能跳成全你了!
- I wish I could jump like that.- Wish granted.

428
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,970
快!跑快点!难道你没看到熔岩流吗?
- Come on, move faster.- Have you noticed the river of lava?

429
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,270
抱紧他!
Hold Pinky.

430
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,900
曼尼
Manny.

431
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:31,020
曼尼,你没事吧?求你说点什么,什么都行
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

432
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,490
什么?什么?我听不清
What? What? I can't hear you.

433
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,890
你站在我的鼻子上了
You're standing on my trunk.

434
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:43,390
啊,你没事!你没事你为什么那么干?
- You're OK. You're OK.- Why did you do that?

435
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,230
你冒死…救了我的命
You could have died, trying to save me.

436
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,230
大家是一个集体
That's what you do in a herd.

437
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,470
得互相照顾
You look out for each other.

438
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,980
噢!谢谢
Well, thanks.

439
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,640
不知你们怎么想,可我觉得我们这“集体”是最怪的
I don't know about you guys,but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

440
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,070
我的爪子都快等不及要撕烂那毛象了!
I can't wait to getmy claws in that mammoth.

441
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,960
谁都不能碰那毛象除非我先得到…孩子!
No one touches the mammoth until I get that baby.

442
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,010
首先,我要把那毛象撕开扯烂
First, I'll slice its hindquarters into sections.

443
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:36,280
把白色肉放一堆,深色…嘿,别再说了!我饿坏了!
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...- Knock it off. I'm starving.

444
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:40,090
肩膀的肉…可能比较老但绝对多汁
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy.

445
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:43,390
警告过你了,别再说了!省点力气吧!
- I told you to knock it off.- Save your energy.

446
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,490
要杀毛象谈何容易
Mammoths don't go down easy.

447
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,060
只有一个办法
There's only one way to do it.

448
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,760
首先,得把他逼上死角
First, you have to force it into a corner.

449
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:56,430
切断他的退路等你们三个把他困住
Cut off its retreat.And when you three have it trapped,

450
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,800
我就咬断他的喉咙
I'll go for the throat.

451
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,520
伙计们,别让孩子吹着风!
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

452
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,060
还有多远?三英里
- How much further?- Three miles.

453
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,550
我累坏了,我们早上能到
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

454
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,330
你在干嘛?我让树懒…名垂千古
- What are you doing?- I'm putting sloths on the map.

455
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,410
那得画得现实点画他在睡觉
Why don't you make it realistic and draw him lying down?

456
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,570
画得“圆”一些
And make him rounder.

457
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,870
好极了哈!我真笑不出来
- Perfect.- I forgot how to laugh.

458
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,390
我是个天才
I'm a genius.

459
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:00,960
从现在起,你们得称呼我“希德-火焰之王”
From now on you'll have torefer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

460
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,600
嘿,火焰之王,你尾巴着火了
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

461
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,610
噢,谢谢,从现在起我就管你叫…“迭戈”
Thank you. From now on,I'm gonna call you Diego.

462
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,020
“摸我你是死定之王”
Lord of "Touch Me and You're Dead".

463
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,250
我是说着玩的你这没头脑的
I'm just kidding, you little knucklehead.

464
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,990
嘿,小俩口
Lovebirds.

465
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,190
快瞧
Look at this.

466
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,200
这简直……太神了
I don't believe it.

467
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:51,650
过来,小家伙过来,你这小虫虫
Come here, you little biped.Come here, you little wormy-worm.

468
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,950
到希德叔叔这儿来
Come to Uncle Sid.

469
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,090
这边,这边
No, no... This way. This way.

470
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,830
不,去他那儿
No, no, no. No, go to him.

471
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,030
去他那儿
Go to him.

472
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,740
好吧
OK.

473
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,810
干得好,接着…练习吧
Good job. Keep practicing.

474
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,950
快瞧啊,我们的小家伙在长大
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

475
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,250
好了,过来该睡了,肉团儿
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

476
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,990
他对孩子就是亲
Look at that big pushover.

477
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,920
要知道,迭戈我还没有能冒死救我的朋友呢
You know, Diego, I've never hada friend who would risk his life for me.

478
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:42,700
是啊,曼尼他…他真好
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

479
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,200
是啊,的确
Yeah, he is.

480
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,370
好了,晚安
Well, good night.

481
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:26,010
让我给你弄干净,你这么又脏又臭的回去,你老爸会怎么说?
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

482
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:30,910
我来擦干净,嗯,好多了这儿还有点儿
Let me just clean that up.That looks good. A little bit here.

483
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,850
擦干净真漂亮,小家伙他长得越来越象我了
- You clean up nice, little fella.- I think he's starting to look like me.

484
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,060
嘿,迭戈,你说呢?
Diego, what do you think?

485
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,120
也许不该送回去为什么?
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.- Why not?

486
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:45,020
因为他长大后会成为猎人你说他会猎杀谁?
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.And who do you think he'll hunt?

487
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,630
也许救了他他就不会成猎人
Maybe because we save him,he won't hunt us.

488
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,300
是啊,也许他会长出毛和长脖然叫你“妈妈”
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur anda long skinny neck and call you Mama.

489
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,240
你怎么回事?没什么,我们走,冻死我了
- What's your problem?- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

490
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,660
嘿,迭戈,你被冻住了吗?
Diego. You frozen back there?

491
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,970
低下身子!什么?
- Get down.- What?

492
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,310
嘘,低下身跟我走嘿,怎么回事?
- Get down and follow me.- What's going on?

493
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:33,440
在半峰山脚下有个埋伏…等着你们
At the bottom of Half Peak,there's an ambush waiting for you.

494
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,850
什么?你说什么“埋伏”?
- What?- What do you mean, "ambush"?

495
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,220
你设了圈套!那是我的任务!
- You set us up.- It was my job.

496
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:43,890
我得把孩子抢到手,可是你把我们带回家当晚餐
- I was to get the baby, but then...- You brought us home for dinner.

497
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,800
行了!你被开除了!真对不起
- That's it. You're out of the herd.- I'm sorry.

498
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,930
我宰了你…你再后悔吧
No, you're not. Not yet.

499
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,830
听着,我能帮你们跟紧了,希德,我们能杀出去!
- Listen, I can help you.- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

500
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,200
不行!他们太强大了你们得信任我
You can't. The pack's too strong.You have to trust me.

501
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,540
信任你?我们干嘛要信任你?
Trust you? Why in the world would we trust you?

502
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,640
因为你们只有靠我
Because I'm your only chance.

503
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,350
哈罗,“小姐”们
Hello, ladies.

504
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,690
嘿,瞧谁终于肯露脸了迭戈,我正为你担心呢
- Look who decided to show up.- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

505
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:30,030
用不着担心,再过两分钟你将从…复仇中…得到满足
No need to worry. In about two minutesyou'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

506
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,870
这非常好
Very nice.

507
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,370
我看见树懒了!孩子在他手里!
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

508
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:40,810
没见到毛象就别暴露你们自己我们得出其不意
Don't give away your positions until yousee the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

509
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,550
你想重拳出击对吗,齐克?
You want to maul something, don't you?

510
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:48,120
呵呵,我想出击那你还等什么?
- I wanna maul.- Then what are you waiting for?

511
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,830
不,我说了等那毛象出现!
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

512
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,950
“雪板挠背”你们吃白雪吧!嘿嘿
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

513
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,670
唷!喔!“环滑车”呃,啊!
Loop-de-loop.

514
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,840
障碍滑雪,障碍滑雪，宝贝
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

515
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,330
对不起,伙计们他被冻成小雪人了
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

516
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,040
呜!宰了他!
Get him.

517
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,140
大惊喜!
Surprise!

518
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:27,760
好吧,跟我来!我们去找希德,然后离开这儿
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sidand get outta here while we can.

519
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,790
来吧,迭戈我们把这毛象摆平
Come on, Diego,let's bring this mammoth down.

520
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,480
他在这儿
There he is.

521
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,010
没错,宝宝在哪儿啊?
That's right. Where's the baby?

522
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:58,190
这就叫…适者…生存!
Survival of the fittest.

523
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,210
这老虎不行
I don't think so. Yeah.

524
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,770
你这是干嘛?不许…碰这…毛象
- What are you doing?- Leave the mammoth alone.

525
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,740
好,我先把你摆平
Fine. I'll take you down first.

526
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,780
我们赢了
We did it.

527
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,270
我们曾经是多棒的集体
We were some team, huh?

528
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,370
曾经是?胡说,我们还是一个集体
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

529
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,340
我设下圈套,真对不起
I'm sorry I set you up.

530
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,710
我就算恨你,也懒得记仇了
You know me -I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

531
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,150
嘿,别闹,小鬼
Knock it off, squirt.

532
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,120
你得强壮些
You gotta be strong.

533
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,790
你得照顾曼福雷德和希德
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

534
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,820
尤其是希德
Especially Sid.

535
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:25,790
行了,你能挺过来,你是老虎
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

536
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:29,000
我能背你,你说怎么样?
Look, I'll carry you.Come on, what do you say?

537
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,410
振作点,迭戈,振作!
Come on, Diego, come on.

538
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,640
告诉他他会好的,曼尼
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

539
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,880
听着,你们别管我了
Listen, you have to leave me here.

540
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:43,180
如果人类过了“冰川道”你们就找不到他们了
If those humans get through the pass,you'll never catch them.

541
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,880
你不用救我的
You didn't have to do that.

542
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,760
我们是一个集体
That's what you do in a herd.

543
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,580
别忘了我们
Don't forget about us.

544
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,750
好吗?
OK?

545
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,690
我们不会忘了你
We won't forget about you.

546
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,030
再见,再见
Goodbye.

547
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,610
再见,再见
