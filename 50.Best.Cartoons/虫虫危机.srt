2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:10,260

3
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,000
不...
No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

4
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,250
我迷路了  路线呢?
I'm lost! Where's the line?

5
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,420
路线不见了  怎么办...?
It just went away. What do I do? What do I do?

6
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,380
救命啊  我们会永远困在这儿了
- Help! - We'll be stuck here forever!

7
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,220
不要慌...
Do not panic. Do not panic!

8
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,680
我们是受过训的专家  现在保持冷静
We are trained professionals. Now, stay calm.

9
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,930
我们要绕过叶子走
We are going around the leaf.

10
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,850
绕...绕过叶子?   我...我想我们办不到
A...Around the leaf? I...I don't think we can do that.

11
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,900
哦   胡说八道  这跟93年树枝事件相比根本没什么
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing compared to the twig of'93.

12
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,150
就是这样...
That's it. That's it. Good!

13
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,410
很好  你做的很好  就是这样  再继续
You're doing great! There you go. There you go!

14
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,740
看着我的眼睛  不要看别处
Watch my eyes. Don't look away.

15
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,750
路线就在这里了  谢谢  谢谢  索尼先生
- And here's the line again. - Thank you. Thank you, Mr Soil.

16
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,790
哈...大伙儿  干的好
Good job, everybody!

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,380
天哪  索尼先生  刚刚的缺口可真大
Oh, my. There's quite a gap, Mr Soil.

18
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,840
要不要告诉皇后啊?   我想不必拿这件事情让皇后烦心
- Shouldn't we tell the queen? - I don't think we need to involve the queen in this.

19
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,550
她最近已经够忙的了  训练她的女儿
She's got enough on her plate already, training her daughter.

20
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,470
没错  雅婷公主  那可怜的孩子
Oh, yes. Princess Atta, the poor dear.

21
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,390
风变弱了  他们马上就会到了
Oh, wind's died down. They'll be here soon.

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,270
亲爱的  要有信心  不会有事的  那里有个缺口
- Just be confident, dear. You'll be fine. - There's a gap.

23
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,770
队伍里有个缺口  我们要怎么办?
There's a gap in the line. What are we gonna do?

24
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,940
没关系的  公主殿下  缺口常会有  我们只相差几寸而已
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen. We just lost a few inches, that's all.

25
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,990
哦  对...
Oh. Right.

26
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,990
公主殿下  你这样盘旋我没办法数数了
Your Highness, I can't count when you hover like that.

27
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,990
哦  对不起  你继续
Oh, of course. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,580
好了  先去替别人遮阴吧
Guys, go shade someone else for a while.

29
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,790
雅婷  你说  现在要做什么呢?
Okay, Atta. Now what do we do?

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,170
呃...别告诉我  我知道...是什么呢
Uh... Oh! Don't tell me. I know it. I know it. What is it?

31
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,670
我们放轻松  对
- We relax. - Right.

32
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,130
放心吧   每年都是一样的
Oh, it'll be fine. It's the same, year after year.

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,470
他们来  他们吃  他们走  这就是我们的命运
They come, they eat, they leave. That's our lot in life.

34
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,430
虽然苦  还是得过呀
It's not a lot, but it's our life.

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,640
哈...对不对啊  蚜蚜?   你真是个可爱的小蚜虫
Isn't that right, Aphie? Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

36
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,520
快  甩掉小不点  耶
- Ditch Dot! - Yeah, yeah!

37
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,900
嘿  你们回来啊
Hey, come back here!

38
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,780
小不点  什么事  妈妈?
- Dot! - Yes, Mother.

39
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,450
我是怎么跟你说飞行的事的?
What did I tell you about trying to fly?

40
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,910
翅膀长好以后才能飞
Not until my wings grow in.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,870
对  妈...
- Right. - But, Mom...

42
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,660
小不点  你还小  而且你的翅膀还没长好啊
Dot, you're a young queen ant, and your wings are too little to be...

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,380
我是在跟妈说话  你还不是皇后  雅婷
I was talking to Mother. You're not the queen yet, Atta.

44
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,880
小不点  不要跟你姐姐顶嘴哦
Now, Dot, be nice to your sister.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,260
谁叫她老爱大惊小怪的
It's not my fault she's so stressed out.

46
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,420
我知道...
I know, I know.

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,720
我的表现像是天要塌下来似的  小心啊
- I'm always acting like the sky is falling. - Look out!

48
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,470
雅婷  雅婷公主...
- Atta! - Princess Atta! Princess Atta! - Princess Atta!

49
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,540
快住手  你在干嘛?
- Stop that! - What do you think you're doing?

50
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,910
这样会出人命的  对不起...
- You could have killed somebody over here. - I'm sorry!

51
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,880
对不起...  哦  是飞力啊
- I'm sorry! - Oh, it's Flik.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,090
对不起...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

53
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,210
请原谅我  对不起
Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

54
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,840
雅婷公主  飞力  你在干什么啊?
- Princess Atta! - Flik, what are you doing?

55
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,260
哦  这个啊  这是我收割谷粒的新点子啊
Oh! Oh, this! This is my new idea for harvesting grain.

56
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,760
再也不必采摘一谷一谷的谷子  可以砍断整根茎干
No more picking individual kernels. You can just cut down the entire stalk!

57
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,840
飞力  我们没时间听这些
- Flik, we don't have time for this.

58
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,440
没错  我们从来没有时间为自己收集食物
- Exactly! We never have time to collect food for ourselves.

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,600
因为整个夏天  都在为贡品做准备
Because we spend all summer harvesting for the offering.

60
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,440
但是我的发明可以加速生产  噢  又一个新发明?
- But my invention will speed up production. - Oh, another invention?

61
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,690
对  我也有东西要给你  飞力
- Yeah, and I've got something for you too. - Flik!

62
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,200
既然你很快就会当皇后 你可以用这个来监督进度啊
Since you're gonna be queen, you could use this to oversee production.

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,660
萝拉医生  借用一下  这一切都很好...  好什么?
- Dr Flora, if I may. - This is all very nice, but... - What?

64
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,160
但是...飞力你 只是一根草和一颗小露珠  对吧?   飞力  拜托...
- Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right? - Flik, please.

65
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,120
错了  其实它是一个望远镜
Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.

66
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,930
这非常聪明  但是...
- It's very clever, Flik, but...

67
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,460
公主  你好  天啊   你今天早上看起来真可爱
- Hello, Princess! My, aren't you looking lovely this morning!

68
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,260
不过当然啦 不必用望远镜也看得出来
Not, of course, that you would need a telescope to see that.

69
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,090
好了  听着  公主没时间听这些事情
All right, listen! The princess doesn't have time for this!

70
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,260
你要帮我们完成这任务  那么就丢掉那机器...
You wanna help us fill this thing? Then get rid of that machine...

71
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,810
回到队伍里并且像其他蚂蚁一样收割谷谷
get back in line and pick grain like everybody else!

72
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,980
像其他蚂蚁一样啊  拜托  飞力  走吧
- Like everybody else! - Please, Flik. Just go.

73
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,230
对不起  我只是想要...
I'm sorry,I was... I was really just trying...

74
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,190
想要帮忙
trying to help.

75
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,990
什么收割机嘛  从我还是蛹的时候我们就这样收割了
Harvester. Why, we harvested the same way ever since I was a pupa.

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,410
刚刚说到哪儿了?
Where were we?

77
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,660
呃  贡品  公主殿下  哦  对...
- The food pile, Your Highness. - Oh, yes, yes.

78
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,330
嘿  飞力  飞力  等等我
Hey, Flik! Flik! Wait up!

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,050
哦  你好  小公主  叫我小不点吧  来  你忘了这个
- Oh. Hello, Princess. - You can call me Dot. Here, you forgot this.

80
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,800
谢了  你留着吧  我可以再做一个
Thanks. You can keep it. I can make another one.

81
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,260
我很喜欢你的发明耶  真的?  你倒还是第一个
- I like your inventions. - Really? Well, you're the first.

82
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,430
我还以为我做的一切都不管用  这很有用
- I'm beginning to think nothing I do works. - This works.

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,230
好极了  至少有一个成功
Great. One success.

84
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,100
但我永远成不了大事  我也一样
- I'm never gonna make a difference. - Me, neither.

85
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,020
我居然连飞都不会飞耶  我太小了
I'm a royal ant, and I can't even fly yet. I'm too little.

86
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,980
哦  小并没有那么糟糕  它就有
- Oh, being little's not such a bad thing. - Yes, it is.

87
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,490
不  它没有  有...
- No, it's not. - Is too!

88
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,610
没有...  有...
- Is not. - Is too. - Is not. - Is too.

89
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,870
没有...  有...
- Is not. Is not. Is not. Oh! - Is too. Is too. Is too.

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,830
种子  我需要一个种子
A seed. I need... I need a seed. Ahh...

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,460
好吧
Ah, here, here.

92
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,920
假装...假装它是个种子
Pretend... pretend that that's a seed.

93
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,130
这是石头  这是石头我知道
- It's a rock. - Oh, I know it's a rock. I know.

94
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,930
但是我们先假装一下它是种子好吗?  发挥你的想像力
But let's just pretend for a minute that it's a seed, all right? We'll just use our imaginations.

95
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,890
你有没有看到那棵树?
Now... Now, do you see our tree?

96
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,180
它能够长成一棵很大的大树
Everything that made that giant tree...

97
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,600
都是因为呀有这么一颗小小的种子
is already contained inside this tiny little seed.

98
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,770
它只需要一点点时间 一点点阳光  雨水
All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and...

99
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,820
然后就变成大树啦
voilà!

100
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,190
这石头  它会变成大树?
This rock will be a tree?

101
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,860
种子变成树  你得专心听好吗?
Seed to tree. You've gotta work with me, all right? Okay.

102
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,120
好  你现在 也许觉得做不了什么
You might not feel like you can do much now...

103
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,660
那只是因为  你还不是棵大树
but that's just because, well, you're not a tree yet.

104
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,710
你必须给自己一点时间  你还是个种子
You just have to give yourself some time. You're still a seed.

105
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,040
这是石头  我知道这是石头
- But it's a rock. - I know it's a rock!

106
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,580
我看到石头的时候  会不知道它是石头吗?
Don't ya think I know a rock when I see a rock?

107
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,210
我这一生都耗在石头堆里工作
I've spent a lot of time around rocks!

108
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,130
你好奇怪喔  但我喜欢你
You're weird, but I like you.

109
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,010
他们来了
They're here.

110
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,810
他们来了
They're here!

111
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,020
快跑...妈  你在哪?
Mom! Where are you?

112
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,110
他们来了  快跑
- They're coming! - Run!

113
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,910
小不点...  妈  大家快成单线纵队...
- Dot! Dot! - Mom! - Single file!

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
妈  谢天谢地
- Mom! - Thank heavens!

115
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,750
快把食物放在贡品石头上  好  所有人单线纵队
- Food to the offering stone. - Okay, everyone, single file.

116
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,460
把食物送到石头上 然后躲进蚁穴  快一点
Food to the offering stone and into the anthill. Now let's go!

117
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,710
快...
Go, go, go, go!

118
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,950
快...动作快...
Come on. Keep movin', keep movin'! Good.

119
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,370
很好  大家都到了
Okay. That's everyone.

120
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,380
嘿  等等我
Hey! Hey, wait for me!

121
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,630
把食物送到贡品石头上  然后躲进蚁穴
Get the food to the offering stone, then into the anthill.

122
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,820
不...
No! No, no, no, no, no! Oh, oh!

123
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,000
哦  不
Oh, no.

124
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,960
雅婷公主...
Princess Atta! Princess Atta!

125
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,540
雅婷公主
Princess Atta!

126
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,390
他们来  他们吃  他们走
They come, they eat, they leave. They come, they eat, they leave.

127
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,620
抱歉...
Excuse me, pardon me. Pardon me, excuse me.

128
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,810
借过...
Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me.

129
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,520
抱歉...借过...  雅婷公主  我必须告诉你一件事情
Sorry, sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta, there's something I need to tell you.

130
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,610
等一下  飞力  但是公主  这跟贡品有关啊
- Not now, Flik. - But, Your Highness, it's about the offering!

131
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,070
喂  这怎么回事啊?  是啊  食物在哪?
- Hey, what's goin' on? - Yeah, where's the food?

132
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,540
你做了什么好事?  那是个意外
- What did you do? - It was an accident?

133
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,970
食物在哪?
Where's the food? Huh?

134
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,280
霸...霸王
Hopper.

135
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,270
食物在哪里?
So, where is it?

136
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,850
我的食物在哪?
Where's my food?

137
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,820
没...没在上面吗?  什么?
- I...Isn't it up there? - What?

138
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,360
那些食物就堆在一片叶...  你说什么?
- The food was in a leaf sitting on top... - Excuse me.

139
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,450
你确定食物不在上面...
Are you sure it's not up there?

140
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,660
你是说我像笨蛋?   不
- Are you saying I'm stupid? - No.

141
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,740
你是说...我看起来像笨蛋?
Do I look stupid to you?

142
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,250
我们来想想这个逻辑好吗?  只要稍微想一想就行了
Let's just think about the logic, shall we? Let's just think about it for a second.

143
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,500
如果食物在上面  难道我还会自贬身价的
If it was up there, would I be coming down here...

144
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,460
跑到下面来找你们吗?
to your level, looking for it?

145
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,050
呃  我...  我干嘛要跟你说话?
- Uh, l... - Why am I even talking to you?

146
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,800
你又不是皇后  你闻起来也不像皇后
You're not the queen. You don't smell like the queen.

147
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,760
她...很快就会继承我了  霸王
Sh-She's learning to take over for me, Hopper.

148
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,970
哦  我懂了  新的管理阶层  所以这是你的错
Oh, I see. Under new management. So it's your fault.

149
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,730
不  不是我的错  而是...
No, it wasn't me. It was...

150
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,940
哦  哦  领导者的第一守则  所有一切都是你的错
Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership: Everything is your fault.

151
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,690
但是我... 外面是个虫吃虫的世界  公主
- But-But l... - It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess...

152
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,070
就像是食物链那一类的事情
one of those circle-of-life kind of things.

153
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,410
现在我来告诉你 事情是怎么运作的
Now, let me tell you how things are supposed to work.

154
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,540
阳光让食物生长  蚂蚁要采集食物
The sun grows the food. The ants pick the food.

155
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,460
而蚱蜢来吃光食物  而小鸟来吃掉蚱蜢
- The grasshoppers eat the food... - And the birds eat the grasshoppers.

156
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,840
就有一只差点 把你给吃掉了  你还记得吗?
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you, you remember? You remember?

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,210
你们真该看一看的  摩尔特
- Oh, you should've seen it. - Molt.

158
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,760
这只蓝鸟  已经把他吞掉一半了  然后霸王又踢又叫的
This blue jay... He has him halfway down his throat, okay? And Hopper... Hopper's kickin' and screamin', okay?

159
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,720
我可吓坏了 我才不要靠近咧
And I'm scared, okay? I'm not goin' anywhere near, okay?

160
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,760
拜托  精彩的还在后面呢
Aw, come on. It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

161
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,480
要不是我在老妈临终前
I swear, if I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed...

162
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,190
向她保证  我不杀你 你还能活到现在? 你白痴啊
that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you.

163
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,770
请相信我  没有人比我更感激这一点了  闭嘴
- And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do. - Shut up!

164
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,610
我在这个小岛的时候  不想再听到你开口
I don't want to hear another word out of you while we're on this island.

165
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,150
你给我听清楚没有?
Do you understand me?

166
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,870
我说  你听清楚没有?  你不准我开口  你叫我怎么回答?
- I said, do you understand me? - Well, how can I answer? You said I couldn't say another word.

167
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,160
耶...你答应过老妈的...
Remember Ma!

168
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,040
嘿  我可是有同情心的昆虫
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

169
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,670
还有几个月  雨季才会到
There's still a few months till the rains come...

170
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,180
所以我决定再给你们一次机会
so you can all just try again.

171
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,930
但是霸王  就是因为雨季快要到了
But, Hopper, since it's almost the rainy season...

172
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,560
我们需要这段时间 为自己收集食物啊
we need this time to gather food for ourselves.

173
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,390
听好  如果你们没办法达成我们的协议
Listen, if you don't keep your end of the bargain,

174
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,180
我就不能保证你们的安全
then I can't guarantee your safety.

175
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,150
外面可是有很多昆虫  会占你们的便宜的
And there are insects out there that will take advantage of you.

176
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,480
可能...会有人受伤
Someone could get hurt.

177
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,500
你怎么回事?  你是在怕蚱蜢吗?
What's the matter? You scared of grasshoppers?

178
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,460
小不点  你不喜欢山霸?
- Dot! - You don't like Thumper?

179
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,260
放开她
Leave her alone!

180
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,060
想救她? 来啊  来救啊
You want her? Go ahead. Take her.

181
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,320
不敢? 那就滚回你的队伍去
No? Then get back in line.

182
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,580
我觉得你们这些蚂蚁  已经忘记自己是什么东西
It seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place.

183
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,790
所以食物的份量以后要加倍
So let's double the order of food.

184
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,920
什么  不...
- Huh? - No! But-But-But...

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,300
我们会在这一季结束的时候再回来
We'll be back at the end of the season...

186
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,010
等最后一片...叶子掉落时
when the last leaf falls.

187
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,350
祝你们有个愉快的夏天  咱们飞
You ants have a nice summer. Let's ride!

188
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,040
飞力  你还有什么话好说?
Flik, what do you have to say for yourself?

189
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,800
抱歉  我很抱歉我那么做了
Sorry. L... I'm sorry for the way I am.

190
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,260
我不是故意要把事情搞砸的
I didn't mean for things to go so wrong.

191
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,300
我也不想让你觉得丢脸啊  公主
I especially didn't want to make you look bad, Princess.

192
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,680
但飞力  你做了  我只是想要帮忙
- Well, Flik, ya did. - I was just trying to help.

193
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,310
那就帮帮忙  不要帮我们
Then help us... don't help us.

194
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,310
帮忙? 帮忙  帮手?  飞力  我现在判你去挖一个月的通道
- Help? Help? Help? - Flik, you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels.

195
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,290
对不起啊   殿下  容我提醒您
Excuse me, Your Highness.

196
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,150
您忘了飞力上次闯的大祸了吗
Need I remind you of Flik's tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?

197
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,610
找帮手来帮忙  就是这样  我们可以...  ...两天时间
- Helpers to help us. That could... That's it! That's... We could... - It took the whole engineering department...

198
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,360
把他挖出来
two days to dig him out.

199
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,990
让他到健康服务队去  老天  不
- Send him to Health and Ant Services. - Heavens, no!

200
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,730
只要... 我们可以离开小岛
We could leave the island.

201
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,370
河床现在是干的  我们可以越过河床
The river bed's dry right now. We'd just walk right across the river bed.

202
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,120
...找帮手  我们...我们当然能够离开啦  找帮手来帮忙我们
We could go get helpers. We could! We could leave. Sure. We could go find helpers to help us.

203
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,290
太完美了  完美  什么很完美啊?
- It's perfect! - Perfect? What's so perfect?

204
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,630
殿下  难道你看不出来吗? 我们可以请人去找帮手啊
Your Highness, don't you see? We could send someone to get help!

205
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,710
离开这小岛?
Leave the island?

206
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,680
我怎么没想到这一点? 哦  因为这是在自杀
Now, why didn't I think of that? Oh! Because it's suicide!

207
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,050
皇后说的对  我们从来没离开过  绝不能离开
- She's right! We never leave the island. - Never leave!

208
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,720
外面有蛇  有鸟和更大的虫
There's snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there!

209
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,890
没有错  更大的虫
Exactly! Bigger bugs!

210
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,390
我们可以找更大的虫 来这里作战
We could find bigger bugs to come here and fight...

211
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,190
永远除掉那个霸王和他的党羽
and forever rid us of Hopper and his gang!

212
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,360
可笑  谁会愿意做这么疯狂的事情?
- Ludicrous! - Who would do a crazy thing like that?

213
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,150
我自愿  我很乐意自愿去找
I'll volunteer. I'd be very happy to volunteer.

214
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,820
哈...孩子  你真有胆量  但是没有人愿意帮一群蚂蚁的
You got a lot of spunk, kid, but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.

215
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,540
至少我们可以试试看啊  哦  我可以...
At least we could try. Oh, I...I could...

216
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,240
到大城市去  我可以在那里找
I could travel to the city! I could search there!

217
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,830
如果你去  得花上好几个星期
If you went, you'd be on that silly search for weeks.

218
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,960
皇室会商  公主  这是个好主意  非常的完美
- Royal huddle. - Great idea, Princess. It's perfect.

219
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,380
确实  等一下
- Exactly. - Wait a minute.

220
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,880
我刚说了什么啦? 先让飞力离开
- What did we just decide here? - To let Flik leave.

221
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,760
直到我们收割完  达到霸王的要求
While we keep harvesting to meet Hopper's demands.

222
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,260
你知道飞力不在  他就不会...  就不会给我们找麻烦
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't... - He can't mess anything up!

223
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,190
飞力  经过仔细的考虑  我们决定答应你的要求
Flik, after much deliberation, we have decided to grant you your request.

224
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,400
真的? 真的? 真的
- Really? - Really? - Uh, really.

225
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,480
谢谢你  公主  谢谢你给我这个机会
Oh, thank you, Princess. Thank you so much for this chance.

226
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,680
我保证不会让你失望的  好...很好  我保证
- I...I...I won't let you down, I promise, I promise, I promise.

227
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,610
没关系  真的没关系
- Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. No, forget it. Forget it.

228
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,330
但我最好在离开前  先修好我造成的破坏
- Oh, but I should probably help repair the damage before I go, don't you think?

229
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,780
不  不用了...你走吧
- No! No, no! Just go.

230
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,030
只管走吧  只管走吧
- Just go. - Just leave!

231
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,200
别担心  蚂蚁岛有救了
Don't worry! The colony is in good hands!

232
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,370
再见
Bye, now.

233
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,010
算了
All right.

234
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,970
嗨  各位  美好的一天  是吧?
Hey, fellas. Beautiful mornin', huh?

235
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,180
我爸爸说你离开小岛一个小时以后  就会哭着回来了
- My dad says he gives you 1 hour before you come back to the island crying.

236
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,190
是这样吗?
- Does he, now?

237
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,310
我爸不这么想  不是吗?
- My dad doesn't think that. - He doesn't, huh?

238
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,440
对  他说你会死定了  哦
- Now, he's bettin' you're gonna die. - Oh.

239
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,160
他说  如果你没被晒死  就是被鸟吃掉  我认为他会成功的
- Yeah, he says if the heat doesn't get ya, the birds will. - Well, I think he's gonna make it.

240
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,740
没人问你  你这个小矮子  是啊  小不点  你知道什么?
- Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness. - Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

241
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,120
嘿...别那么凶好不好?
Hey, hey, hey. Ease up, all right? Come on.

242
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,580
她也有权利发表她的意见啊
She's entitled to her opinion too.

243
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,760
你赶快走啊
So go, already.

244
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,600
嘿  城市在那边
- Hey! - The city's that way.

245
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,100
我知道  你应该是去找帮手  不是去找蒲公英
- I know. - You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions.

246
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,730
你们别烦他  他知道他在做什么
You leave him alone. He knows what he's doing.

247
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,860
对
That's right.

248
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,110
我要走了  为了蚁岛  也为了所有受压迫的蚂蚁们
Here I go. For the colony, and for oppressed ants everywhere!

249
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,250
嘿  再见  飞力
- Hey, hey, hey! - Bye, Flik!

250
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,850
祝你成功
Good luck, Flik!

251
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,940
再见
Bye! Whoa-oh!

252
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,230
飞力
Flik!

253
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,530
我没事
I'm okay!

254
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,650
你爸说的对  他死定了  你们等着瞧好了
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die. - You just watch.

255
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,410
他会找到你们所见过 最强最棒的虫虫
He's gonna get the bestest, roughest bugs you've ever seen!

256
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,120
退后  退后  退后点  你这可怕的野兽
Get back! Get back! Get back, you horrible beast!

257
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,580
我才不怕你呢
I have no fear!

258
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,380
哦  哦  我的天哪
- Ooh! - Oh, my goodness.

259
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,760
哦  不
Oh, no!

260
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,300
对不起  迪姆  好痛? 痛
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie? - Owie! Owie, owie.

261
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,100
来  告诉萝丝  那里痛  好了迪姆  乖乖不痛了
Please show Rosie the owie. All right, Dim. It's okay.

262
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,650
哼   我从来没有见过这么逊的表演
I have been in outhouses that didn't stink that bad.

263
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,400
什么跳蚤马戏团  真是烂透了
This is ridiculous. What a disappointment!

264
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,940
噢  不  你  过来  我要求退票
- Oh, no! - You! Come here! I want my money back!

265
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,780
开演两分钟就不能退票
Uh, no refunds after the first two minutes.

266
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,740
爆米花  馊爆米花
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!

267
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,740
我们观众都跑了  你们这些小丑上台表演
We're losin' the audience! You clowns get out there now!

268
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,040
我讨厌空着肚子上台表演  先表演
- I hate performing on an empty stomach! - Do your act, Heimlich.

269
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,080
然后才能吃  团长  有什么用啊?
- Then you can eat. - P.T., what's the point?

270
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:57,090
别闹了  阿竿  我们干嘛要上台去?  他们只会嘲笑我
- Not now, Slim. - What's the point of going out there? They'll only laugh at me.

271
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,260
因为你们本来就是小丑  不  那是因为我只是道具
- That's because you're a clown! - No, it's because I'm a prop!

272
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,970
你老是把我当成了扫帚  竿子  棍子  或者是竹竿
You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick, a splinter.

273
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,390
你是一只竹节虫  这样好玩
You're a walking stick. It's funny!

274
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,770
上台  你这个寄生虫
- Now go! - You parasite.

275
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,490
啦啦啦...春天多美丽
Spring's in the air.

276
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,700
我是一朵花  一朵没话好说的花  有蜜蜂
And I'm a flower with nothing interesting to say. A bee!

277
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,120
我是一只可爱的小雄蜜蜂
I am a cute little bumblebee!

278
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,170
我来了
Here I come!

279
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,920
你们这些花  跑慢一点嘛
Slow down, you flowers!

280
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,710
玉米糖? 来  我帮你吃掉它
Candy corn! Here. Here. Let me help you to finish it.

281
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,930
嘿  美人儿  要让真的虫来传花粉吗?
Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate with a real bug?

282
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,600
他喜欢你喔
Ooh, come to Papa, yeah!

283
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,480
到我这来  身为瓢虫就一定是女性  是吗  苍蝇兄弟?
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes me a girl, is that it, fly boy? Huh?

284
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,020
什么  她是男的  法兰斯  不要理他们
- She's a guy! - Francis, leave them alone.

285
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,780
他们的手上有便便  别再闹了
- They are poo-poo heads! - Not again.

286
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,110
你们的嘴巴都那么臭  一定是吃了很多大便
Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.

287
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,580
好了  法兰斯 你要把那些蛆弄哭了
Come on, Francis. You're making the maggots cry.

288
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,750
好了  外面都快毁了  吉普赛  快点 你和曼尼立刻...
All right, we're dyin' out there. Gypsy, quick! You and Manny...

289
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,790
他在催眠状态
He's in a trance.

290
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,510
快把他弄醒  你跟你老公立刻上台  曼尼  该上台了
- Well, get him out of it! You and your husband are up now. - Manny, we're on.

291
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,430
又提早上  又要靠我来救这些表演者
Oh? Yet again it is up to me to rescue the performance.

292
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,430
吉普赛  来吧
Gypsy, come.

293
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,350
舞台在另外一边  老公  我知道了
- The stage is the other way, dear. - Yes, of course.

294
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,810
随时候教  老兄  我会把你的头发一根一根拔光
Anytime, pal! I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one!

295
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,400
你尽管出招吧  地点随你挑
- Take your best shot! - You name the place!

296
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,150
哦  是吗? 只要你敢来  你就死定了
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah, 'cause when you get there, you are dead!

297
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,420
法兰斯  让我来应付  对小姐不能这么没礼貌
- Francis, let me handle this. That's no way to speak to a lady.

298
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,700
我听到了  瘦竹竿
- I heard that, you twig.

299
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,370
嘿  各位先生女士  现在向你们介绍  伟大的魔术师曼尼
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Manto the Magnificent...

300
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,420
和他可爱的助手吉普赛
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!

301
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,300
来自亚洲最神秘的地区  没有人烟的地方
From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia...

302
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,760
我发现了一个宝物
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...

303
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,760
那就是中国的百变箱
of Metamorphosis!

304
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,180
萝丝  叫所有人都上台  快结束了  快

Coming. Coming. Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys. We're up next.

307
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,270
你们不懂吗  换我们上了
Don't you understand? We are up!

308
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,030
嘿   嘿  他们听不懂我的话
- Hey! - Hey! They don't understand me.

309
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,320
我要召唤孔老夫子
I summon the voice of Confucius...

310
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,830
你这江湖术士  快滚下台
Get off the stage, you old hack!

311
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,080
江湖术士...是谁说的?
I demand to know who said that!

312
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,580
你好大的胆子
How dare you!

313
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,420
无耻之徒
Ingrates!

314
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,590
曼尼? 曼尼?
Manny? Manny!

315
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,850
我只剩下24小时可活  我可不想浪费在这儿
I only got 24 hours to live, and I ain't gonna waste it here.

316
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,850
走吧
Come on.

317
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,730
我已经受够这群没用的砘
I've just about had it with these losers!

318
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,940
死亡的火焰
Flaming death!

319
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,070
现在我手上拿的是一根火柴
I hold in my hand the match...

320
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,530
就在今天晚上决定  这两只虫的生死
the match that decides whether two bugs live or die this very evening.

321
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,410
等一下  我将会点燃这一排火柴
In a moment, I will light this trail of matches...

322
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,250
直接烧到一张捕蝇纸  捕蝇纸上充满了汽油
leading to a sheet of flypaper dowsed in lighter fluid!

323
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,790
被瞄准射向捕蝇纸的是阿德和阿乐
Aimed directly at the flypaper are Tuck and Roll...

324
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,420
他们是甲壳虫炮弹
the pill bug cannonballs!

325
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,800
要启动大炮的是迪姆  他被训练一听到铃声就跳
The cannon will be triggered by Dim, trained to jump at the sound of this bell...

326
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,140
时间设定在15秒钟后发射
set to go off in 15 seconds.

327
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,850
我们这些小甲壳虫
Our pill bugs' only hope of survival is...

328
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,810
唯一的生机就是高空蜘蛛小姐  萝丝
our mistress of the high wire, Rosie!

329
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,520
萝丝绑在正确长度的网线上
Secured to a web line of exact length...

330
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,690
她会掉在两根柱子中间
Rosie will plummet down to these two posts...

331
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,150
在15秒钟内织出一个安全网  接住那两只甲壳虫
spinning a web of safety in less than 15 seconds!

332
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,160
这样还不够刺激吗? 如果把他们通通
Not good enough, you say? Well, what if they were all...

333
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,160
蒙上眼睛呢?
blindfolded!

334
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,790
各位先生女士  我要建议
Ladies and gentlemen, may I suggest that those of you...

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,920
结构较虚弱的观众离场
with weak constitutions leave the arena...

336
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,720
这个表演非常的危险
for this act is so dangerous...

337
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,300
只要出一点差错...
that if the slightest thing should go wrong...

338
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,600
不  糟糕开始了吗  我刚才没听到

Get me outta here!

344
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,350
都怪我太紧张了  你们全被开除了
- It's the web. I'm sorry. It's... - You're all fired.

345
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,770
水弄来  团长  我们来了  我们会救你
- We got the water! - Here we come, P. T! - We'll save you.

不  哈利  不要看那个灯
No, Harry, no! Don't look at the light!

348
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,670
我控制不住  那灯好漂亮
I can't help it! It's so beautiful!

349
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,680
千万不要像个乡巴佬
Try not to look like a country bug.

350
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,510
融入  融入他们
Blend... blend in.

351
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
嘿  小臭虫...
Hey, buggy!

352
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,940
别叫他  他身上可能有跳蚤
What do you expect? The guy's a tick.

353
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,110
哇  城市
Wow! The city!

354
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,470
这班巴士会经过的站牌包括  化粪池
Making all stops to the septic tank, including standing water...

355
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,180
空的罐头  还有...老鼠
empty bean can and dead rat.

356
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,470
小心你的刺  上车了  小心一点
- Watch your stingers. All aboard! - Whoa! - Hey, watch it.

- Watch where you're goin'! - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean...

359
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,020
对不起
Oh, sorry!

360
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,650

我刚刚被人家撞了一下
That was an-an-an ac-ac-accident.

362
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,950
放开我的翅膀  我让你见识谁才狠

被跳蚤开除  我真丢脸啊
Fired by a flea... how humiliating!

377
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,420
我们真是逊毙了
Let's face it: We stink.

378
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,380
你被开除了...
You fired!  You fired! You fired!

I can't believe the troupe is breaking up. We've always been together.

我想...这不管用啊
Me thinketh it's not working!

407
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,980
撤回森林  赶快撤
Back to Sherwood Forest!

408
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,980

Oh, great ones! I have been scouting for bugs with your exact talents!

412
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,100
他是星探  我的家乡遇到了麻烦
- A talent scout. - My colony's in trouble.

413
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,020
有蚱蜢来欺压我们  我们被迫要准备一大堆的食物
Grasshoppers are coming! We've been forced to prepare all this food.

414
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,230
餐厅秀?   食物?
- Dinner theatre! - Food?

415
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
拜托  你们能够帮我们吗?
Please! Will you help us?

416
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,900
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

417
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,950
我们接受了  真的?   好耶  有工作

好了  各位来个精彩的演出了  哇  你们好勇猛喔
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg! - Whoa, you're vicious!

420
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,630
坐稳了  蚂蚁先生
Hold on, Mr Ant.

421
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:48,070
真不可思议  我好像在作梦一样耶
Amazing! This is too good to be true!

422
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,110
所以霸王会再回来啊  都是我的错
So, you see, it was my fault that Hopper's coming back.

423
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,330
但是雅婷公主呢  天啊  她太了不起了
But then, Princess Atta... boy, is she one in a million...

424
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,330
她让我出去找你们
she let me go out and find you.

425
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,370
我亲眼看到你们打败那些苍蝇
And after seeing you fight off those flies...

426
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,170
哇...那些蚱蜢啊   一定会大吃一惊的
Boy, are those grasshoppers in for a big surprise!

427
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,440
（知道他在说什么吗? ）

428
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,610
萝拉医生  天哪  别又病倒了
- Dr Flora! - Oh, dear. Not another one.

429
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,820
这太不公平了  对...不公平
- This is insane. - Insane.

430
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,160
这个岛上的食物就是不够
There's just not enough food left on the island!

431
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,950
霸王来之前  绝弄不到双倍食物的
No way we can make double quota before Hopper comes.

432
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,040
噢  贺利  我们还是得试  我们别无选择啊
Well, we have to try, Thorny. We don't have any choice.

- The name is Dot. - Well, Spot, you still lookin' for Flik?

436
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,390
算了吧  小污点  那砘锸蔷对回不来的
Forget it, Dot. That loser's never coming back.

437
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,930
飞力  他回来了...
Flik! He did it! He did it!

438
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,810

What? Quit shoving!

439
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,740
就是这儿了  这里就是蚂蚁岛
This is it! This is Ant Island!

440
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,620
飞力  我在这  飞力...

他成功了  好酷喔
- He did it! - Cool!

443
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,080
照这叶子掉落的速度  我们将会需要奇迹
At the rate these leaves are dropping, we're gonna need a miracle.

444
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,460
没错  是要奇迹
That's right! We need a miracle!

445
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,260
快点逃命啊
Run for your lives!

446
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,450
看来我们的臭名 都传到这儿来了
Once again, our reputation precedes us.

447
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,120
嘿  大伙儿们  嘿  我回来了
Hey, everybody! Hey! I'm back!

飞力他回来了耶  他回来了?

453
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,270
而且还带了一些凶狠的昆虫
And he's accompanied by savage insects!

454
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,940
怎么会?  他根本不可能会找到帮手的
What? How? He wasn't supposed to actually find someone!

455
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,480
噢  你们赶快来看看这个  好棒
Oh, look at this. Look at this. This is great. Look.

456

- Oh, my ticker! - So, what are you supposed to be?

457
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,570
他是棍子  笨蛋  你用他来打虫
He's a stick, stupid. You hit bugs with him.

458
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,490
哦  这么说你就太小看我了  没错  就像这样
- Well, that's an oversimplification. - That's right, kids. Like this!

459
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,490
不  放我下来
No! Put me down! Ow!

哦  孩子们  他最怕痒了
Uh-oh. Kids, he's kinda ticklish.

462
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,840
来  来  出来出来  小心点
Let's come on out. Careful.

463
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,930
噢  孩子  你成功了

- Atta, Atta! Did you see that really big bug over there? - He looks absolutely ferocious!

不不不  等等  可是事情不应该是这样的啊
No-no-no-no, wait! This was not supposed to happen.

471
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,040
我们原先希望他出去就... 危险  我们又要失业了
Mayday, Mayday. We're losin' the job.

472
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,000
我们不可能和蚱蜢作战的
We don't fight grasshoppers.

473
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,920
我们不用  但他们可以啊  没错

We drew one of you dying because our teacher said it would be more dramatic.

496
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,290
我要说一个有关勇敢英雄的故事
I tell you a tale of heroes so bold...

Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for all of this, but, well, that wouldn't be right.

公主  这些战士要求 召开秘密会议来想把戏...
Your Highness, the warriors have called for a secret meeting to plan for a circus...

523
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,180

抱歉...我必须早点带他们离开
Sorry. Sorry I have to take the warriors away so early...

528
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,100
因为你们知道的  他...他们有很多事情要做

00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,540
赶快...赶快进去里面
Okay, just... just... just get in there. Go!

534
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,290
快...
Go, go, go!

535
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,510
你们怎么可能是马戏团团员?
Circus bugs? How can you be circus bugs?

536
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,840
什么  喂...
- What? - Oh... - Hey, hey, hey.

537
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,300
你根本没有说到要杀蚱蜢  你欺骗我们嘛
You said nothin' about killin' grasshoppers, pal. You lied to us!

538
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,390
你在开玩笑吗  现在都什么时候了
Are you kidding? Do you know what this is?

539
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,060
朋友们  这叫做不实的广告
This, my friends, is false advertising.

540
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,150
你好大胆子  先生  你才是这出戏里的郎中
How dare you! You, sir, are the charlatan in this scenario...

541
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,400
装成一个星探到处招摇
touting your wares as a talent scout...

542
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,400
欺骗那些穷途潦倒艺人的灵魂
preying upon the hungry souls of hapless artistes.

543
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,400
再见了  先生
Good day to you, sir.

544
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,830
等...你们不能走啊
Wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go.

545
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,750
你们得帮帮我  给我时间  我会想出办法的
You have got to help me. Give me some time. I'll come up with a plan.

546
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,240
只要告诉他们真相啊  他们不能...
- Just go tell them the truth! - They can't...

547
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,210
不能知道真相  因为真相很糟糕
They can't know the truth. The truth, you see, is bad.

548
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,910
我这辈子都会因为  这个错误抬不起头来的
I will be branded with this mistake for the rest of my life.

549
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,260
我的孩子的孩子走在街上
My children's children will walk down the street...

550
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,470
别人会指着他说  看  这就是那个失败者飞力的后代
and people will point and say, "Look! There goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!"

551
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,230
哦  算了  好吧...那...你们走吧
Oh... oh, oh, you know, all right, fine. Yeah, okay. Just go.

552
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,810
但如果你们在离开前 能够帮我一个忙
But if you could just do me a little favour before you leave.

553
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,820
如果你们能够踩死我  那就太好了
Um, if you could squish me, that would be great, because, uh...

554
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,820
因为等他们发现我也会完蛋的
when they find out, I'm as good as dead.

555
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,940
飞力
Flik!

556
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:53,320
我真的认为  我也应该参与这个会议喔  飞力
I really do think I should be part of this meeting. Flik!

557
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,330
啊  雅婷公主  见到你真好
Princess Atta! What a nice surprise.

558
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,170
告诉我  到底发生什么事了
Just what exactly is going on?

559
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,500
我也想跟这些  你所谓的战士谈一谈
I would like to speak with the so-called "warriors."

560
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,250
不行  因为他们现在正在  开高度的机密会议
You can't! I mean, they are in the middle of a top secret meeting right now...

561
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,250
我们真的不应该去打扰他们的
and they really should not be disturbed now.

562
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,420
对吧  各位?
Right, guys?

563
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,090
请恕...请恕我失陪一下
Could you ex... pl... Could you excuse... Uh, could you excuse me, please?

564
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,180
等等...拜托不要走  我那儿也不会去啊
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go! - I'm not going anywhere.

565
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,350
到底怎么回事啊  飞力
What is going on? Flik?

566
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,520
飞力  我就知道
Flik! Ooh, I knew it!

567
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,650
等...拜托不要走啊
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!

568
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,820
不...  快  他快疯了  不...
- No! - Quick, he's losin' it! - No, no, no, no!

569
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,780
你们不能走  我已经走投无路了  是吗  我看不出来啊
- You can't go! I'm desperate! - Really? I couldn't tell.

570
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,160
翅膀  加油
Hmm. Come on, wings.

571
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,540
救命
Help!

572
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,830
妈  飞力又在搞鬼了
Mother, Flik is up to something.

573
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,670
不  飞力  现在该放你下来了
- No! No! - Okay, Flik, time to put ya down now.

574
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,710
求求你们不要走  我快撑不住了  不
- Get him off me! He's cutting off the circulation to my foot. - No, no!

575
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,630
不...  快放手
- No, no, no, no! - Let go!

576
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,930
求求你们不要走  放开竿子  飞力  我说真的
- Oh, please! Please! Don't go! - Put the stick down. Flik, I mean it, now.

577
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,970
放开竿子  放手  快跑啊
- Drop the stick. Drop it. - Run!

578
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,480
老天  这小砘锱艿幕拐婵
Boy, he runs fast for a little guy.

579
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,740
往这边
This way.

580
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,120
他们在那儿
There they are.

581
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,540
有鸟  飞力
- A bird! - Flik!

582
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,750
你看  小不点
- Look! - Dot!

583
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,170
飞力
Flik!

584
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,840
小不点  我的宝贝
- Dot! - My baby!

585
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,220
我来了...
Huh? I gotcha! I gotcha!

586
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,310
我来了...
I gotcha, I gotcha!

587
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,020
我看不见  快想想办法呀
- I can't see! - Somebody do something!

588
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,480
他们没事吧  有谁看到了吗  他们还活着吗
- Are they all right? - Can anyone see? Are they alive?

589
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,150
我看不到  到底怎么回事
- I can't see! - What is happening?

590
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,070
小不点? 天哪  他们有麻烦了
- Dot? - Good heavens, they're in trouble!

591
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,450
法兰斯...  各位  我有个点子了
- Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis... - Oh, you guys, I've got an idea!

592
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,370
来  让我来看
Here! I've got it!

593
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,750
拜托  小姐  醒醒...醒醒...
Please, ma'am, wake up! Wake up!

594
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,170
救命啊  救命...  吁呼
- Help! Help! - Yoo-hoo!

595
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,350
早起的鸟先生  快来吃竿子上面  美味可口的肥虫虫
Mr Early Bird! How about a nice, tasty worm on a stick?

596
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,270
我快断了...
I'm going to snap. I'm going to snap.

597
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,560
来抓我这只又肥又大的肥虫虫
Nice and juicy, succulent...

598
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,690
我们走
Let's go!

599
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,980
他们在那里  飞力  救命
- There they are! - Flik! Help!

600
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,160
好了
Okay.

601
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,820
飞力  没事了  小不点
- Flik! - It's going to be okay, Dot.

602
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,700
拜拜  大笨鸟
Bye-bye, birdie!

603
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,210
救命啊  我被卡住了  拉我下去
Help! I'm stuck! Pull me down!

604
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,920
那只毛毛虫用他自己当诱饵  多勇敢啊
- The caterpillar's using himself as live bait! - How brave!

605
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,180
收小腹啊  老兄
Suck it in, man!

606
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,980
噢  我的腿
Ow. My leg!

607
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,790
那只鸟...小心那只鸟啊
The bird! The bird! Look out for the bird!

608
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,460
飞力
Flik!

609
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,210
上...
Up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a!

610
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,020
什么声音?
What is that?

611
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,400
我的朋友们  那种声音应该叫做鼓掌声
That, my friends, is the sound of applause!

612
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,130
鼓掌声  很爽
Applause... I'm in heaven!

613
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,240
小蓝莓童军向各位致敬  因为你们救了
Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs for rescuing our smallest member,

614
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,090
我们最聪明的小不点公主
Princess Dot.

615
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,640
为了感谢法兰斯小姐  我们改了我们的披肩布
And as a tribute to Miss Francis, we've changed our bandannas!

616
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,390
我们决定要选你当我们的干妈
We voted you our honorary den mother!

617
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
什么  太好了
What? Great.

618
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,840
好了  孩子们  快点离开这个地方了
All right, girls. Let's move your little keisters outta here now.

619
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,500
你们知道病人需要休息的  快走啦
The patient needs her rest, you know. Come on.

620
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,300
呃...对不起  飞力  我可以跟你说句话吗
Oh, excuse me, Flik. Can I talk to you just for a second?

621
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,550
当然  呃
- Huh? Oh, sure. - Oww!

622
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,560
我要再次的非常非常感谢你们
Again, uh, thank you all, very, very much.

623
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,770
噢  不客气  你太好了  谢谢
- Oh, stop it. - You're too kind. - Thank you.

624
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,230
你想我没冒犯到那些战士吧  你? 没有
- You don't think I've offended the warriors, do you? - You? No.

625
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,610
噢  那就好  因为
Oh, good. Because, you see...

626
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,860
你刚带他们回来的时候  我还以为你雇用了一群小丑呢
when you first brought them here, I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

627
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,240
真的?
Ya did?

628
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,700
别告诉他们我这么说喔  老天
Don't tell 'em I said that. Boy,

629
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,450
我最不需要的  就是再犯一个大错
that's all I'd need, another royal blunder like that.

630
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,120
公主  你表现的好极了  谢了  你真甜
- Princess, you're doin' a great job. - Thanks. You're sweet.

631
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,710
你错了  但很窝心
You're wrong but sweet.

632
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,540
我知道他们心里都怎么想  我不懂你的意思
- I know what everyone really thinks. - I don't follow you.

633
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:25,960
每个人  这整个蚁岛  没有人认为我能胜任这工作
Everyone... the whole colony. Nobody really believes I can do this job.

634
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,840
这就好像好像他们都在看着我
It's like they're all watching me...

635
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,220
等着...等着...  等着看你搞砸吧
- just, just... - Waiting for you to screw up.

636
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,730
飞力  我应该向你道歉  为什么?
- Flik, I owe you an apology. - For what?

637
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,690
我以前对你不太好  很抱歉
Well, I haven't been that nice to you, and I'm sorry.

638
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,820
如果有我能补偿你的地方  嘿  有了
If there's any way I can make it up to you... Hey! I know!

639
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,990
你要不要当皇家武士的助手 和那些战士沟通
How would you like to be the queen's official aide to the warrior bugs?

640
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:54,370
我?   对呀  你跟他们的关系非常好啊
- Me? - Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport going with them...

641
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,870
尤其是你救了小不点  你是那么的勇敢
especially after that rescue... it was very brave.

642
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,420
真的?   不是每只虫都敢对抗鸟的
- Really? Naw, naw... - Well, not every bug would face a bird.

643
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,000
你知道  连霸王都怕鸟  是啊  话是没错
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of'em. - Yeah, well, I guess maybe I have...

644
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,800
再说一次  我说  就连霸王都怕鸟啊
- Say that again? - I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

645
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,010
谢谢
Thank you.

646
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,960
霸王他也怕鸟  我不会怪他
- Hopper's afraid of birds! - And I don't blame 'im!

647
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,130
哦...这太完美了
Oh, oh, oh, this is perfect.

648
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,970
我们可以除掉霸王  而且还可以保住我的面子
We can get rid of Hopper, and no one has to know that I messed up.

649
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,760
你们只要假装你们还是战士
You just keep pretending you're warriors.

650
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,890
等等  飞力  我们没打算跟蚱蜢作战好吗?
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not about to fight grasshoppers, okay?

651
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,560
你们可以在 蚱蜢到达之前就走了  这很简单  就这么做
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive. It'll be easy. Here's what we do.

652
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,460
呃...什么都别说
Not another word.

653
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,270
我不知道你的蚂蚁  小脑袋里在打什么歪主意
I don't know what you're concocting in that little ant brain of yours...

654
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,230
但是我绝对不参与
but we'll have no part of it.

655
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,320
对不起  我们可以请战士签名吗?
Excuse me? Could we get the warriors' autographs?

656
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,320
签名?
Autographs?

657
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,950
太好了  太棒了  你们两个看到今天行动没有啊
- Oh, wow! Great! - So, you fellas catch the action today?

658
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,080
噢  那只鸟差一点就把你吃掉了
Oh! The bird went... and it just missed you!

659
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:56,000
你真可爱  你假装卡在裂缝的办法好棒喔
- Oh, aren't you sweet? - And the way you pretended to be stuck in that huge crack!

660
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,880
那只是计划中的一部份  是的
- Oh, that's just all part of the plan. - Yeah, yeah.

661
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,130
还有...你们又冲到草里面去
And then you dive-bombed into the bush!

662
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,630
拿去吧  孩子  哇  谢了
- There you go, my boy. - Wow! Thanks!

663
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,680
少...少校?
"M-M-Maa-jor..."

664
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,930
我是曼尼上校  小伙子
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

665
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:12,310
我的官阶比谁都大 记住这点喔  是  长官
- I outrank everyone here. Remember that. - Yes, sir!

666
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,430
解...散  哇哦
- Dismissed! - Wow!

667
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,810
等我长大  我也要当螳螂  我要当竹节虫
- When I grow up, I'm gonna be a praying mantis! - I'm gonna be a stick bug!

668
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,150
噢  他们都好酷  不知道该选谁
Oh, they're all so cool, I can't pick!

669
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:25,450
噢  好可爱的孩子啊  呃...你刚刚说什么?
Delightful lads. You were saying, Flik?

670
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,660
听好  我们现在要做一只假鸟
All right. We are going to build a bird...

671
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,290
一只可以从里面操纵的鸟  我们把鸟藏在...
a bird that we can operate from the inside, which would then be hoisted above our anthill...

672
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,920
藏在树上并且能从蚁穴上升起
Hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree.

673
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,960
等霸王跟他的党羽一出现
Then, right when Hopper and his gang are below...

674
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,920
我们就放出那只假鸟吓跑那些蚱蜢
we'll launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers.

675
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,550
这必须得动用所有人...
Now it's going to take...

676
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,260
所有人的参与才能让这个计划实现
Everyone's involvement to make this plan a reality.

677
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,470
我知道我们蚂蚁的传统  一向是循规蹈矩
I know it's not our tradition to do things differently...

678
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,930
但是如果我们的祖先  能建立这蚁穴
but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill...

679
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,560
我们当然可以同心协力  去完成这只大鸟
we can certainly rally together to build this bird!

680
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:26,670
太好了  好  各就各位
- Perfect! - Okay, hit your marks!

681
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,030
嗨  飞力  哦
- Hi, Flik. - Oh.

682
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,030
好喜欢她的触角喔  就是啊  谢谢
- Do you mind passing the sugar crumbs? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you.

683
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,290
她的眼睛好漂亮  哦  谢谢
- I love what you did with your antenna. - Oh, thank you.

684
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,290
你看  她真是天生的母亲
Oh, look. She's a natural mother.

685
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,670
好了  我受够了  走开  走开  大家都走开
All right, that's it! Out! Out! Everybody out!

686
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,000
怎么样现在你们要哭了对吧  你们哭吧  我才不怕呢?
Okay, now you're gonna cry, right? You're gonna cry.

687
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,050
尽管哭啊  哭啊
See if I care. Go ahead and cry. Go ahead.

688
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,470
拜托  不要哭  拜托
Please, don't cry. Please. Huh?

689
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,860
好  低一点...
Okay, lower, lower...

690
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,900
就是这样...
You got it. And that's it!

691
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,660
东缝缝  西补补...东缝缝
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

692
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,700
好了
Done!

693
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:40,290
干的好  各位  干的好
Good job, guys! Nice work!

694
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:48,260
上  下...
Up, down. Up, down. Up, down.

695
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,010
你输了
Read 'em and weep.

696
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,200
飞力  小心
Flik, watch out!

697
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,580
我是一只漂亮的蝴蝶
Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!

698
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,210
好极了  各位  大家继续努力
There ya go. Good job, fellas. Keep up the good work.

699
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,900
好  拉
Okay!

700
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,860
你在飞啦
You're fired!

701
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,410
好耶
Yes!

702
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,260
（危险）

703
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,300
（危险）

704
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,760
看看我  我光着脚耶
Whoo-hoo! Look at me! I'm barefootin'! Whoo-hoo!

705
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,260
嘿  蚊子  来两份杂粮  快点
Yo, bugito, dos granitos, pronto!

706
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,470
你得来试试看这个呀
You gotta try this, man!

707
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,580
我们有足够的食物
We have more than enough food.

708
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,450
如果我们回到那里  又刚好碰到那里下雨
We go all the way back there and it starts to rain,

709
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,170
那我们不等于去送死嘛?
we might as well be suckin' bug spray.

710
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,630
哦  你说的没错  你知道吗?
Ooh, don't even say that! You know somethin'?

711
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,340
回去等于送死  我是说干嘛冒险呢?
You're makin' a lot of sense. I mean, why take the risk?

712
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,390
你应该去告诉霸王的  好主意
- You should tell Hopper. - Good idea.

713
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,970
但是...你知道  我们真的没有立场
But, you know, it's really not our place.

714
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,390
我是说  你是他弟弟啊  你就像...
I mean, you're his brother. That makes you, like, uh...

715
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,640
咱们这里帮派的副总裁
the vice president of the gang.

716
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,310
哇  那倒是真的  对吧
Wow! It kinda does, doesn't it?

717
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,730
好  我去告诉他  老天  我真该跟你们多聊聊的
Okay, I'll tell 'im. Boy, I should talk to you guys more often.

718
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,610
如果霸王不喜欢呢?   那也是这傻蛋挨扁  又不是我们
- What if Hopper doesn't like it? - Then at least the genius will get smacked and not us.

719
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,410
毛头副总裁
Vice President Molt.

720
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,660
好  好极了
Ooh, yeah, that's good. Oh, that's good.

721
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:08,710
低...低一点  低一点  嗨  霸王
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower, lower. - Hey ya, Hop.

722
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,790
走开  好  那我就不告诉你我的点子
- Go away. - That's fine. Then I won't tell ya my idea.

723
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,880
很好  拜托拜托  让我告诉你吧
- Good! - Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.

724
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,090
我一直在想哦  你知道我身为副总裁嘛
You see, I've been thinkin', okay, which is somethin' that I do, you know, bein' vice president and all.

725
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,210
我想到了一个好点子  我们干嘛还要再回蚁岛呢?
And this is a thought. And it was mine. Why go back to Ant Island at all?

726
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,010
反正你也不爱吃谷子嘛
I mean, you don't even like grain.

727
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,470
什么?   对啊  我也不觉得这是一个好点子
- What? - You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea myself.

728
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,350
这不是我的点子  是阿轴和阿洛的
Actually, it wasn't even my idea. It was Axle and Loco's!

729
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,980
他们说得好好听  我都听糊涂了
They talked fancy to me. I got confused!

730
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,580
各位  大家可以继续唱
Guys, order another round...

731
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,370
因为我们决定留下来了
because we're stayin' here!

732
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,960
我在干什么  居然还想回蚂蚁岛
What was I thinking? Going back to Ant Island.

733
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,440
我是说我们刚到这
I mean, we just got here,

734
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,300
而且我们有足够的食物 能够渡过冬天  对吧
and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter.

735
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,380
干嘛还回去?
Right? Why go back?

736
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,890
但是那里有只小蚂蚁敢反抗我
But there was that ant that stood up to me.

737
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,650
是啊  但是我们可以不要理他  没错  只是一只小蚂蚁
- Yeah, but we can forget about him! - Yeah, it was just one ant.

738
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,900
一只蚂蚁
One ant!

739
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,070
说的好  他不过只是只小蚂蚁
Yeah, you're right! It's just one ant!

740
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,860
是啊  老大 微不足道   微不足道?
- Yeah, boss. They're puny! - Hmm, puny.

741
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:29,540
那如果这谷谷子 是只微不足道的小蚂蚁
Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant.

742
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,620
这会痛吗  不会
- Did that hurt? - Nope.

743
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:35,210
那这个呢  别开玩笑啦
- Well, how 'bout this one? - Are you kiddin'?

744
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,380
那么这样呢?
Well, how 'bout this?

745
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,520
只要让一只蚂蚁  站出来对抗我们
You let one ant stand up to us...

746
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,650
他们全部会挺身而出
then they all might stand up.

747
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,690
那些微不足道的小蚂蚁  可是我们蚱蜢的一百倍
Those puny little ants outnumber us 100 to one.

748
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,660
如果他们搞懂这一点  我们可就没得混了
And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!

749
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:12,330
我要的不只是食物  而是要给这些蚂蚁一点教训
It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line.

750
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:15,330
所以我们要回去
That's why we're going back!

751
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,580
还有什么人想留下?
Does anybody else wanna stay?

752
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,010
霸王说话可真有说服力对吧?
He's quite the motivational speaker, isn't he?

753
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,840
咱们飞
Let's ride!

754
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,610
敬那只鸟...  那只鸟
- To the bird! - The bird!

755
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,160
下来吧  小胖胖
Get down, roly boys!

756
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,380
看你能多低  一起来  看你能多低
- How low can you go? Sing it now. - How low can you go

757
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,630
快啊公主  看你能多低?
Do it, Princess. How low can you go

758
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,960
我第十二任老公就这么死了
And that's how my 12th husband died.

759
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,800
我也成了寡妇了  我一直是个黑寡妇
So, now I'm a widow. I mean, I've always been a black widow...

760
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,260
现在是守寡的黑寡妇
but now I'm a black widow widow.

761
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,400
贺利  那些煞星来了吗  我来看看
- Thorny! Any sign of those fiends? - Let me check.

762
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,320
还没有  但我们都严阵以待
No, not yet. But we'll be ready for 'em.

763
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,160
小蓝莓  解散
Blueberries, dismissed!

764
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,160
别再打那些男孩了
And, uh, quit beatin' the boys up.

765
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,710
这些小砘镎婵砂
Those little raisins do grow on ya.

766
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,870
嘿  怎么样  玩得开不开心啊
Hey, how you guys doin'? Some party, huh?

767
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,920
这些稻谷都还很新鲜吧  好了
Is that grain dip fresh or what? Okay.

768
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,250
我会告诉你们  什么时候到指挥中心
I've told everyone you'll be stationed deep in the command bunker.

769
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:49,930
等他们热闹起来  我会带你们走后门  你们就能够离开了
Party quiets down, I sneak you out the back way and then you're outta here forever.

770
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,850
迪姆不想离开
Dim don't wanna go.

771
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:56,600
如果迪姆留下  他会需要我  他还得要包尿布
Well, if Dim stays he's gonna need me here. He's not fully trained.

772
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,690
我说他还小
I mean, house-trained.

773
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,070
我呃...我答应小蓝莓童军  要教他们玩纸牌
I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries I'd teach 'em canasta.

774
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,940
看来我们已经  订下了延期的约定了
It seems we've been booked for an extended engagement.

775
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,410
你看到这些蚂蚁了吗  飞力  你看到这些蚂蚁了吗
Will you look at this colony? Will you just look at this colony?

776
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,830
我几乎都不认识他们了
I don't even recognize it.

777
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,960
我觉得我又回到70岁了
I feel 70 again!

778
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,130
锻炼你的小腹  帅哥
Work that ab, baby!

779
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,800
这都是你们的功劳  所以  谢谢了
And I have you bugs to thank for it. So... thank you!

780
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,970
还有...谢谢你找到他们  飞力
And, uh, thank you for findin' 'em, Flik.

781
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,220
我? 对不起...  我来
- Me? - Oops. - Oh, ooh... uh, uh, I'll get it.

782
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,300
你不介意的话  让我来好了
I mean, if you don't mind, I'll just, I'll just...

783
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,260
都缠在一起了
It's all tangled up.

784
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,560
好了  哦
- There. - Ow!

785
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,890
我想我该去检查那只鸟了
I think I'll go check on the bird.

786
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,900
鸟在那边  对啊  鸟在那边
- Bird's this way. - Yeah, the bird's that way.

787
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,110
她走错了...干嘛
She... What?

788
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,580
我的老天爷啊
Jiminy H. Cricket!

789
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,290
他们回来了  大伙儿快准备
They're back! Get ready, everybody!

791
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,880
所有人  就战斗位置  这不是演习
Battle stations, everyone. This is not a drill!

792
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,640

794
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,850
哦  稳住...
Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Steady, girls. That's it.

795
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,400
跳蚤团长  团长?
- It's P.T. - P. T?

796
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,940
你们大家好  你们好吗?
Greetings and salutations! Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?

797
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:35,410
我是伟大的跳蚤团长
I am the great P.T. Flea!

798
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,740
我需要你们的协助  长话短说吧
I'm in need of your assis... Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

799
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,210
我从一个蚁穴到另一个蚁穴
Look, I've been goin' from anthill to anthill.

800
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,790
我是在找一群马戏团的艺人  你们看过他们没?
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus performers. Have you seen 'em?

801
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:52,590
请等一下  那不是士官长阿竿吗  不...
- Wait a second. Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim? - Nope! No, no, no.

802
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,430
对不起  我们这儿从来没有人 见过像你要找的人  安静
- I'm sorry, no, but, uh, no one has seen anyone like that around here. - Be quiet!

803
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,800
既然没有人见过的话  嘿
- No one has ever seen anyone like that around here. - Hey!

804
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,890
你应该到别处去找
So, you'll probably... you'll probably want to get goin'.

805
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,940
很多其它蚁穴要找  所以呢  再见了
I guess you got a lot of other anthills to check into, so, bye!

806
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,820
大伙儿  我在到处找你们团长  不要  死亡火焰大受欢迎
Ah, guys, I've been lookin' all over for ya! Flaming Death is a huge hit!

807
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,320
我是说真的 团长  嘘  消息传的很快  不  团长
- P. T! Sh... I'm serious! Word of mouth got around. - P. T! No!

808
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,950
第二天有一堆的苍蝇 在帐蓬外面排队
The next day, there was a line of flies outside the tent went on forever!

809
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,110
而且大排长龙 有一尺那么长  不  团长
- It must have been a foot long! - P.T., no!

810
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,410
我想... 团长  别说了  你们一晚烧我两次  我花一天来疗伤
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me twice a night, I take a day off to heal.

811
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,500
然后我们再继续表演
And then we do it all over again!

812
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,710
我们会是这个圈子里 最棒的马戏团
We'll be the top circus act in the business!

813
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,750
你是说  你们不是战士  你在开玩笑吗
- You mean, you're not warriors? - Are you kiddin'?

814
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,760
这些砘锸悄慵过最差劲的马戏团员
These guys are the lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.

815
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,340
不过我得靠他们发财
And they're gonna make me rich!

816
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,510
你是在告诉我我们整个防御策略
You mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy...

817
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,850
是由小丑想出来的?
was concocted by clowns?

818
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,140
嘿   我们也认为  飞力点子行得通喔
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought Flik's idea was gonna work.

819
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,070
告诉我这不是真的
Tell me this isn't true.

820
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,980
不  你不会...不会以为...  这事件发生的时间太不适当了
- No, you don't... You don't... - This couldn't have happened at a more inopportune time!

821
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:55,070
最后一片叶子快掉了
The last leaf is about to fall!

822
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,450
我们还没为蚱蜢  收集够多的食物
We haven't collected any food for the grasshoppers!

823
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,620
如果霸王发现我们差点做的事
If Hopper finds out what we almost did...

824
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,790
霸王绝对不会发现的
Hopper is not going to find out.

825
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,420
我们会藏起一切  假装什么事也没有发生过
We're going to hide all this and pretend it never happened.

826
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,290
你们这些虫虫从来没有来过  请你们赶快走吧
You bugs were never here. So I suggest you all leave.

827
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,130
但是那只鸟  那只鸟绝对会有用的
But the bird! The-The-The bird will work.

828
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:17,260
我从来没有想到  我居然会看到一只蚂蚁
I never thought I'd see the day when an ant would put himself...

829
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,390
只顾自己而不管他的同胞的  什么
- before the rest of his colony. - What?

830
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,060
重点是  飞力  你欺骗了我们  不...我只是...
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us. - No, no, no! L-I just...

831
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,890
你说谎  飞力  你欺骗了皇后
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.

832
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,650
你欺骗了蚂蚁岛  也欺骗了我
You lied to the colony! You lied to me!

833
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,980
而我却像个白痴一样的相信你
And like an idiot, I believed you.

834
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,570
但是我...我就是害怕
But l-I was just afraid that...

835
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,910
如果你知道 我找的是马戏团的团员
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...

836
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,250
我不过是想...帮助大家  我要你离开  飞力
- I just wanted to make a difference. - I want you to leave, Flik.

837
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,830
而且这次  不要再回来了
And this time, don't come back.

838
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,720
还真复杂
Tough crowd. Yee-haw!

839
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,270
飞力
Flik!

840
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,030
只有这些?   但这个岛上一定有更多的食物的
That's it? But there's got to be more food on the island!

841
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,120
如果交出更多我们就会挨饿
If we give up any more, we'll starve.

842
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,740
霸王不会接受这些的
Hopper won't accept this!

843
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:15,000
妈  这些根本不够怎么办啊?
Mother, it's not enough. What do we do?

844
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,050
我...我不知道
I...I don't know.

845
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,620
你们这些坏东西
You little termites!

846
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:53,710
我给你们第二次机会  结果只有这些?
I give you a second chance, and this is all I get?

847
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,790
但霸王我们没有足够的时间啊
But, Hopper, we ran out of time!

848
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:01,720
你们整个夏天都在玩耍吗  你们以为这是办家家酒啊?
Have you been playing all summer? You think this is a game?

849
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,260
不...拜托  你猜怎么着?
- No, no, please! - Well, guess what!

850
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,350
你们糗大了
You just lost.

851
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:14,390
所有的蚂蚁都不准睡觉  直到你们把岛上所有的稻谷
Not one ant sleeps until we get every scrap of food...

852
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,730
全都给我找出来
on this island!

853
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,780
最好听他的命令  别惹他发火  相信我
Just do what he says. You don't want to make him mad. Believe me!

854
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:25,450
不...皇后殿下  你得留在我身边
No, no, no. You're staying with me, Your Highness.

855
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,950
你想溜吗   到那边去
Where do you think you're going? Get over there!

856
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,370
快  到俱乐部去
Quick! To the clubhouse.

857
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,210
快点
Hurry!

858
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,970
大家不要吵  我好像听到什么声音
- Shut up a minute, will ya? - I think I heard something over here.

859
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,140
你们找过那边没有啊?   还没有
- Have you checked over there? - No, not yet.

860
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,350
那就赶快到那边去找啊
Well then, get over there and check it out!

861
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,360
等一下
Wait a minute.

862
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,730
我好像找到东西了喔
Hey, I think I found something.

863
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:09,030
嘿  好酷喔  我看起来怎么样?  像个冬瓜
- Cool. Hey, how do I look? - Like an idiot.

864
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,330
我很喜欢 下雨天还能够遮雨喔
I don't know, maybe it'll keep me dry in the rain.

865
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:14,330
你这白痴  我们会在下雨前离开
You moron, we'll be out of here before it rains.

866
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,330
你没听霸王说吗  等蚂蚁采集完所有食物
Didn't you hear Hopper? After the ants pick all the food...

867
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,710
他就杀了皇后 提醒他们谁是老大
he's gonna squish the queen to remind 'em who's boss.

868
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,630
然后她死了  大家哭  我们回家  就这么简单
Then she's dead. They cry... boo-hoo. We go home. End of story.

869
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,470
好酷  当蚱蜢真好
Oh! Cool. I love our job.

870
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,930
别乱跑  我得去求救
Stay here. I'm gonna get help.

871
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,480
翅膀加油  飞啊...
Come on, wings, fly. Fly!

872
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,620
耶
Yeah! Whoa-oh!

873
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,640
钱钱钱...我的钱...我要发大财  我的钱...
I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich

874
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,310
我要成为岛上最富有的蚱蜢
I'm gonna be the richest flea in the land

875
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,440
街道上将会遍布淘金者
The streets'll be paved with golden retrievers

876
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,690
我要发大财  那才是我
I'm rich, rich, rich That's who I am

877
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,320
可怜的砘  也许我们能让他开心点
- Poor fellow. - Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

878
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,950
飞力  别难过  马戏团的生活没那么糟
Don't worry, Flik. The circus life isn't so bad.

879
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,830
是啊  你可以加入我们的表演  对  就像这样
- Yes, you can be part of our act. - Here! Like this.

880
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,290
表演闹剧  懂了吗?
Slapstick! Get it?

881
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:29,380
我是只竹节虫...算了
L-I'm a walking stick. Oh, never mind.

882
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,590
飞力  小不点?
- Flik! - Dot?

883
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,760
飞力  等等...
Flik, wait! Wait!

884
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,810
小不点  你会飞了  你来这里做什么啊?
Dot, you're flying! What are you doing here?

885
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,270
你必须要回去
You have to go back.

886
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,100
霸王跑到蚁穴里来  他的党羽要吃掉所有的食物
Hopper moved into the anthill, and his gang's eating everything!

887
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,190
噢  不  我的天啊
- Oh! - Oh, no! - Good heavens!

888
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,610
而且我听到一只蚱蜢说  等他们吃完
And I heard a grasshopper say that when they're finished...

889
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,860
霸王要杀我的妈妈
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!

890
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,950
哦  别吃皇后  大家赶快想点办法  什么办法?
- Oh, not the queen! - We gotta do something! - How?

891
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,740
快点  快想啊  哦  我知道  那只假鸟
- Come on, you guys, think! - I know. The bird.

892
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,910
说的没错  对  那只鸟  太棒了
- Yes, of course. - The bird! That's brilliant.

893
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,830
那只鸟没有用的
The bird won't work.

894
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,920
你在说什么啊   那是你的点子  但你说过一切都会...
- What are you talking about? It was your idea. - But you said that everything...

895
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:07,590
小不点  忘掉我跟你说过的一切好吗?
Forget everything I ever told you. All right, Dot?

896
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:11,050
整个蚁岛说的对  我只会把事情搞砸
Let's face it. The colony is right. I just make things worse.

897
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:16,390
那只鸟...它保证会失败的  就像我一样
That bird is a guaranteed failure. Just like me.

898
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,600
你听我说  孩子  我才是一个天生的失败者
You listen to me, my boy. I've made a living out of being a failure.

899
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,390
而先生你  并不是输家
And you, sir, are not a failure!

900
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,400
飞力  你做了那么多的好事  是吗
- Oh, but Flik, you've done so many good things. - Oh, yeah?

901
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,480
好吧  你告诉我做过哪些好事?
Okay, show me one thing I've done right.

902
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,200
我们  是的
- Us. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

903
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:36,570
迪姆说的对  孩子
Dim is right, my boy. You have rekindled...

904
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,990
你让我们再度拥有生活目标点燃了希望之火
the long-dormant embers of purpose in our lives.

905
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,040
而且要不是你  法兰斯也不会 找到他女性化的一面
And if it wasn't for you, Francis would have never gotten in touch with his feminine side.

906
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:48,130
哦  是吗? 我...  知道吗? 他说的对
Oh yeah? Well... Hmm. You know what? He's right.

907
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,880
吉普赛中尉报到  请求派任
Lieutenant Gypsy reporting for duty.

908
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:55,380
孩子  只要开口  我们就会追随你  我们对你有信心啊  孩子
- Kid, say the word and we'll follow you into battle. - We believe in you, my boy.

909
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:58,050
飞力  求求你
Flik, please?

910
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,750
假装它是种子好吗?
Pretend it's a seed, okay?

911
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,630
谢了  小不点
Thanks, Dot.

912
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,350
那石头怎么了?   八成是他们的习俗
- Hey, what's with the rock? - Must be an ant thing.

913
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:45,940
好吧  我们回去  这才是我们认识的飞力
- All right, let's do it. - That's the Flik we know and love.

914
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,870
上场吧  说  我们要先做什么?
- We're on! - So, what do we do first?

915
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,540
虫虫花大钱  大家看表演
Bugs will pay big bucks to see

916
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,040
我来当主角  保证赚大钱
A bonfire that is starring me

917
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,590
团长  你看  钱耶  在哪? 在哪?
- P.T., look. Money! - Where? Where?

918
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:06,850
好了  动作快  全都给我工作  谁敢给我偷懒
All right. Get movin'! Get goin'. Move your abdomens, now!

919
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,940
他们把大家都抓起来了
They're rounding everyone up.

920
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:15,820
嘿  关掉你的屁灯  嘿  把我给弄出来  好吗
- Hey! Turn your butt off. - Hey, guys! Get me out of this thing, will ya?

921
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,910
我保证会考虑给你们薪水
I promise to start thinkin' about payin' ya.

922
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,660
嘿  等...好了...我付...
Hey! Wait, wait! Okay, I'll pay ya! I'll pay ya!

923
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:24,860
你在干嘛  想偷懒啊?  糟了  他们已经收集完食物了
Oh, no! They've finished collecting the food.

924
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,290
我们得尽快救出皇后
We've got to get the queen now.

925
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,880
等她安全之后  就等吉普赛的讯号
Once she's safe, we move on Gypsy's signal.

926
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,550
有人来了
Someone's coming!

927
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,100
嗨  孩子们  准备好了去痛宰 那些蚱蜢了吗
Hello, kids! Ready to make some grasshoppers cry?

928
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:45,730
报仇的时候到了  小蓝莓集合
It's payback time, Blueberry-style.

929
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:51,360
小蓝莓发飚  耶  好
- Blueberries rock! - Yea! - All right!

930
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,860
各位女士先生  各种阶段的幼虫

我们的确是需要一点娱乐
I guess we could use a little entertainment.

941
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:59,510
看来你总算是  做对一件事情了  公主
Looks like you did something right for once, Princess.

01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:26,330
奶奶喝光了  宝宝要吃派
Ba-ba all gone! Baby wants pie!

945
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:30,250
派? 他想吃派  我应该给他吗
Pie? He asked for it. Should I give it to him?

946
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:34,420
给  给他派...
Yeah! Give 'im pie! Give 'im pie!

Say, how many roaches does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

949
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,180
不知道 每次灯一亮他们全跑了
Can't tell. As soon as the light goes on, they scatter!

950
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:03,610
来  快到了  来自亚洲最神秘的地区  没有人烟的地方
- Almost there. - From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia...

951
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,240
我发现了一个宝物  孩子们  快

952
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:09,450

Of Metamorphosis!

953
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,170
利用心电感应震动原理
Utilizing psychic vibrations...

954
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,790
我将要选择最完美的志愿者  选我
- I shall select the perfect volunteer. - Pick me!

955
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,760
哦  拜托  我正在跟你作心电感应
Ooh, no! Come on. I'm askin' ya with my brain.

956
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,930
皇后殿下  我?
- Aha! Why, Your Majesty! - Me?

957
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,300
不不  山霸  去  让她去
No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.

958
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:27,680
看他能搞什么鬼
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

959
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,220
当你爬上螳螂到未知的境界
As you ascend the dung beetle to the unknown...

960
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:36,060
将你的信任交给俗世  所无法理解的神秘力量
put your trust in the mysteries that are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

961
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:38,320
哦  这一定会很精彩
Ooh, this is gonna be good!

962
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,490
小蓝莓童军  好了吗  好了
- Blueberries ready? - Ready.

963
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:44,740
好了
Ready!

964
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,580
我召唤附身在我们志愿者
I call upon the ancient Szechwan spirits...

965
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:51,250
身上的古老四川神灵
to inhabit the body of our volunteer!

966
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,460
别出来待在里面  皇后殿下
No, no. Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

967
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,920
乾坤挪移...

01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,380
乾坤挪移...

969
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,460
乾坤挪移...

哇  曼尼越来越厉害了
Wow. Manny's gettin' good.

971
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,350
别下雨  如果下雨那只假鸟会被打烂的
- Not now. - If it rains, that bird'll get ripped to shreds!

972
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,730
各位
And now, insectus...

973
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,150
现在请看我的乾坤大挪移
transformitus!

974
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,490
漂亮

谢谢...
Thank you, thank you.

976
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,000
噢  谢谢  讯号来了...讯号来了
- Thank you. - That's the signal. That's the signal!

977
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,960
孩子们  准备好了  开始起飞
This is it, girls. Get ready to roll.

978
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,170
卡住了  真是妙耶
- Huh? It's stuck! - That was amazing!

979
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:48,140
不见了...他们是怎么变的? 连我都不知道她到哪去了
I have no... How did they do that? I have no idea where she went.

980
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,560
谢谢...  再来一个
- Thank you. Thank you, thank you. - More! More! More!

981
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,680
再来  等等
- More! More! More! - Wait!

982
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:56,560
她在哪里  事实上...
- Where is she? - Well, now, uh, actually...

983
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:00,440
噢  对不起  魔术师绝对不能泄露秘密的
I am sorry. A magician never reveals his secrets.

984
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,570
这是真的  霸王  如果我们知道怎么变的  那就不好玩了
That's very true, Hoppy. I mean, where would the mystery be if we all knew how it was...

985
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:06,070
我闭嘴  你们可以的
- Shutting up. - You can do it!

986
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,280
你们得让它起飞啊  嘿
- You've got to make it work! - Hey!

987
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:14,000
我问你她在哪里?
I said, where is she?

988
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,550
坐稳了
Hold on!

989
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,350
鸟  有一只鸟
Bird! It's a bird!

990
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,280
耶
Yes!

991
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,500
我们快逃命吧
Let's get out of here! Go!

992
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,380
别让他抓到我  别让他吃我
Don't-Don't let it get me! Don't let it get me!

993
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:10,090
救命啊...
Help me!

994
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,970
上  下...准备...转弯
Up, down, up, down. And turn!

995
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,820
我的眼睛  救救我
My eye! Help me!

996
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,830
草莓酱
Mmm, boysenberry.

997
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,080
啊  不...
Huh? Aah, no, no, no, no, no!

998
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,670
好痛啊
Oh, the pain!

999
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,220
我的魔术师挂了
There goes my magic act!

1000
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:55,350
死亡火焰伺候  不要  团长
- Flaming Death! - No! P. T!

1001
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,980
正中目标
A direct hit!

1002
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,730
飞力  飞力  救我们
Flik! Flik! Help us!

1003
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,090
小不点
Dot!

1004
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,800
快点  大家出去  快啊
Okay! Everyone out! Hurry!

1005
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:38,390
小不点呢  有人看到小不点吗
Where's Dot? Has anyone seen Dot?

1006
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:45,560
这是谁出的怪点子?
Whose idea was this? Huh?

1007
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:50,940
是你吗  公主?
Was it yours, Princess?

1008
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,940
躲在我身后  不会有事的
Just get behind me, girls. It'll be okay.

1009
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:55,820
放开他  霸王
Leave her alone, Hopper.

1010
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:59,120
那只鸟是我的点子  我才是你要找的人
The bird was my idea. I'm the one you want.

1011
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,720
你吃了熊心豹子胆了  敢这样子对我
Where do you get the gall to do this to me?

1012
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,480
你...你打算要杀了皇后
You were... You were gonna squish the queen.

1013
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:29,980
是真的  我最痛恨有人先透露结局
- It's true. - I hate it when someone gives away the ending.

1014
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:35,490
你这个小虫渣  不  我错了
You piece of dirt! No, I'm wrong.

1015
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:39,620
你比虫渣还要低级  你是...蚂蚁
You're lower than dirt. You're an ant!

1016
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,080
这就当作是  给你们蚂蚁的一个教训
Let this be a lesson to all you ants.

1017
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,370
点子是非常危险的事
Ideas are very dangerous things.

1018
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,960
你们是没有脑袋  只会挖土的苦力
You are mindless, soil-shoving losers...

1019
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:53,970
天生就是要来伺候我们的
put on this earth to serve us!

1020
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,880
你错了  霸王
You're wrong, Hopper.

1021
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:08,150
蚂蚁根本不是服侍蚱蜢的奴隶
Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers!

1022
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:15,360
我看到这些蚂蚁很有能力
I've seen these ants do great things.

1023
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:17,740
而且年复一年的  他们设法采集食物
And year after year, they somehow manage...

1024
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:21,490
给他们自己  还有你们
to pick food for themselves and you.

1025
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:28,000
所以... 谁才是比较弱的种族呢
So-So who is the weaker species?

1026
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,960
蚂蚁不应该怕蚱蜢的
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

1027
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,090
是蚱蜢需要蚂蚁
It's you who need us.

1028
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,760
我们没有你说的那么软弱
We're a lot stronger than you say we are.

1029
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:45,100
你也知道的  对吧?
And you know it, don't you?

1030
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,240
吁  公主
Well, Princess!

1031
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:00,240
霸...霸王  我很不想打岔  但是呢...
Um, Hopper? Um, l-I hate to interrupt, but, um...

1032
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,620
你们全给我退后...
You ants stay back!

1033
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,720
噢  这下子该我们糗大了  霸王  你知道
- Oh, this was such a bad idea! - You see, Hopper...

1034
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,430
大自然有一定的定律
nature has a certain order.

1035
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,560
蚂蚁采集食物  蚂蚁储存这些食物
The ants pick the food, the ants keep the food...

1036
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,890
而蚱蜢最好离开
and the grasshoppers leave!

1037
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,730
我真以你为荣  飞力
I'm so proud of you, Flik!  Charge-a!

1038
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,780
你们要去哪里?  他们只是蚂蚁啊
Where are you going? They're just ants!

1039
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:47,200
哼  坏蛋蚱蜢...  你回家
No! Bad grasshopper! Bad grasshopper! Go home!

1040
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:56,250
耶  回来  你们这些胆小鬼
- Yeah! - Come back here, you cowards!

1041
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,510
不要走  把他塞进大炮  塞进大炮
- Don't leave! - To the cannon! - To the cannon!

1042
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:02,140
不要
No!

1043
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,770
祝你飞行愉快  霸王
Happy landings, Hopper!

1044
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:26,990
下雨了
Rain!

1045
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,060
飞力  快  快去追
- Flik! - Quick! After them!

1046
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:12,660
阿竿?   法兰斯  法兰斯  法兰斯...我被卡住了  你在哪
- Slim! - Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck! - Where are ya?

1047
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,750
我在这里  哪里  这里
- I'm over here! - Where? - Here!

1048
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:18,670
我是唯一有眼睛的树枝
I'm the only stick with eyeballs!

1049
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:22,840
救命啊...  攻击他
- Help! Help! Help! - Get him!

1050
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,440
不
No!

1051
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,330
往那边  可是蚁穴不在那边  我有个点子啊
- Go that way! - But the anthill's over... - I've got an idea!

1052
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:01,710
飞力  快啊
- Flik! - Come on!

1053
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,350
到那边
There!

1054
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:15,180
快  快躲起来
Come on! We've gotta hide!

1055
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:17,440
不管发生什么事情  千万不要出来
No matter what happens, stay down!

1056
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,520
飞力  不  你要做什么?
Flik, no! What are you doing?

1057
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:24,150
霸王  你以为结束了吗
- Hopper! - You think it's over?

1058
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,240
不...我可以解释...
No, no, no. No, I...I can explain.

1059
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,740
你搞的这些小把戏  只是在拖延时间  不  拜托...
- All your little stunt did was buy them time! - No, please!

1060
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:34,200
霸王  明年我会找  更多的蚱蜢回来这里
- Please, Hopper! - I'll get more grasshoppers and be back next season...

1061
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,540
但你...死定了
but you won't!

1062
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:44,710
哦  这又是什么  你又在装神弄鬼吗
Well, what's this? Another one of your little bird tricks?

1063
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,300
对  那里面也有一群小蚂蚁是吗
- Yup. - Are there a bunch of little girls in this one, too?

1064
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:50,680
嗨  小砘锩
Hello, girls!

1065
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,980
不要...
No! No! No, no, no, no!

1066
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:06,240
啊  救命啊
No! No!

1067
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,410
救救我...
Oh, no!

1068
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:13,660
救命啊  不要吃我
Oh, no! No, no, no!

1069
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,460
快点  孩子们  来吧  好
Come on, boys!

1070
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:28,050
小不点公主  等等我  等等我们
Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up!

1071
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:34,930
我终于有机会喘口气  又要离开我的椅子了
I finally get a second to relax, and I gotta get out of my chair.

1072
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:39,440
好了 待会你可以替我擦防晒油了  好棒...
- Come on! You can rub lotion on me later, shade boy. - Yeah, hubba-hubba.

1073
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,230
谢谢  谢谢  你们太好了
- Oh, thank you! - Thank you. - Oh, you're too kind.

1074
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,740
这是我们应该做的  这怎么好意思啊  随时效劳
- It was the least we could do. - All in a day's work. - Any time.

1075
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,410
迪姆
Dim!

1076
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:54,530
对不起  孩子们  我也希望你们能跟来
I'm so sorry, kids. I wish you could come along, too.

1077
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,160
我不能哭...
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.

1078
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,920
快点走吧  我们还有表演呢  快点...
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule to keep. Come on. Let's go.

1079
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,090
嘿  小子  把节目准备好
- Hey! - Hey, Tiny! Let's get this show packed up!

1080
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,180
我们还有观众在等着我们呢
We got paying customers hatching!

1081
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,470
遵命  跳蚤大爷  我马上办
Yes, Mr Flea. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

1082
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,560
不过我先要谢谢  你给我这个机会
And, um, I just wanted to thank you for giving me a chance...

1083
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,480
能和你这种创意大师工作  真是荣幸啊
because it's an honour to work with creative giants such as yourself.

1084
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,650
我闭嘴  你真的不和我们一起去巡回?
- Shutting up. - You sure you can't come on tour with us?

1085
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:26,020
抱歉  我的家在这里
Sorry. My place is here.

1086
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:32,320
说的好  这是你的损失  昆虫们  一分钟  出发
- Good answer. - Oh, well. Your loss. One minute, insects!

1087
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,870
我要谢谢你们虫虫  给我们带来了
I wanna thank all of you for giving us back...

1088
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:38,910
希望  我们的自尊和我们的生命
our hope, our dignity and our lives.

1089
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:43,210
而你呢  雅婷公主  你也给了我们很多
And to you, Princess Atta. You have given us so much.

1090
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,420
请接受我们虫虫给你们蚂蚁
Please accept this gift from us bugs...

1091
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:49,130
的礼物
to you ants.

1092
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:54,220
献给你  哦  是个石头
- For you! - Oh! It's a rock.

1093
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,850
怎么会送石头? 八成是马戏团的习俗
- What's with the rock? - Must be a circus thing.

1094
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,390
噢  飞力你又搞砸了
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.

1095
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,360
谢了  是啊  你也一样
- Thanks. - Yeah, you too.

1096
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:50,230
好了  不要婆婆妈妈了  我们该出发了
All right. Now it's gettin' mushy. We're outta here! Hy-aah!

1097
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:00,950
喔  下一季再见了
- Whoa! - See ya next season!

1098
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,540
飞力  再见  我已经开始想念你们了
- See ya, Flik! - Bye! We miss you already!

1099
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:07,000
你被开除了  你被开除了  我们忘了哈其林
- You fired! - You fired! - We forgot Heimlich!

1100
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:15,550
我长大了  我终于变成一只美丽的花蝴蝶
I'm finished! Finally, I'm a beautiful butterfly!

1101
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,310
我的翅膀  噢  真是美丽的翅膀
Mein wings! Oh, they're beautiful!

1102
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:28,690
哈其林  马车已经走了  你最好开始飞了
Heimlich! The wagon's taking off! You better start flying!

1103
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:34,190
我已经在飞了  从上面看你们  你们都是小蚂蚁
But I am flying! And from way up here, you all look like little ants!

1104
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,990
后会有期  保重了
Auf Wiedersehen!

1105
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:38,820
再见
Bye!

1106
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,620
展示茎干
Present stalks!

1107
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,790
收割机...敬礼
Harvester, salute!

1108
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,820
剧终

1109
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:37,340
Was a bug, little bug

1110
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,550
Hardly there

1111
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,140
How he felt, what he dreamed

1112
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,230
Who would care

1113
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:53,610
Without any evidence  His flaws were many, ooh

1114
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:57,280
He was full of confidence  Some people haven't any

1115
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,320
Didn't have much common sense  It's highly overrated

1116
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,580
Hejust knew that he'd come through

1117
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:07,700
It's the time of your life

1118
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:10,120
So live it well

1119
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,420
It's the time of your life

1120
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,460
So live it well

1121
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:24,720
We may only go round one time

1122
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,720
As far as I can tell

1123
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:31,140
It's the time of your life

1124
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,650
So live it well

1125
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:38,440
We may only go round this one time

1126
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:41,820
As far as I can tell  He could be wrong about that

1127
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:45,120
It's the time of your life  Time, life

1128
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:49,040
It's the time of your life  Time, life

1129
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,330
It's the time of your life

1130
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:55,710
So live it well

1131
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:59,300
预备  打板  好  开始
- Speed! - Marker. - And... action!

1132
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:01,380
你是说我是个笨蛋?
Are you saying I'm stupid?

1133
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:04,050
不  你觉得我看起来像个笨蛋?
- No. - Do I look stupid to you?

1134
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

1135
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:12,480
你是说我像个笨蛋?
Are you saying I'm stupid? Oh!

1136
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:19,360
对不起  我可以了  不...再来一次...
I'm sorry. I got it. No, no, no. Just do it again. I'm fine.

1137
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:22,780
你是说我是个笨蛋? 对
- Are you saying I'm stupid? - Yes!

1138
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,780
这是第十五次了
This is the fifteenth take.

1139
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,870
我不能这样工作嘛
I cannot work like this.

1140
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:30,870
我要回我的化妆室  我要休息
- I will be in my trailer. - I need a break.

1141
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,710
打板  哇  飞力
- Marker. - Whoa, Flik, honey.

1142
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:37,420
我们可没有意思要...谁在那里敲敲打打的?
We are not about to... Is someone hammering?

1143
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,500
拜托等一下再敲好不好?
Can we hold the work, please? People!

1144
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,800
你们可以看到我  对不对?
Am... Am I in this shot? You can... You can see me, right?

1145
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,590
好  开始
And... action.

1146
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,220
飞向宇宙宇宙  浩瀚无垠
To infinity and beyond!

1147
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,520
对不起喔  我忍不住
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1148
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,520
你不能怪我喔
Really, can y... can you blame me?

1149
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:57,360
好...那我们再来一次好不好? 好  停  对不起
- Okay. Okay, let's go for real now. - Okay, cut! - Sorry.

1150
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,690
我们干嘛回蚁岛呢?
Why go back to Ant Island at all?

1151
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,820
我是说你根本不喜欢稻谷嘛  什么
- I mean, you don't even like grain. - What?

1152
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,070
对啊  我自己也觉得这个点子不好
You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea myself.

1153
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,530
事实上  这不是我的点子...  看
- Actually, it wasn't even my idea. - Watch it!

1154
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:08,700
对不起啊  抱歉  摄影机坏了吗?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is the camera broke?

1155
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:12,080
对不起...抱歉  不好意思  我搞砸了
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did I ruin the take?

1156
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:19,420
还有  谢谢你找到他们  飞力
And, uh, thank you for findin' 'em, Flik.

1157
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:23,210
真的很痛耶   谁帮忙弄一下好不好? 对不起  哦
- This really hurts. Can we cut? - Oh, I'm sorry. - Ow!

1158
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:25,380
哦  请问你有蚂蚁太太
So, is there a Mrs Ant...

1159
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,470
等着你回家吗
you have to tunnel home to?

1160
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:32,260
噢  对不起  我以为他是真的呢
Ooh, I'm sorry. I thought he was real.

1161
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,640
把那个放进我车里吧
Oh, dear. Put that thing in my car.

1162
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,400
打板  飞力  经过仔细的考虑之后...
- Marker. - Flik, after much deliberation...

1163
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:45,700
噢...我的眼睛
Ohh, I g... Oh, my eye!

1164
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,320
哦  不不  真的  番茄汁流到我眼睛里了
Oh, no, seriously, I got berry juice in my eye!

1165
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,410
好刺眼哦  不要再拍了
It stings! Stop acting!

1166
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,660
我是说真的  哦  摄影机快停
I'm serious! Oh, stop the camera!

1167
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:58,580
毛巾啊  我这儿需要毛巾啊
Uh-oh. Towel! I need a towel over here!

1168
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,880
停
Cut!

1169
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:07,050
对不起  对不起  能够停一下吗
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. C-Can we cut?

1170
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,340
只是我觉得我演得不够好
It's just that.I...I don't think I'm comin' across.

1171
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,850
我知道...我知道了  我可以口吐白沫
Hmm. Oh, I know, I know. I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1172
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:15,930
哦...这样好  可以了  戴尔  好了  再来一次
Ooh, ooh. That's good. I got it,J.L. All right. One more for me.

1173
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,940
预备  打板
- Speed. - Marker.

1174
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:20,190
好  开始  在15秒钟之内
- Action! - Spinning a web of safety...

1175
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,480
我们要织出一个安全网...
in less than 50...

1176
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,520
这是你这辈子的机会
It's the time of your life

1177
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,480
谢谢观赏

1178
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:27,360
So live it well

1179
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:32,910
It's the time of your life

1180
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:34,990
So live it well

1181
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:42,290
We may only go round one time

1182
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,210
As far as I can tell

1183
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:48,470
It's the time of your life

1184
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:53,640
So live it well

1185
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,020
Like us all he started small

1186
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,140
Then he grew

1187
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,440
When the time came he knew

1188
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,530
What to do

1189
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:12,780
He knew in order to succeed  They'd have to work together

1190
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:16,700
He turned a rock into a seed  And they were changed forever

1191
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,250
Then they had the strength they'd need

1192
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:24,040
To get through stormy weather  Do or die, you gotta try

1193
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,210
It's the time of your life

1194
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:29,340
So live it well

1195
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,640
It's the time of your life

1196
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,720
So live it well

1197
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:44,020
You may only go round one time

1198
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:47,440
As far as I can tell  He may be wrong about that

1199
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:50,360
It's the time of your life

1200
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:53,360
So live it well

1201
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:57,410
Isn't it a bit surprising

1202
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:01,250
How our fortunes ebb and flow

1203
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:05,080
And only to the enterprising

1204
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:09,510
Does the magic fortune cookie go

1205
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:13,680
Believe me It's the time of your life

1206
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,760
So live it well

1207
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:21,270
It's the time of your life

1208
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,560
So live it well

1209
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:30,740
We may only go round one time

1210
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,570
As far as I can tell

1211
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:37,280
It's the time of your life

1212
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:41,160
It's the time of your life

1213
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:44,540
It's the time of your life

1214
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:47,090
So live it well
