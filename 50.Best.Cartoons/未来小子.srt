00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:04,347
片名：《拜见罗宾逊一家》
Meet The Robinsons

3
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,803
我没有选那个 因为那个会让我起疙瘩
Then I didn't choose that one because it was gonna give me pimples,

4
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:27,555
于是我挑了另外一个比较恐怖的
so I choosed another scary one

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,769
因为根据我多年参加 万圣节前夕的经验
because, for all those years that I went for Halloween,

6
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,604
我是比较大胆的
I wasn't scary at all.

7
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,742
我特爱棒球 我生下来就是要去打棒球的
I love baseball. It's my destiny to play that game.

8
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,828
其实我不真的那么在乎输赢
I don't really care about winning.

9
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:54,416
不过现在我挺在乎的 因为，呃，我们逢打必输
Well, like, now I do 'cause, like, we've lost every game.

10
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,459
我都输得麻木了
I've gotten tired of it.

11
00:02:56,584 --> 00:03:00,088
我是那么卖力的打 所有的球都扔给我
I'm working, like, so hard. All the balls are getting thrown to me.

12
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,632
我尽力去接住每一个球
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

13
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:06,845
场外的观众都在看着…
All of the people in the outfield are all looking around and...

14
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,597
走吧！ 我们打棒球去，好不?
Come on! Let's play some baseball, okay?

15
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,057
我们需要运动 别老呆在屋里
Not the lazy game.

16
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:20,775
他们到了
They're here.

17
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,741
刘易斯
Lewis?

18
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:30,994
刘易斯
Lewis?

19
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,589
顾博，嘿，我完成了 我做完了
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

20
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:44,299
他们将会爱死这发明
They are gonna love this!

21
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,302
没有比说“收养我吧” 更象古怪的发明了
Nothing says "adopt me" like a weird invention.

22
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,553
刘易斯
Lewis!

23
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,805
- 刘易斯，哈里顿夫妇到了 - 我先走了，米尔德里德
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here! - Way ahead of you, Mildred.

24
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,724
等等
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

25
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,935
记住，坐立时要挺直腰杆 看着他们的眼睛
Remember, sit up straight. Look them in the eye.

26
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,229
脸带微笑 让我帮你…
Smile. Let's fix your...

27
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,273
米尔德里德
Mildred.

28
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,734
好吧，好吧
All right, all right, all right, all right.

29
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,736
去向他们展现你的与众不同…
Go show them how special you are.

30
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,780
噢，希望这次能够成功
Oh, I hope this is it.

31
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,615
我希望他能被收养
I hope he gets adopted.

32
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,366
还有我也希望，头头
You and me both, chief.

33
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,829
我是指这个世界上 太多东西能够改进
I mean, there's so many things in the world that can be improved.

34
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,291
想象一下 活动式人行道，气垫汽车
Just think of it. Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

35
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,959
只有想不到，没有做不到的
The possibilities are endless.

36
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,170
气垫汽车？嘿，我喜欢这个
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

37
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,131
只要少少的想象 再加上一点点的科学
All it takes is some imagination and a little science,

38
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:27,634
我们就能让这个世界变得更美好
and we can make the world a better place.

39
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,054
呃，这些主意非常有趣
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

40
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,181
那么你最喜爱的运动是什么？
So, what's your favourite sport?

41
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,809
- 发明创造算不算一种运动？ - 事实上…
- Well, does inventing count as a sport? - Actually...

42
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,019
因为当我发明了这个 我好像打了个本垒打
'Cause I think I hit a home run with this one!

43
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,563
- 那是啥玩艺？ - 首先，得问个问题
- What is that? - First, a question.

44
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,982
当你用花生酱和果子冻 做三文治的时候
What's the number one problem that you face

45
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,818
你面对的头号难题是什么？
when you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

46
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,237
- 刘易斯，我不想… - 搭配比例控制
- Lewis, I don't think we... - Portion control.

47
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,280
太多花生酱黏住口腔顶部
Too much peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth,

48
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,490
引起咀嚼困难
takes forever to chew.

49
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:54,369
太多果子冻从三文治边上挤出来 弄得双手黏糊糊的
Too much jelly squishes out the sides and makes your hands all sticky.

50
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,122
我认为花生酱和果子冻的最佳搭配
Well, I propose that the perfect P.B. and J.

51
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:58,581
是人们随手可得的
is within mankind's grasp,

52
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:01,000
为此我发明了这部机器
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

53
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,336
在这次演示中 我使用普通的面包
For this demonstration, I'll use regular bread.

54
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,546
亲爱的，没事的
Honey, it's okay.

55
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,506
正如您所看到的 面包并不需要烤过
As you can see, toasting is an option.

56
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:08,800
我们并不吃花生酱
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

57
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,803
刘易斯，真的不需要演示了
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

58
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,680
被堵住了
It's jammed!

59
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,308
刘易斯，求你不要做了
Lewis, please, don't!

60
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:27,402
怎么回事？
What's happening?

61
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,363
哈里顿先生对花生过敏！
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

62
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:32,198
真对不起！
I'm sorry!

63
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:33,867
让我帮你弄掉那些花生酱！
Here let me help you get that off!

64
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,744
靠后站！
Stand back!

65
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,541
- 他会没事吗？ - 深呼吸，深呼吸
- Is he gonna be okay? - Breathe. Breathe.

66
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,626
真对不起，我不知道！
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

67
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:45,378
认识你真高兴
It was really nice to meet you.

68
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:48,298
我们需要一点时间考虑
We're gonna need some time to think about it.

69
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:50,592
嗨，一切还好吗…
Hi, folks. Everything all...

70
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,801
发生什么事了？
What happened?

71
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:54,387
达夫小姐 那小孩对我们绝对不合适
Miss Duffy, that boy is definitely not right for us.

72
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:55,930
现在我们告辞了
Now, if you'll excuse me.

73
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,018
我对发生这一切感到很抱歉 如果你们…
I'm so sorry about this. If you would just...

74
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:11,362
- 我做好午饭了 - 我不饿
- I made some lunch. - Not hungry.

75
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,866
可怜的哈里顿先生
Poor Mr Harrington.

76
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,536
- 我杀死他了？ - 没有，没有，你没有杀死他
- I killed him? - No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

77
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:20,622
我给他打电话了，他完全没事了
I called. He's perfectly fine.

78
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:24,084
我只是想说
I was just gonna say that it's...

79
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,877
他没有尝试一下
It's too bad he didn't get to try a sandwich

80
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,546
你的天才发明做的三文治 真是太可惜了
from that wonderful invention of yours.

81
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,757
- 对，真的太可惜了 - 这不是你的错
- Yeah, real wonderful. - It's not you.

82
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,384
我们只是还没有 找到合适的夫妇罢了
We just haven't found the right couple yet.

83
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,428
一百二十四
One hundred twenty-four.

84
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,013
什么？
What?

85
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:40,642
那是领养面试次数 我一共面试了124次
That's how many adoption interviews I've had, 124.

86
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,851
噢，刘易斯，算了吧
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

87
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:44,229
你也太夸张了 为了说明你
You're exaggerating just to make your

88
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:46,981
是对的
point.

89
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,109
另外，我明年13岁了
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

90
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:52,737
你知道一个少年被领养会有多困难
and you know how hard it is for a teenager to get adopted.

91
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:56,408
我没有未来 没有人想收养我
I have no future. No one wants me.

92
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,575
那不是真的，刘易斯！
That's not true, Lewis!

93
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,369
我亲生母亲都不想要我
My own mother didn't even want me.

94
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:01,871
好了，够了，你并不知道那原因
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

95
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,373
那么她为什么放弃我？
Then why'd she give me up?

96
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,166
她或许没有能力养大你
She may not have been able to take care of you.

97
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,793
你有没有想过这点？
Did you ever think of that?

98
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:11,714
我肯定她所考虑的是 什么是对你最好的
I am sure that she was only thinking about what was best for you.

99
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,842
我从没有从那方面去想
I never thought of it that way.

100
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,262
或许她想养育你 但她没有能力
Maybe she wanted to keep you, but she had no choice.

101
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,140
你所得对
You're right.

102
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,935
我亲生妈妈才是唯一想要我的人
My real mom is the only person who's ever wanted me.

103
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,812
慢着，我是说“或许”
Wait. I said "maybe."

104
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:28,731
如果她那时要我 现在她也会要我
And if she wanted me then, she'll want me now.

105
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:30,316
你在说些什么呀？
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:33,820
我要去找她，米尔德里德 如果我找到她，她就会要回我
I have to find her, Mildred, and when I do, she'll take me back,

107
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,321
我们一家人又再重聚了
and we'll be a family again!

108
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:39,242
哦，刘易斯，你不能找到她的
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Lewis, you can't do that.

109
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,120
没有人知道她的任何消息 没有人曾经见过她
No one knows anything about her. No one even saw her.

110
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,999
不对，我看见她了
Wrong. I saw her

111
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:47,208
一次
once.

112
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:50,962
她就在我的脑海里 我只需要记起来
She's in here. I just have to remember.

113
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,050
就这么定了
That's it!

114
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:00,889
<i>您好</i>
<i>Hello</i>

115
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,850
<i>我要告诉你一些事情</i>
<i>I got something to tell you</i>

<i>一些不可思议的事情</i>
<i>But it's crazy</i>

117

<i>我要给你看一些东西</i>
<i>I got something to show you</i>

118

119
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:18,823
<i>再多一瞥，我对你印象更深刻</i>
<i>One more glance And I will make of you</i>

120
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,452
<i>有一个信仰者</i>
<i>Another believer</i>

121
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:27,665
<i>你估不到吧？ 你获得的比你索求的还多</i>
<i>Guess what? You got more than you bargained</i>

122
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,835
<i>太神奇了吧？</i>
<i>Ain't it crazy?</i>

123
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,589
<i>你买到的比你支付的还多</i>
<i>You got more than you paid for</i>

124

00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:45,809
<i>再多一只手去牵</i>
<i>One more hand to hold</i>

127
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:52,816
<i>你已经在我脑海里</i>
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

128
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,444
<i>虽说看似戏谑 </i>
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

129
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:03,118
<i>浪费大量时间</i>
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

130
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:07,831
<i>虽说看似戏谑</i>
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

131
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,333
<i>我们将怎么办？</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

132
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,169
<i>我们将怎么办？</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

133
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:17,173
<i>我们将怎么办？</i>
<i>What are we gonna do about it?</i>

134
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,972
<i>你已经在我脑海里</i>
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

135
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,517
<i>再给一次机会</i>
<i>One more chance</i>

136
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:32,856
<i>浪费大量时间</i>
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

137
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,318
<i>再给一次机会</i>
<i>One more chance</i>

138
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:40,613
累坏了
So tired.

139
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:45,994
我们下午两点见 你要来他会很高兴的
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon. He'll be so excited you're coming.

140
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,412
再见了
Bye-bye, now.

141
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:51,124
好极了！ 嘿，顾博…呃，是迈克尔
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

142
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:53,293
- 祝你今天的大赛好运！ - 轻而易举的事情
- Good luck at the big game today. - Easy win.

143
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,462
对方是一群乌合之众
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

144
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:57,672
我只希望我不要睡着了
I just hope I can stay awake.

145
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,674
不要告诉我，让我猜猜
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

146
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,553
他整晚没睡 一直在搞他那该死的发明
He was up all night working on his stupid project,

147
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:05,388
但是我早就有心理准备了
but that's what happens

148
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,767
当你有这么一个科学怪人做室友
when you get a science geek for a roommate.

149
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:17,066
哈，真是好人
Ah, that's good joe.

150
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:21,446
好了，爱恩斯坦 你该去为迈克尔加油
All right, Einstein, you owe Michael big time.

151
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,574
把脑海里的秘密打开 需要的时间要比我预期的长
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain took a lot longer than I expected,

152
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:27,786
但是已经完成了，米尔德里德 我再校准了耳机
but it's finished, Mildred. I recalibrated the headset.

153
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,580
现在神经中枢的线路将会接通
Now the neural circuits will connect.

154
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,582
我破解了脑内的海马状突起 （在泛记过程中起主要作用）
I've cracked the hippocampus!

155
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,584
真的吗？好的，什么？
Really? Okay. What?

156
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,503
现在开始测试
Now to test it out.

157
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,341
噢，我要迟到了，我得走了！
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

158
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,550
等一下，刘易斯，等一下
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

159
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,344
我差点忘了我到这的目的
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

160
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,845
我知道你今天有很多事情要做
I know you have a lot on your plate today,

161
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,264
但我已经为你安排了一次会面 在下午
but I've scheduled an interview for you this afternoon.

162
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,266
- 不，谢谢 - “不，谢谢”？什么意思？
- No, thanks. - "No, thanks"?

163
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:52,268
宝贝，这是关乎你被收养的大事
Sweetheart, this is about being adopted,

164
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:55,396
你得回来这里 而且要干净，高兴还有准时
and you will be back here clean, happy and on time.

165
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:59,317
我不再去会面了，米尔德里德 我不要再被拒绝了
I'm done with interviews, Mildred. I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

166
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,736
听着，我知道你的想法 但我还是要提醒你
Listen, I know where your head is, but I'm telling you,

167
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,573
你得忘记过去 展望未来
you have got to get out of the past and look to the future.

168
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,617
我有，这就是了
I am, and this is it.

169
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:08,952
这就是我的未来
This is my future.

170
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,538
对不起
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,040
刘易斯？宝贝？
Lewis? Honey?

172
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:21,131
克伦克霍恩博士 我知道你在发明谷实验室
Dr Krunklehorn, I know you're very busy there

173
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:22,340
忙得不可开交
at Inventco Labs,

174
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:24,426
我们非常荣幸能邀请到您担任裁判
and we're just so excited to have you as a judge.

175
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,469
非常乐意帮忙，威勒斯坦先生 嘿，你可能还不知道
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein. Hey, you never know.

176
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,638
你的一位学生可能发明了 下一代的集成电路
One of your students may invent the next integrated circuit

177
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:30,807
或者微处理器 或者集成电路

178
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,350
噢，慢着 我已经提过集成电路了
Oh, wait! I said that already.

179
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,269
我很少离开那实验室
Well, I just don't get out of that lab very much.

180

我有八天没有睡了
I haven't slept in eight days!

182
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:41,317
那么需要我帮你找张简易床 或其他什么的？
Well, then can I get you a cot or something?

183
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:44,446
不需要，我已经打过咖啡因补丁 这是我的发明
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch. It's my invention.

184
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,198
每个补丁相当于12杯咖啡
Each patch is the equivalent of 12 cups of coffee.

185
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:49,743
你能够保持清醒数天 而没有任何副作用
You can stay awake for days with no side effects.

186
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,953
对不起，她是谁？
Sorry. Who's this?

187
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,706
她是我的学生 斯坦利・普郭斯基
This is one of our students, Stanley Pukowski.

188
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,458
噢，太可爱了
Oh, so cute!

189
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,960
我真想咬一口 他那胖胖的小脸颊！
I just want to bite his chubby little cheeks!

190
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,381
衣服上的是什么，普郭斯基？
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

191
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:06,050
事实上这是宽外袍，先生
It's actually a toga, sir.

192
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,637
教练，见到你真高兴，有那么一点点 你在这干什么？
Coach, nice to see you, sort of. What are you doing here?

193
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,223
当科学展览的裁判啊 我看起来还会做什么？
Judging a science fair. What's it look like I'm doing?

194
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,351
什么让您觉得 您够资格当科学展的裁判的？
And what makes you qualified to judge a science fair?

195
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:16,728
这是我的地盘

00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,314
斯坦利 火山爆发吧
Stanley. Volcano.

197
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:24,944
见证维苏威火山（欧洲唯一活火山） 的神奇力量吧
Behold the awesome power of Mount Vesuvius!

198
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:31,117
触发器不工作
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

199
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:32,327
克伦克霍恩博士？
Dr Krunklehorn?

200
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,454
钡，钴（化学元素） 爱恩斯坦，调味剂
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

201
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:38,541
我不知道她刚才在说什么 但这项目不通过！
I don't know what she just said, but this project is unacceptable!

202
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,376
现在给我环绕体育馆跑20个圈！
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

203
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:42,003
快跑！快跑！快跑！ 快！快！快！
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

204
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,838
- 教练 - 我在看着你
- Coach! - I'm watching you.

205
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:56,351
好了，下一位是莉兹和她的 火蚁（南美一种杂食性蚂蚁）养殖场
Okay, next up is Lizzy and her fire ant farm.

206
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,644
没错
That's right.

207
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,229
莉兹，我们谈论过这火蚁
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

208
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:01,189
你知道他们会咬人
You know that they have a tendency to bite people.

209
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,566
他们只咬我的敌人
Only my enemies.

210
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,945
不要停，好不？ 莉兹，你是最棒的
Just keep moving, shall we? Top notch, Lizzy!

211
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,823
我们还是不要惹她生气 或者有任何引起她不安的举动
Let's not anger her or make her jumpy in any way.

212
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,463
这里不安全，进来
This area's not secure. Get in.

213
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:29,217
有没有一个戴圆顶硬礼帽 的高个子男人靠近你？
Have you been approached by a tall man in a bowler hat?

214
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,553
- 什么？ - 嘿，嘿，在这我来问问题
- What? - Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

215
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,180
- 好吧，再见 - 好吧
- Okay, goodbye. - All right,

216
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:36,349
本不想以大欺小 这是你逼我的
didn't want to pull rank on you, but you forced my hand.

Now, tall man, bowler hat, approached you?

221
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:45,817
没有，为什么？
No, why?

222
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:48,319
我会因为这而丢掉工作的
I could lose my badge for this.

223
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:50,155
他是一宗抢劫案的嫌疑犯
He's a suspect in a robbery.

224
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,364
他偷了什么了？
What did he steal?

225
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:52,782
- 一部时光机器 - 一部什么？
- A time machine. - A what?

226
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:56,035
我一直追踪他到了这个时光点 我的线人说他在找你
I've tracked him to this time, and my informants say he's after you.

227
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:57,829
找我？为什么找我？
Me? Why me?

228
00:13:57,954 --> 00:13:59,914
在HQ的小伙子还没有找到他的动机
The boys back at HQ haven't figured out a motive yet.

229
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,000
我说的“HQ”是指总部的意思
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

230
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,460
我知道HQ是什么意思
I know what HQ means.

231
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,128
很好，你是个聪明的孩子
Good. You're a smart kid.

232
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:07,297
这或许能让你活着 到目前为止
That might keep you alive, for now.

233
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:08,965
只是有点担心你那小发明
Just worry about your little science gizmo

234
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,217
让我来当那个“perp”（罪人）

235
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:14,095
- 我说的“perp”是指… - 我知道那是什么意思！

238
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,900
我的青蛙！
My frogs!

239
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,276
这下你可逃不掉了
You're not gonna get away with it,

240
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:32,072
带着科学展品的小孩
kid with science project.

241
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,824
靓仔，你差点打烂了我的太阳能系统！
Dude, you almost busted my solar system!

242
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,620
我的青蛙！ 他们跑掉了！
My frogs! They're getting away!

243
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,153
抓到你了！ 这是最后一只
Got you! That's the last of them.

244
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,614
讨厌的小女孩 我可没有时间抓青蛙
Annoying little girl, I don't have time for this.

245
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:15,824
我正在执行重要的…
I'm on a very important...

246
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,160
对本小姐休得无礼，孩子 我会日本空手道
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

247
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,330
加油，普郭斯基！ 小小的苦楚相当于激励！
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain! Love the pain!

248
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,581
教练…
Coach...

249
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,833
下一个是刘易斯
Next up is Lewis.

250
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,127
对…刘易斯！ 失陪一下
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

251
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,629
刘易斯，告诉我这玩艺不会…
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

252
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:34,342
没事的，这次准会成功 我不会让您失望的，我保证
It's okay. It's gonna work this time. I won't let you down, I promise.

253
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,387
好吧，刘易斯，我相信你 给他们致命一击
All right, Lewis, I trust you. Knock 'em dead.

254
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:40,849
那是给大家一个惊喜的意思 千万不要闹出人命来
That was a figure of speech. Please don't kill anyone.

255
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,188
好了，大家往后站
Okay, stand back, everybody.

256
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,983
下一个项目会 让大家张大嘴巴合不拢
This next project will knock your socks off.

257
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,819
说真的，你可能需要站后一点
Seriously, you might wanna stand back a little.

258
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,072
你是否曾经忘记过一些事情
Have you ever forgotten something,

259
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:59,701
无论你如何努力去回想 就是想不起来
and no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't remember it?

260
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:03,747
这些被遗忘了的记忆到底去哪了？
Well, what happens to these forgotten memories?

261
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:07,333
我认为它们被存放在 我们脑海里的某个角落
I propose they're stored somewhere in your brain,

262
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,044
我建造了一台机器可以唤醒它们
and I built a machine that can retrieve them.

263
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,089
我称它记忆扫描仪
I call it the Memory Scanner.

264
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,341
让人眼前为之一亮！
It's shiny!

265
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,136
那么，刘易斯 这台记忆扫描仪的工作原理是什么？
So, Lewis, how does the Memory Scanner work?

266
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:21,639
首先，你在这键盘输入想扫描的时间段
First, you input the desired period of time on this keypad.

267
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:26,102
然后镭射扫描大脑皮层 那是记忆被存放的地方
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex, where memories are stored.

268
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,688
被提取出来的记忆会 被显示在显示屏上
The retrieved memory is then displayed on this monitor.

269
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,732
把它打包起来 我要两台
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

270
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,444
现在我设定时间倒退 12年零3个月11天
Now, I'm going back 12 years, three months and 11 days.

271
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:36,446
为什么要选这个特定的日子？
Why that particular day?

272
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,531
我没有想到我会注意到吧？
You didn't think I was paying attention, did you?

273
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,327
呃，那天是…
Well, that was the day...

274
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,456
这么说吧 那天是我生命中很重要的一天
Let's just say, that was a very important day in my life.

275
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:48,124
比较合理 开始吧
Fair enough. Play ball.

276
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,795
涡轮很快就能发动起来
It'll just take a second to get the turbines going.

277
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:11,981
刘易斯，慢着！
Lewis, wait!

278
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:24,786
她要爆发了！
She's gonna blow!

279
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:27,914
注意！
Watch out!

280
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,003
小小苦楚相当于激励…
Feel the pain! Love the...

281
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:36,172
很疼！快停止！
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

282
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,346
快停止！
Make it stop!

283
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:44,806
教练，你忍住，好吧？
Coach, suck it up, okay?

284
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,351
让我们处理好危机 明天我们回想起也感自豪
Let us conduct ourselves in a way that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

285
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:50,270
- 大家冷静！ - 威勒斯坦先生？
- Let's calm down! - Mr 威勒斯坦?

286
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:51,980
- 我不是故意的… - 现在不是时候，刘易斯！
- I didn't mean to... - Not now, Lewis!

287
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,732
对不起，真对不起
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

288
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,359
现在不是道歉的时候
Not now.

289
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:00,530
好吧，大家冷静有秩序地
Okay, and we are walking in a calm, orderly fashion

290
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:01,740
走向出口
toward the exits.

291
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:07,787
等等，刘易斯！
Wait, Lewis!

292
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:29,267
来，亲爱的，我们的未来在等着呢
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

293
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,184
嘿，你在这干嘛？
Hey, what are you doing up here?

294
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,910
你能不再扮了吗，拜托了？ 我知道你不是鸽子
Would you quit that, please? I know you're not a pigeon.

295
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,455
你让我暴露了
You're blowing my cover.

296
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,165
这里只有我们两个
We're the only ones up here.

297
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,250
这正是他们希望你是这样想的
That's just what they want you to think.

298
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,960
现在，那里该打扫好了
Now, enough moping.

299
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,005
把这个拿回科学展 修好你的记忆扫描仪
Take this back to the science fair and fix that Memory Scanner.

300
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,007
停！停！离我远点！
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

301
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,175
也许你忘记了
Maybe you've forgotten.

302
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,844
我是来自未来的时光警察 应该被非常严肃的对待
I'm a time cop from the future, should be taken very seriously.

303
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,096
这不是徽章
That's no badge.

304
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,516
这是皮肤晒成褐色沙龙赠券！ 你是个假冒的
This is a coupon for a tanning salon! You're a fake.

305
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:35,685
好吧，你揭穿了我 我不是警察
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

306
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,771
但我确实是来自未来
but I really am from the future,

307
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:39,856
还有确实有这么一个 戴圆顶硬礼帽的家伙
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

308
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:41,191
又来了
Here we go again.

309
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,234
他偷了一部时光机器 来到了科学展
He stole a time machine, came to the science fair

310
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,444
破坏掉你的发明
and ruined your project.

311
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,863
我的发明不成功 是因为我功夫不到家
My project didn't work because I'm no good.

312
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:49,491
没有戴圆顶硬礼帽的家伙 没有时光机器
There is no Bowler Hat Guy, there is no time machine,

313
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,201
你并不是来自未来
and you're not from the future!

314
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:52,368
你是疯了！
You're crazy!

315
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:54,287
我没有发疯
I am not crazy.

316
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,748
噢，对了，时光旅行队长？ 证明你所说的
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel? Prove it.

317
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,210
对了吧，我猜对了吧 你无法证明
Yeah, that's what I thought.

318
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:03,171
我要反锁自己在我的房间里
I'm just gonna go lock myself in my room

319
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,215
躲在掩盖物下面好几年
and hide under the covers for a couple years.

320
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,676
如果我证明我来自未来 你会不会回到科学展去？
If I prove to you I'm from the future, will you go back to the science fair?

321
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,012
好，当然，你想怎样都行
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

322
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:13,056
嘿，放开我
Hey, let go of me!

323
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,225
- 你在干嘛？放开我！ - 好吧
- What are you doing? Let go of me! - Okay.

324
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,622
这是什么？我们要上哪去？
What is this? Where are we going?

325
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,083
去到未来！
To the future!

326
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:02,730
<i>已经到达未来</i>
<i>The future has arrived</i>

327
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:06,484
<i>今天已经到达未来</i>
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

328
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,945
<i>已经到达未来</i>
<i>The future has arrived</i>

329
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,824
<i>今天已经到达未来</i>
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

330
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:55,241
这个证据充足了吧？
Is this proof enough for you?

331
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,951
够充足了！
Is it ever!

332
00:22:57,077 --> 00:23:00,080
在我一生中我从来没有 想象到时光旅行会实现
I never thought that time travel could be possible in my lifetime,

333
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,624
现在就在我的眼前
and here it is, right in front of me!

334
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,501
事实会让你相信一切 老兄
The truth will set you free, brother.

335
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:07,504
这一切超出了我的想象
This is beyond anything I could've imagined.

336
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:10,507
这意味着我完全可以改变我的生命
This means I could really change my life.

337
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:12,008
对，你能够
That's right. You can.

338
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,469
下一站是科学展 去修好你的记忆扫描仪
Next stop, science fair, to fix your Memory Scanner.

339
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,347
嘿，我才不会去修那愚蠢的记忆扫描仪
Hey, I'm not gonna fix that stupid Memory Scanner.

340
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:21,017
- 什么？ - 威尔伯，这是时光机器！
- What? - Wilbur, this is a time machine!

341
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:22,852
为什么我要去修理我那低级的发明
Why should I fix my dumb invention

342
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:26,397
什么时候你能带我去见我的妈妈？ 就用这船
when you can take me to see my mom now in this ship?

343
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:32,195
事实上我可以回到那个晚上 制止她不要遗弃我
I could actually go back to that night and stop her from giving me up.

344
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,156
答案不是时光机器 而是这个
The answer is not a time machine. It's this.

345
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,617
这个？你想知道我对这个的看法吗？
This? You want to know what I think about this?

346
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:38,868
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

347
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,161
对不起，威尔伯
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

348
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,122
但你不知道我是怎样熬过来的
but you don't know what I've lived through.

349
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:44,040
- 刘易斯，不要！ - 松手！
- Lewis, no! - Let go!

350
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,042
- 你松手！ - 你不是我的老板！
- You let go! - You're not the boss of me!

351
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,337
我是的 因为我13岁，你才12岁
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

352
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,839
我比你大
That makes me older.

353
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:52,048
我在过去出生
Well, I was born in the past,

354
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:54,217
所以我比你老，你要听我的！
which makes me older and the boss of you!

355
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:14,237
我完蛋了
I am so dead.

356
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:18,533
我不允许看一眼这玩艺 更不要说驾驶它了！
I'm not allowed to look at this thing, let alone drive it!

357
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,034
爸爸，妈妈要杀了我了
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

358
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,912
我可以明确告诉你 他们绝不会手软的
and I can tell you this. It will not be done with mercy.

359
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,706
难道没有时光机器修理店
Isn't there like a time machine repair shop

360
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:25,874
- 或其他类似的？ - 没有
- or something? - No!

361
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,084
目前总共才有两台时光机器
There's only two time machines in existence,

362
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:30,003
另一台在戴圆顶硬礼帽的家伙手上
and the Bowler Hat Guy has the other one!

363
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:32,589
那么得找人修好它
Well, somebody's gonna have to fix this.

364
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:35,759
好主意 你这么聪明，你来修
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

365
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:38,303
你疯了吗？我不会修这玩艺
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

366
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:40,972
你行的 你弄坏了，你得修好
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

367
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:44,267
好吧，不过有个条件
All right, under one condition.

368
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:47,353
我修好了 你带我回去见我的妈妈
I fix it, you take me back to see my mom.

369
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,398
什么？你甚至没有兑现我们上一个协议
What? You didn't even follow through on our last deal.

370
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,608
这叫我如何相信你？
How can I trust you?

371
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:54,444
那么你告诉我 你是来自未来的时光警察
Well, you told me you were a time cop from the future.

372
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,279
这叫我如何相信你？
How can I trust you?

373
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,114
大家彼此彼此
<i>Touch?</i>

374
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,785
那么我们达成协议了吧？
So do we have a deal?

375
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,943
这位女士你好
Good day, madam.

376
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:38,530
- 我是来这改变未来的 - 是的，先生？
- I'm here to change the future. - Yes, sir?

377
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:42,492
我需要马上跟主管谈谈
I must speak with the man in charge immediately.

378
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:45,870
- 是，先生 - 我和命运有个约会
- Yes, sir. - I have an appointment with destiny.

379
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,664
很好，先生 我要告诉史密斯
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

380
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:49,999
我会把你干洗好的衣服 直接送回到你的套间
and I'll have your dry cleaning delivered directly to your suite.

381
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,168
- 什么？ - 现在告诉我你的预约时间？
- What? - Now, what time is your appointment?

382
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:56,172
- 你在问我吗？ - 是的
- Are you talking to me? - Yes.

383
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:57,966
你的预约时间是几点？
What time is your appointment?

384
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:03,430
大指针在…噢，两点！
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

385
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,181
你是预约两点的那位？
You're the 2:00?

386
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,350
对，就是我
Yes. Yes, I am.

387
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,227
你是玛丽・约翰森？
You're Mary Johnson?

388
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,688
对
Yes.

389
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,441
玛丽是什么的简称…
Mary is short for...

390
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:16,526
玛丽安？
Marian?

391
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:19,529
- 那可以是个男孩的名字吗？ - 可以的
- Can that be a boy name? - Yes.

392
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:22,157
- 那么是的 - 请坐下
- Then yes. - Have a seat.

393
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,658
噢，太好了
Oh, goody!

394
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:38,381
“把发明冒认是自己的作品” 完成，噢，我喜欢清单
"Pass off invention as my own." Check. Oh, I love checklists.

395
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,133
管委会的人已经准备好见你
The board is ready to see you now.

396
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:43,595
等等，我该说些什么？
Wait. What am I going to say?

397
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,598
我永远都记不住那些
I'm never gonna remember that.

398
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:50,101
你能不能…为什么你不自己去？ 你做得比我好多了
Would you... Why don't you go? You do it so much better than me.

399
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:52,437
那是事实
That's true.

400
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:55,231
没有脑袋的帽子不可能真的
A hat without a head couldn't really pass off an invention

401
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:56,441
冒认别人的发明
as its own.

402
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:01,821
妙极了！好主意！ 真高兴有你帮忙！
Fantastic! Great idea! I'm so glad I have you!

403
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:11,581
“准备好一个惊喜” 噢，我看到了
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

404
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:15,585
准备好一个惊喜！
Prepare to be amazed!

405
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:20,757
“这是我的发明”
"This is my invention."

406
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:24,928
“我想在座各位从来没有 看过如此伟大的发明”
"I doubt any of you have seen anything as brilliant as this device."

407
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:26,096
非常好
Very well,

408
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,431
约翰森小姐？
Miss Johnson?

409
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:30,475
是太太
It's Ms.

410
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,186
你有两分钟时间，请开始
You have two minutes. Please begin.

411
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,193
- 光彩夺目！ - 那是什么？
- It's shiny! - What is that thing?

412
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:44,864
呃，我叫它为…
Well, I like to call it my...

413
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,866
叫它…
To call it my...

414
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:51,162
- 你在看什么？ - 没有！我…阳光照到我眼睛
- What are you looking at? - No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

415
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:53,081
那我关上百叶窗
Well, then let me close the blinds.

416
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,797
什么名字？
Now, the name?

417
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,882
呃…
Well, what...

418
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:04,676
我们可以另找个时间 讨论这名字问题
We can quibble about names at a later date.

419
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:07,554
重点是 我带来的是特别的唯一的
The point is, what I have here is special, unique.

420
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,015
对，对，你会爱死它 购买它和大量生产它
Yes. Yes, you must love it and buy it and mass produce it,

421
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:15,019
最妙的一点是 它带有非常舒服的耳机
and the best part is, it's got really comfy headphones.

422
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:22,402
我在想 你能够往前靠一点吗？拜托
I wonder, could you lean forward just a little bit, please?

423
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,320
对，谢谢
Yes, thank you.

424
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,073
对，它们相当舒服
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

425
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:29,617
你发明这目的是为了什么？
What do you hope to accomplish with this?

426
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,369
噢，没有特别的原因
Oh, nothing of consequence.

427
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:36,249
我只是想粉碎一个可怜小孤儿的梦想！
I simply wish to crush the dreams of a poor little orphan boy!

428
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,878
接下来就不太清楚
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

429
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,713
你的意思是 你并没有全盘考虑过
You mean, you haven't thought this through?

430
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:44,007
30秒
Thirty seconds.

431
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:50,388
请允许我演示 它是如何工作的
Allow me to show you how it works.

432
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:52,557
首先，我们接通电源
First, we turn it on.

433
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:57,520
那不是开关
That's not it.

434
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:00,482
10秒
Ten seconds.

435
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,586
那我该在哪签名？
So where do I sign?

436
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,802
多里斯，一切都完了
Doris, it's all over.

437
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,887
我们所有的希望和梦想都破灭了
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

438
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:40,725
就像这所有的支离破碎的机器部件
like so many pieces of a broken machiney thing.

439
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:42,685
你是对的
You're right.

440
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,564
胜利还是属于我们的
Success is still ours for the taking.

441
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:50,901
我们必须找到那小孩
We must find that boy.

442
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:58,409
我们把这玩艺偷运到车库去 在那你需要的任何工具都有
We'll sneak this thing into the garage. You'll have all the tools you need.

443
00:29:58,534 --> 00:29:59,577
那么你的父母怎办？
What about your parents?

444
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:00,828
妈妈从来不到那去
Mom never goes in there,

445
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:03,039
爸爸出差去了 明早才回来
and Dad's on a business trip until tomorrow morning.

446
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:04,206
你得赶在那之前修好它
You've got till then to fix it.

447
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:07,501
那好吧，但我需要一些 图纸或其他的一些东西
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need some blueprints or something for this.

448
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:09,962
这个不用担心 我有人会帮我们找到那些东西
No worries. I got someone who could help us with that.

449
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,926
<i>何方神圣胆敢侵犯我的领地？</i>
<i>Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?</i>

450
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:18,095
卡尔，是我，让我进去
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

451
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,390
<i>没有人能够进去 除非他们说出正确密码</i>
<i>None may enter unless they speak the royal password.</i>

452
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,934
卡尔，你在说啥呀？ 我们没有密码
Carl, what are you talking about? We don't have a password.

453
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,355
<i>我们有个密码 你离开后我设置了一个</i>
<i>Yes, we do. I made one up while you were gone.</i>

454
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,607
那我怎么会知道密码是什么？
Well, then how am I supposed to know what it is?

455
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:31,067
<i>呃…</i>
<i>You...</i>

456
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:33,861
<i>你说的对</i>
<i>Good point.</i>

457
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,948
欢迎回来，小兄弟
Welcome back, little buddy.

458
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,618
那台被偷的时光机器怎么啦？
So what's up with the stolen time machine?

459
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:43,287
你找到没有？显然没有
Did you find it? Apparently not,

460
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:46,040
你把这台也弄坏了
and you managed to bust this one as well.

461
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,708
爸爸回来前这台会被修好的
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

462
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,378
你怎么可能实现…
And how do you suppose that's gonna...

463
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,546
- 他是谁？ - 哇，真正的机器人！
- Who's that? - Wow, a real robot!

464
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,798
嗨，我是刘易斯
Hi, I'm Lewis.

465
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,306
真是出人意表
Well, that was unexpected.

466
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,475
怎么啦？
As was that.

467
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,103
如果我家人察觉 我把你从过去带到这
If my family finds out I brought you from the past,

468
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:09,313
他们会把我活埋了 然后在我的坟墓上跳舞
they'll bury me alive and dance on my grave.

469
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:12,483
我并没有夸张，呃，其实是有点 不过这不是问题所在
I'm not exaggerating. Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

470
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,819
问题是 你的头发暴露你的来历
The point is, your hair's a dead giveaway.

471
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,654
为什么我的头发会暴露我的来历？
Why would my hair be a dead giveaway?

472
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,489
问得太好了
That is an excellent question.

473
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:20,074
等一下，你要上哪去？
Wait! Where are you going?

474
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:21,659
又一个绝妙的问题
Another excellent question.

475
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:25,121
但我不想只是坐在这
But I don't just want to sit here.

476
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:26,664
留在这
Stay.

477
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:27,999
但…
But...

478
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:44,932
哇！
Wow!

479
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:52,356
嘿，按我的门铃
Hey, ring my doorbell.

480
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,858
不，不，不 按我的门铃
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

481
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:56,068
快按，快按，快按 看着这个门铃，快按
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it. Look at this door bell. Ring it.

482
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,197
- 对了！ - 纯属意外
- Yes! - That was accidental.

483
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,782
那是不小心按的门铃 不算数
That's an accidental ring. It doesn't count.

484
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:03,034
这是手册规定的 去查查看
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

485
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,618
- 小平头 - 矮冬瓜
- Flat head. - Short roots.

486
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:05,786
常青藤
Evergreen.

487
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:13,294
不要让家人知道？ 你的意思是什么？
What do you mean, don't go to the family?

488
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,131
在这家族危机的时刻 如何能够对家人隐瞒？
How can we not go to the family in this time of family crisis?

489
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:20,926
打从不锁上车库门 时光机器因此被偷
By leaving the garage door unlocked, you let the time machine get stolen,

490
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:23,929
到现在整个时光流有可能被改变！
and now the entire time stream could be altered!

491
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,723
这令我忧心如焚啊
That and someone took my bike.

492
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:28,559
我告诉过你 一切都会迎刃而解
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

493
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,437
首先，我们把刘易斯留在车库 不让其他人接触到他
First, we keep Lewis in the garage, away from everybody.

494
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:33,481
我出现给他来个世纪感言 鼓舞士气
I show up and give him the pep talk of the century.

495
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:35,066
然后他会修好时光机器
Then he fixes the time machine.

496
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,942
怎么会是个橡实?
Why is it an acorn?

497
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,778
我没时间去雕刻所有的东西
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

498
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,905
好了，现在时光机器会被修好
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

499
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,615
他在发明创造的信心会恢复
His confidence in inventing is restored.

500
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,201
他回到科学展 修好他的记忆扫描仪
He goes back to the science fair, fixes his Memory Scanner,

501
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,244
因此恢复空间－时间连续流体系
thus restoring the space-time continuum.

502
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,121
那么带他去见他妈妈又怎么办？
What about taking him back to see his mom?

503
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,082
我只是跟他这么说 以便赢得时间
I just told him that to buy some time.

504
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:54,543
噢，对，从你的脸上没看到这点
Oh, yeah, can't see that one blowing up in your face.

505
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:56,420
相信我，一切都在我掌握中
Trust me. I got it under control.

506
00:32:56,545 --> 00:32:58,631
威尔伯 罗宾逊从来没有失手过
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

507
00:33:00,883 --> 00:33:02,635
但是有一丝极微的可能性我会…
But on the slight chance that I do...

508
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,930
“一丝极微的可能性”，对 你知道吧？我运算一下
"On the slight chance," yeah. You know what? I'll run the numbers.

509
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:10,935
怎么啦？
What is it?

510
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,770
呃，不是…
Well, it's not...

511
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:17,984
这不适于任何事情… 你知道，没这必要…
It doesn't pertain to anything in... You know, there's not necessarily...

512
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:22,947
有99.999999％可能性你将不会存在
There's a 99.999999% chance that you won't exist.

513
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:26,450
- 什么？ - 我本不想告诉你，但我说了
- What? - And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

514
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:27,952
我不会存在？
I won't exist?

515
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:29,578
那我又会在哪？
And where does that leave me?

516
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:31,998
孤独的呆在某角落生锈
Alone, rusting in a corner.

517
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,961
我担心那么多干嘛？ 图纸在哪？
What am I worried about? Now, blueprints?

518
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:44,051
如果这事情结束了 我真的要摆脱你
If this thing ever blows over, I really gotta get away from you

519
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,469
好好的静一静
and get some quiet time.

520
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,016
什么…
What's...

521
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,393
嘿，小家伙！
Well, hey, there, little fella!

522
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:56,230
现在我知道你在想什么 就是我的衣服没有在后面
Now, I know what you're thinking, and my clothes are not on backwards.

523
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:57,898
但是我的头在后面！
My head is!

524
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:02,194
我过去常常告诉我的科学课学生
Oh, I used to tell that one to my science students.

525
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:04,822
他们也不笑
They didn't laugh, either.

526
00:34:04,947 --> 00:34:06,991
无论是谁，你叫什么名字，水果头?
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

527
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:09,160
- 刘易斯，但… - 刘易斯吗？
- Well, Lewis, but... - Lewis, huh?

528
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:12,371
嘿，刘易斯 你在附近没有见到过一只牙齿，是吧？
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen any teeth around here, have you?

529
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,123
- 牙齿？ - 对，我的牙齿
- Teeth? - Yeah, my teeth.

530
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:17,835
挖了一整天的洞 任何地方都没有找到
Been digging holes all day. Can't find them anywhere.

531
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,087
好了，老汉 我得回到车库去
All right, look, old man, I need to get back to the garage.

532
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:21,297
威尔伯把我留在那里
Wilbur left me down there,

533
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:22,715
我并不打算离开那 还有这些怪物…
and I wasn't supposed to leave, and these monsters...

534
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,883
- 怪物？ - …在门廊袭击我…
- Monsters? ... attacked me on the porch and...

535
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,885
在门廊没有怪物啊 笨蛋
There's no monsters on the porch, you ninny.

536
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,553
- 听我说！ - 当然，同样的我并不认为
- Listen to me! - Of course, I also didn't think

537
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:29,305
在我手臂住着只美洲旱獭
there was a woodchuck living on my arm,

538
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,890
嘿，你看！
and lookie there!

539
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,058
希望他没有携带狂犬病菌
Hope he ain't got rabies.

540
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:34,352
老头，我要回去车库！
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

541
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:38,356
一定，我马上带你到那 我有捷径
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy. I know a shortcut.

542
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:40,441
欢迎光临车库
Welcome to the garage.

543
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,610
我完全迷路了
Well, I'm completely lost.

544
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:43,819
您好，爷爷
Hiya, Grandpa.

545
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:45,029

刘易斯和我在找车库
Lewis and me are looking for the garage.

547
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:49,075
- 我们有个车库吗？ - 很明显是的
- We have a garage? - Apparently so.

548
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,535
刘易斯，能帮我一下 帮我记时吗？
Lewis, will you give me a hand and time my race?

549
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:55,539
好的，加斯顿 我的玩具火车准备好跟你比赛了
Okay, Gaston, my toy train's ready for you.

550

That's a toy train?

551
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:04,965
各就各位，准备，跑
On your mark, get set, go?

552

好吧，刘易斯 我拿到图纸了
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

554
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:17,061
刘易斯？

<i>- And five and six and seven and eight. - That's Uncle Joe. He works out.</i>

<i>把腹部的脂肪除掉</i>
<i>Keep those tummies tucked.</i>

557
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,568
这不是车库
This isn't the garage.

558
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,736
我知道
I know.

559
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:28,239
我也不认为车库会在里面
I don't think the garage is in here, either.

560
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:31,033
哎呀！确实是很严重的事情
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

561
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:33,703
- 那是阿特叔叔 - 一位真正的超级英雄？
- That's Uncle Art. - A real superhero?

562
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:35,746
四号舱，阿尔法，欧米加星系
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

563
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,165
需要一个大奶酪香肠薄面包皮的 （披萨）？

564
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,669

I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

请不要只是说 “保持奋勇前进”

那是我爸爸的座右铭

为什么他的座右铭会是 “保持奋勇前进”？

他是那样做的

老弟，你的头那样子 我认真不起来

现在把他诱出房屋
Now, to lure him out of the house.

我不知道怎样变鸭子
I don't know how to do that.

742

我并不需要一只鸭子
I don't really need a duck.

噢，好主意
Oh, good idea.

788
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,743
那样我们就能看见他是不是 有家族遗传的额前翘起的一绺头发
Then we can see if he has the family cowlick.

789
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:24,205

He can't, because he's got bad hat-hair.

790

北蒙大纳人才不会在乎 自己的“帽子头发”

好了，各位，约束一下自己

794
00:47:32,004 --> 00:47:33,214
刘易斯，你介意吗？
Lewis, do you mind?

795
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:35,675
我恐怕（你不给他们看） 他们不会就此罢休的

别害羞
Now, don't be shy.

00:47:38,552 --> 00:47:41,055
- 这里我们都是一家人 - 准备，瞄准，开火！

当然，你一定能够做的更好
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

800

令人刮目相看啊，小妹

801
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:56,654
你的能力很强 但还没强到足以跟我抗衡

你的话吓唬不了我的，大哥

803
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:02,743
那就废话少说 现在正式开战吧
Then enough words. Now the real battle begins.

804
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:15,256
你的肉丸对我毫无作用
Your meatballs are useless against me.

805
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:18,968
那么也许该到 意大利辣香肠上场了
Then perhaps it's time for spicy Italian sausage!

806
00:48:19,093 --> 00:48:20,261
不！
No!

807
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,231
这就对了 我做到了
That's right. I did it.

808
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:33,941
每天的晚饭都这样吗？
Is dinner like this every night?

809
00:48:34,066 --> 00:48:35,860
不是，昨天我们吃肉卷
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

810
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:43,784
好了，大伙儿 现在上第二道菜
Okay, gang, time for the second course.

811
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:48,247
还有什么比花生酱与果子冻 和肉丸搭配更好的呢？
And what goes better with meatballs than P.B. and J?

812
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:51,375
嘿，那个好像…
Hey, that's just like...

愚蠢的…
Stupid...

卡尔？
Carl?

815
00:48:58,132 --> 00:48:59,175
一切还好吗？
Is everything all right?

816
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,887
我们碰到一些缺陷
We're just experiencing bugs.

817
00:49:04,805 --> 00:49:06,307

Just what the doctor ordered.

818
00:49:07,016 --> 00:49:09,310
我朋友刘易斯是个发明家 他能修好
My friend Lewis is an inventor. He can fix it.

819
00:49:09,435 --> 00:49:10,978
威尔伯，你知道我不行
Wilbur, you know I can't.

820
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:12,855
来吧，试试看
Come on. Give it a try.

821
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,608
你不知道，事关重大
You don't understand what's at stake here.

822
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,361
乔叔叔已经看见了面包
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

823
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:21,364
我们已经到了危急关头 不能后退了
We're past the point of no return!

824
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:23,658
如果他得不到花生酱和果子冻
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

825
00:49:23,783 --> 00:49:25,493
我们代价惨重！
We all pay!

826
00:49:26,118 --> 00:49:27,161
我不知道
I don't know.

827
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:29,330
你一定要帮我们渡过这次危机 刘易斯
You would really be helping us out, Lewis.

828
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:30,623
拜托了
Please.

829

Did you just say, "Excellent," because I said, "Excellent"?

848
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:40,318

00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:05,176
你没听见我的话吗，笨蛋？ 去抓那小子带来给我
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot? Grab the boy and bring him!

857
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:09,513
呃，问题是 那边有那多人
Well, it's just that there's a million people over there,

858
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:11,807
而我只有两双小手
and I have little arms.

859
00:51:12,475 --> 00:51:15,770
我不太确定 这计划有没有经过深思熟虑
I'm just not so sure how well this plan was thought through.

860
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:20,566
主人？
Master?

861
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:23,611
<i>主人？</i>
<i>Master?</i>

862
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,198
好了，这应该可以了
Okay, that should do it.

863
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:30,117
太激动了，让她射吧，刘易斯
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

864
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:32,995
赶快，乔叔叔快支撑不住了
Quickly. Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

865
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:34,413
大家都准备好了？
Everybody ready?

866
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,290
- 开始吧，卡尔 - 对
- Go, Carl. - Yeah!

867
00:51:39,752 --> 00:51:40,878
它现在工作了吗？
Is it gonna work?

868
00:51:41,003 --> 00:51:42,254
哦，不！
Oh, no!

869
00:51:46,425 --> 00:51:47,760
不！
No!

870
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:51,305
我不知道 对不起，真的对不起
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

871
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,891
- 你失败了！ - 了不起！
- You failed! - And it was awesome!

872
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:56,268
- 真不可思议！ - 太优秀了！
- Exceptional! - Outstanding!

873
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:58,270
我见过更好的
I've seen better.

874
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:02,233
从失败中可以学到很多 从成功中，只能锦上添花
From failing, you learn. From success, not so much.

875
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:04,110
如果我每次失败就选择放弃
If I gave up every time I failed,

876
00:52:04,235 --> 00:52:06,153
我永远也造不出我的肉丸大炮
I never would have made the meatball cannon.

877
00:52:06,278 --> 00:52:08,739
我永远发明我不了我的防火裤
I never would have made my fireproof pants.

878
00:52:11,242 --> 00:52:12,493
很明显还有很多问题需要解决
Still working out the kinks.

879
00:52:12,618 --> 00:52:14,870
正如我丈夫常说的…
Like my husband always says...

880
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:23,963
<i>勇往直前… 勇往直前…</i>
<i>Keep moving Keep moving</i>

881
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:25,131
<i>停</i>
<i>Stop</i>

882
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:33,347
好吧，会说话的青蛙不是个好奴才
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

883
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:35,850
需要另外找个同党 块头大，不要太聪明
Need another henchman, something large, not too bright.

884
00:52:35,975 --> 00:52:37,685
不会跟我顶嘴的家伙
Something that won't talk back.

885
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,979
他还在这干嘛？ 把他干掉
What is he still doing here? Get rid of him.

886
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:41,564
噢，我的头
Oh, my noggin.

887
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:44,025
嘿，你干什么？ 把你的脏手拿开
Hey, what are you doing? Get your lousy mitts off of me!

888
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,152
你将会为你所做的一切后悔的
You're gonna regret this!

889
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:51,490
等等！等等！别动，就是它了
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

890
00:52:52,742 --> 00:52:55,119
我是不是该告诉多里斯呢
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

891
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,538
不，给它一个惊喜吧
No, I'll make it a surprise.

892
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,838
好了，大家静一静 静一静
All right, everyone, quiet down. Quiet down.

893
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:09,759
我提议为刘易斯和他的锦绣前程干杯
I propose a toast to Lewis and his brilliant failure.

894
00:53:09,884 --> 00:53:12,428
祝他在未来取得巨大的成功
May it lead to success in the future.

895
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:15,222
天哪，你们太好了
Gosh, you're all so nice.

896
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:18,142
如果我有个家庭，我…
If I had a family, I...

897
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:21,228
我希望他们就跟你们一样
I'd want them to be just like you.

898
00:53:21,604 --> 00:53:24,065
哦，那好，为刘易斯干杯！
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

899
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,775
为刘易斯干杯！
To Lewis!

900
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,901
为刘易斯干杯！
To Lewis!

901
00:53:27,026 --> 00:53:28,194
太好了
Yeah!

902
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:31,238
- 来吧，刘易斯！ - 表现出色，伙计
- Come on, Lewis! - Good show, buddy!

903
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:34,408
假如路易斯・阿姆斯壮说“我不能”
What if Louis Armstrong said, "I can't"?

904
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:35,743
你认为他还能登上月球吗？
You think he'd have walked on the moon?

905
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:38,204
亲爱的，路易斯・阿姆斯壮是位歌手
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

906
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:43,959
他说“如果他有个家庭的话” 是什么意思？
What did he mean, if he had a family?

907
00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:45,461
哦，刘易斯是个孤儿
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

908
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:46,921
孤儿？
Orphan?

909
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:02,144
- 哦， 不！ - 巨无霸！
- Oh, no! - Big boy!

910
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:04,772
起来，你这个脂粉气男人
Get up, you pansy!

911
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:06,190
多么绝妙的计划啊！
What a great plan!

912
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:10,611
回到过去偷一个恐龙回来 噢，多里斯会为我感到多么的自豪
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur. Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

913
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:13,906
你怎么没告诉我 你养了一条恐龙宠物？
Why didn't you tell me you had a pet dinosaur?

914
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:15,074
因为我们根本没养
Because we don't.

915
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:17,326
你在说什么呢？ 它就站在那里
What are you talking about? He's standing right here.

916
00:54:19,537 --> 00:54:22,248
哦，不！不，你不能吃掉他
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

917
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:24,000
<i>我要活的</i>
<i>I need him alive.</i>

918
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:27,461
火车去对付它！
Choo-chew on this!

919
00:54:31,173 --> 00:54:32,633
刘易斯！
Lewis!

920
00:54:38,514 --> 00:54:41,267
准备，瞄准，开火！
Ready, aim, fire!

921
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:51,444
接住你了
Got you!

922
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:56,115
你惹错家族了
You messed with the wrong family!

923
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:05,541
叮咚！披萨到了
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

924
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:11,631
不！
No!

925
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:16,719
好了，大伙，这恐龙成了披萨馅了
Okay, everybody, this dino's deep-dished.

926
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:20,723
快跑
Run!

927
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,477
哦，他把卡尔吃掉了！
Oh! He ate Carl!

928
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:29,065
- 帮帮我们！救命啊！ - 噢，天哪！
- Help us! Help! Help! - Oh, goodness!

929
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:42,328
噢，不！
Oh, no.

930
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:49,752
打进去
Incoming!

931
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:52,171
快跑
Run!

932
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:56,175
现在去抓那小子！
Now, go get that boy!

933
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:15,277
<i>怎么回事？</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

934
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:16,487
怎么不去抓住他？
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

935
00:56:16,612 --> 00:56:17,822
我的头太大…
I have a big head...

936
00:56:17,947 --> 00:56:19,657
手太小
...and little arms.

937
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:21,242
我不太确定
I'm just not sure...

938
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,202
这计划有没有经过深思熟虑
...how well this plan was thought through.

939
00:56:25,788 --> 00:56:27,164
主人？
Master?

940
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:30,501
蠢材，蠢材，蠢材！
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

941
00:56:34,588 --> 00:56:35,715
戴圆顶硬礼帽的家伙
Bowler Hat Guy!

942
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,216
你能够吃掉他
Him you can eat.

943
00:56:37,508 --> 00:56:39,719
- 刘易斯，快跑！ - 威尔伯！
- Lewis, run! - Wilbur!

944
00:56:57,945 --> 00:56:58,988
不！
No!

945
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:21,886
噢，不！
Oh, no!

946
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:26,265
小多里斯现在要与鱼同眠了
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

947
00:57:31,187 --> 00:57:33,606
- 接得好 - 肉丸射击漂亮！
- Nice catch. - Nice meatball shooting!

948
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:35,274
看来我们是最佳拍档，对吧？
Guess we made a pretty good team, huh?

949
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:37,068
是啊，我们确实是的
Yeah, guess we did.

950
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:39,904
- 孩子们，你们没事吧 ？ - 我们很好，妈妈
- Are you boys all right? - We're good, Mom.

951
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:41,781
你没看到我们怎么打败那恐龙吗？
Yeah, didn't you see us take out that dinosaur?

952
00:57:41,906 --> 00:57:44,241
哦，酷毙了，妈妈！
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

953
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:48,871
噢，我意思是，对不起，我没…
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

954
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:50,581
噢，刘易斯，不要紧
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

955
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:55,544
你没事我真的感到很高兴
I'm really happy you're safe.

956
00:57:55,836 --> 00:57:57,505
- 你的头 - 什么？
- Your head. - What?

957
00:57:58,506 --> 00:58:00,091
哦，只是擦伤，刘易斯
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

958
00:58:01,217 --> 00:58:04,887
你们都为我付出了那么多
You all sacrificed so much for me.

959
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:07,974
- 那是应该的 - 你是个很特别的孩子
- Well, of course. - You are a special kid.

960
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:09,308
独一无二的
One of a kind.

961
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:12,687
好了，在一些真正很糟糕的事情 发生之前，你该把他带走
Okay, you should get him out of here before something really bad happens.

962
00:58:12,812 --> 00:58:15,982
傻乎乎的笨机器人 一切都在我的掌握中
Silly, silly robot. I've got it all under control.

963
00:58:16,357 --> 00:58:18,651
好的，大伙们 今天大家都辛苦了
Okay, everybody, it's been a long, hard day

964
00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:20,653
整天都是感情风波 还有恐龙大战
filled with emotional turmoil and dinosaur fights,

965
00:58:20,778 --> 00:58:23,698
所以大伙都回去睡觉吧 我和刘易斯要走了
so why don't you all hit the hay, and Lewis and me will get going?

966
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:29,286
你必须得现在走吗？ 我的意思是，现在已经很晚了
Do you have to go now? I mean, you know, it's getting late.

967
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:32,873
也许刘易斯能在这住一晚
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

968
00:58:32,999 --> 00:58:34,875
妈妈，以后再找个时间吧，好吗？
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

969
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:38,963
好吧，任何时候你想过来 我们都欢迎
Well, any time you want to come over, you just come over.

970
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:42,133
- 妈妈 - 事实是我们喜欢有你在
- Mom. - The truth is, we love having you.

971
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:44,760
- 我们真的得走了 - 不
- We really have to go. - No.

972
00:58:45,553 --> 00:58:48,723
不，你不需要走，你得留下
No, you don't. You have to stay.

973
00:58:49,473 --> 00:58:53,019
我的意思是，还有哪个家庭 比我们的家庭更适合你呢？
I mean, who would be a better family for you than us?

974
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:55,396
你觉得呢，刘易斯？
What do you say, Lewis?

975
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:57,940
你想成为罗宾逊家庭的一成员吗？
Do you want to be a Robinson?

976
00:59:00,568 --> 00:59:03,571
你想收养我吗？
You want to adopt me?

977
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,041
是的！ 太好了！
- Yeah! - Yes!

978
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:26,510
好吧，事实上我是来自过去
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

979
00:59:26,636 --> 00:59:27,803
现在你们都知道这个大秘密了
Now you know the big secret.

980
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:32,058
威尔伯，你都干了些什么？ 你怎么能把他带到这里来？
Wilbur, what have you done? How could you bring him here?

981
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:34,060
这个问题问得好
That is an excellent question.

982
00:59:34,185 --> 00:59:35,686
请不要对威尔伯生气
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

983
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:37,188
他只是想帮我
He was just being a good friend.

984
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:41,442
刘易斯，很对不起 但你必须得走
Lewis, I am so sorry, but you have to go.

985
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:42,985
什么？你刚才还说…
What? You just said...

986
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,987
我知道我刚才说了什么
I know what I said.

987
00:59:45,112 --> 00:59:47,073
我来自过去，又怎么样？
I'm from the past. So what?

988
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:50,743
刘易斯，看着我，你是个…
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

989
00:59:51,452 --> 00:59:52,995
你是个好孩子
You're a great kid,

990
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,040
我们决不愿意做任何事情去伤害你
and we would never do anything to hurt you,

991
00:59:57,375 --> 01:00:01,003
但对不起 你必须得回到属于你的时间
but I'm sorry. You have to go back to your own time.

992
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:07,259
对了，关于这点 其中一台时间机器坏了
Yeah, about that, one of the time machines is broken,

993
01:00:07,468 --> 01:00:10,930
另外一台被戴圆顶硬礼帽的家伙给偷了
and the other one was stolen by a guy with a bowler hat,

994
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:14,016
这可以解释这恐龙为什么会出现
which kind of explains the dino.

995
01:00:19,355 --> 01:00:20,606
我去打电话给你爸爸
I'm calling your father.

996
01:00:20,731 --> 01:00:22,274
慢着，如果我不得不离开
Wait. If I have to leave,

997
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,610
至少我能回到过去找我的妈妈吧？
can I at least go back and find my mom?

998
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,445
威尔伯答应过我的
Wilbur promised.

999
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,780
你答应他什么啦？
You promised what?

1000
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:29,740
我永远都不会兑现的 我发誓
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

1001
01:00:30,408 --> 01:00:32,785
- 你对我撒谎？ - 没有
- You lied to me? - No!

1002
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,162
是的
Yes.

1003
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:36,831
刘易斯！刘易斯，等等
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1004
01:00:36,956 --> 01:00:40,459
我不敢相信我真是傻得可以 居然真的相信你是我的朋友
I can't believe I was dumb enough to actually believe you were my friend!

1005
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:42,461
我是你朋友！
I am your friend!

1006
01:00:42,586 --> 01:00:46,132
先生，你永远都不允许外出 永不翻案
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1007
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:10,990
<i>噢，是啊，多里斯，真是可惜了</i>
<i>Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.</i>

1008
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:16,203
<i>他一心想做的只是回到过去 和自己从没见过的母亲会面</i>
<i>All he wants to do is go back in time to meet the mother he never knew,</i>

1009
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:21,667
<i>但他们却不让他去 不过我们却乐意</i>
<i>but they won't let him. We'd let him, though.</i>

1010
01:01:22,668 --> 01:01:25,630
<i>只可惜我们没有时光机器</i>
<i>Too bad we don't have a time machine.</i>

1011
01:01:25,755 --> 01:01:29,216
<i>噢，慢着，我们有一台</i>
<i>Oh, wait. We do.</i>

1012
01:01:29,592 --> 01:01:31,135
戴圆顶硬礼帽的家伙？
Bowler Hat Guy?

1013
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,305
- 你好，刘易斯 - 你想干什么？
- Hello, Lewis. - What do you want?

1014
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,099
来让你梦想成真
To make your dream come true.

1015
01:01:37,224 --> 01:01:40,353
你所要做的就是把 这笨重的玩艺重新装好
All you have to do is put Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1016
01:01:40,478 --> 01:01:42,980
我们就带你回去找你妈妈
and we'll take you back to find your mommy.

1017
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:44,940
刘易斯！
Lewis!

1018
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,319
让我们好好谈谈吧，刘易斯 出来吧！
Let's just talk about this, Lewis. Come on!

1019
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:50,154
我知道你就在附近某处
I know you're around here somewhere.

1020
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:53,991
刘易斯！
Lewis!

1021
01:02:15,262 --> 01:02:18,641
我想不通你为什么会对 这件垃圾感兴趣
I can't imagine why you're so interested in this piece of junk.

1022
01:02:18,641 --> 01:02:21,060
那是我自己知道的事 你自己去了解发现
That's for me to know and you to find out.

1023
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:23,270
现在告诉我怎么操作这玩艺
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1024
01:02:23,396 --> 01:02:25,106
它运转不了，从来就没有工作过
It doesn't work. Never did.

1025
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:26,273
那么假设它能运转
Well, supposing it did,

1026
01:02:26,399 --> 01:02:28,234
如果有人把这个发明展示给，例如
and if one were presenting the invention to, say,

1027
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:31,404
一家很大的发明公司的董事会
a board of directors for a very large invention company,

1028
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:33,197
他在哪可以找到那“启动”的开关？
where might one find the "On" switch?

1029
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:35,366
当然，这只是一个假设
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1030
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:37,660
好吧，首先，你旋转这个旋钮两次
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1031
01:02:37,785 --> 01:02:39,412
然后按这个红色的按钮
then push this red button,

1032
01:02:39,537 --> 01:02:40,871
这就行了，很简单吧
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1033
01:02:40,997 --> 01:02:42,331
这方式启动机器真是蠢得可以！
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1034
01:02:42,456 --> 01:02:44,500
好吧，现在带我去见我的妈妈吧
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1035
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,002
好的，当然了
Yes, of course.

1036
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:47,336
多里斯？
Doris?

1037
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:51,215
我们谈好条件的！
We had a deal!

1038
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,217
我的手指交叉的 所以不算数
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1039
01:02:53,342 --> 01:02:55,886
你为什么这样对我？ 我没有做过任何对不起你的事啊
Why are you doing this to me? I never did anything to you.

1040
01:02:56,012 --> 01:02:57,972
你还没有弄明白吗？
You still haven't figured it out?

1041
01:02:58,097 --> 01:02:59,432
弄明白什么？
Figured out what?

1042
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:01,559
那么看看这能不能让你记起什么
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1043
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:04,061
未来之父 卓越的发明家
Father of the Future, inventor extraordinaire,

1044
01:03:04,186 --> 01:03:05,688
“勇往直前”？
"Keep moving forward"?

1045
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:08,274
那不是我 那是威尔伯的爸爸
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1046
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,613
你是在说
Are you saying

1047
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:17,158
我就是威尔伯的爸爸？
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1048
01:03:18,117 --> 01:03:19,910
答对了 该给你一份奖品
Give the boy a prize.

1049
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:23,998
你长大成为这悲惨时代的奠基人
You grew up to be the founder of this wretched time,

1050
01:03:24,123 --> 01:03:25,750
所以我计划去破坏你的定数
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1051
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,919
- 很容易的 - 那么…
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy. - Well...

1052
01:03:29,462 --> 01:03:31,255
如果我是威尔伯的爸爸…
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1053
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,423
继续想下去
Keep going.

1054
01:03:32,965 --> 01:03:34,759
如果我是威尔伯的爸爸…
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1055
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:36,552
是的，谢谢 ，我们已经知道这点了
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1056
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:39,347
但那跟你有什么关系？
But what does that have to do with you?

1057
01:03:40,431 --> 01:03:43,351
请允许我开灯照亮这个物体
Allow me to shed some light on the subject.

1058
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:47,688
我的老睡房！
My old room!

1059
01:03:47,813 --> 01:03:50,191
你想你是指我们的老睡房吧
I think you mean our old room.

1060
01:03:50,316 --> 01:03:53,361
- 什么？ - 是的！是我
- What? - Yes! Yes, it is I,

1061
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:54,779
迈克・雅顾博伊恩！
Mike Yagoobian!

1062
01:03:55,488 --> 01:03:59,116
我知道，我很恶心，但你要学着去喜欢
I know. I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1063
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:00,660
你怎么会变成这样的？
How did you end up like this?

1064
01:04:00,785 --> 01:04:05,581
说来话长且令人同情 那是关于一个满怀希望男孩的故事
Well, it's a long and pitiful story about a young boy with a dream,

1065
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:08,334
梦想赢得一个小小的联赛冠军
a dream of winning a Little League championship,

1066
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:15,216
<i>但这个梦想在最后一轮破灭了</i>
<i>a dream that was ruined in the last inning.</i>

1067
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:18,511
<i>因为我的过错 我们输掉了比赛，就因为最后一轮</i>
<i>We lost by one run because of me.</i>

1068
01:04:18,636 --> 01:04:19,720
揍扁他！
Get him!

1069
01:04:19,845 --> 01:04:23,891
如果我没有睡着 我就能接住那球
If I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have caught the ball!

1070
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:26,060
我们就会赢
And we would have won!

1071
01:04:26,185 --> 01:04:27,728
你们明白吗？
Do you understand?

1072
01:04:27,853 --> 01:04:30,481
<i>因为某些原因 没有人愿意领养我</i>
<i>For some reason, no one wanted to adopt me.</i>

1073
01:04:30,606 --> 01:04:33,734
<i>神童科尼利厄斯・罗宾逊14岁便大学毕业 </i>
<i>Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson graduates from college at age 14.</i>

1074
01:04:33,859 --> 01:04:37,571
<i>本年度诺贝尔奖的获得者 是年轻的科尼利厄斯・罗宾逊 </i>
<i>This year's Nobel Prize goes to a young Cornelius Robinson.</i>

1075
01:04:37,697 --> 01:04:39,281
嘿，顾博，你好吗？好漂亮的文件夹
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1076
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,367
嘿，顾博，今天到我家玩吗？
Hey, Goob, wanna come over to my house today?

1077
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:43,411
<i>他们都恨我</i>
<i>They all hated me.</i>

1078
01:04:43,703 --> 01:04:47,081
<i>后来，他们关闭了孤儿院 所有人都走了</i>
<i>Eventually, they closed down the orphanage and everyone left,</i>

1079
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:48,833
<i>除了我</i>
<i>except me.</i>

1080
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,876
<i>科尼利厄斯・罗宾逊重建了发明谷公司</i>
<i>Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.</i>

1081
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:52,211
<i>- 罗宾逊涉足… - 新名字…</i>
<i>- Robinson reaches out to... - It's new name,</i>

1082
01:04:52,336 --> 01:04:54,338
<i>- 罗宾逊工业公司 - 科尼利厄斯・罗宾逊</i>
<i>- Robinson Industries. - Cornelius Robinson!</i>

1083
01:04:54,463 --> 01:04:57,550
<i>- 科尼利厄斯・罗宾逊现在… - 又一件令人惊奇的…</i>
<i>- Cornelius Robinson is now... - Now here's another amazing...</i>

1084
01:04:57,675 --> 01:05:02,847
<i>就在那时候 我知道那不是我的错</i>
<i>It was then that I realised it wasn't my fault.</i>

1085
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:04,348
<i>而是你的错</i>
<i>It was yours.</i>

1086
01:05:04,473 --> 01:05:07,685
<i>如果你没有让我熬一整夜 帮你做那蠢发明</i>
<i>If you hadn't kept me up all night working on your stupid project,</i>

1087
01:05:08,227 --> 01:05:09,854
<i>那么我就不会接不住那球</i>
<i>then I wouldn't have missed the catch,</i>

1088
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:14,025
<i>于是我想出了一个辉煌的复仇大计</i>
<i>so I devised a brilliant plan to get my revenge.</i>

1089
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:19,530
罗宾逊，你坏透了！
Robinson, you stink!

1090
01:05:20,031 --> 01:05:24,201
<i>就在我准备要破坏 罗宾逊工业公司的时候</i>
<i>Then, just as I was on the brink of destroying Robinson Industries,</i>

1091
01:05:24,744 --> 01:05:27,079
<i>我遇见了她</i>
<i>I met her.</i>

1092
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:32,418
<i>我们撤回到我们那邪恶的巢穴</i>
<i>We retreated to our villainous lair,</i>

1093
01:05:32,543 --> 01:05:35,671
<i>在那里多里斯全告诉了我 她被欺骗和无比痛苦的故事</i>
<i>where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe.</i>

1094
01:05:35,796 --> 01:05:39,216
<i>很明显，你发明她的初衷是 想让她成为“帮助帽”</i>
<i>Apparently, you invented her to be a Helping Hat,</i>

1095
01:05:39,342 --> 01:05:41,552
<i>听命于人类</i>
<i>a slave to humankind,</i>

1096
01:05:45,514 --> 01:05:48,726
<i>但多里斯知道她的能力 远远超出这范围</i>
<i>but Doris knew she was capable of so much more.</i>

1097
01:05:54,023 --> 01:05:56,817
<i>但是你没有看到她的真正潜力</i>
<i>However, you didn't see her true potential.</i>

1098
01:05:56,942 --> 01:05:58,944
<i>- 受够了 - 于是你关闭了她</i>
<i>- Got it. - So you shut her down,</i>

1099
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:07,578
<i>大概你以为你关闭了她</i>
<i>or so you thought.</i>

1100
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:19,423
<i>我们俩都想找你算账</i>
<i>We both had a score to settle with you,</i>

1101
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:25,221
<i>虽然我的复仇计划如此精妙，多里斯…</i>
<i>and while my plan for revenge was brilliant, Doris' was...</i>

1102
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:27,181
<i>好吧，我们还是选多里斯的计划</i>
<i>Well, we went with Doris',</i>

1103
01:06:27,306 --> 01:06:31,894
<i>但是我做出了非常非常重要的贡献</i>
<i>but I made a very, very important contribution.</i>

1104
01:06:31,894 --> 01:06:34,480
<i>我们俩一起是最佳拍档</i>
<i>Together we made the perfect team.</i>

1105
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:45,658
威尔伯！
Wilbur!

1106
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:48,452
确定你把那门关严实了 否则警报就不起作用了
Make sure you shut that door tight, or else the alarm won't engage.

1107
01:06:48,577 --> 01:06:49,704
好的，妈妈
Yeah, Mom.

1108
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:55,793
<i>我去到你家，偷偷地溜进车库</i>
<i>I went to your house, snuck in the garage</i>

1109
01:06:55,918 --> 01:06:57,670
<i>偷走了时光机器</i>
<i>and stole the time machine,</i>

1110
01:07:00,673 --> 01:07:05,636
<i>这全靠那个额头前有尖尖头发的小孩 忘记了关那车库门</i>
<i>all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid who forgot to lock the garage door.</i>

1111
01:07:09,974 --> 01:07:13,019
现在所需要做的就是回到发明谷
And now all that's left is to return to Inventco,

1112
01:07:13,144 --> 01:07:15,896
在那里我把你的小发明冒认是我的
where I'll pass off your little gizmo as my own.

1113
01:07:16,022 --> 01:07:18,399
但你不知道 那会给这未来造成什么样的影响！
But you have no idea what that could do to this future!

1114
01:07:18,524 --> 01:07:21,652
那我可不管 我只想毁掉你的生活
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1115
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:23,404
顾博，我不明白
Goob, I had no idea.

1116
01:07:23,529 --> 01:07:25,406
闭嘴，不要叫我顾博
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1117
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:28,200
你知道有多少坏人 可以叫顾博这样的名字？
How many evil villains do you know who can pull off a name like Goob?

1118
01:07:28,784 --> 01:07:30,703
我很抱歉你的生活变得这么差
Look, I'm sorry your life turned out so bad,

1119
01:07:30,828 --> 01:07:32,913
但不要责怪我 是你自己弄得一团糟的
but don't blame me. You messed it up yourself.

1120
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,751
你只是把注意力集中在坏的事情上面 你所需要做的就是…
You just focused on the bad stuff when all you had to do was

1121
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:40,630
让过去的一切随风消失 勇往直前
let go of the past and keep moving forward.

1122
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:41,797
让我们比较一下
Let's see.

1123
01:07:41,922 --> 01:07:44,800
对我自己生活负责还是责怪你
Take responsibility for my own life or blame you.

1124
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:48,721
“责怪你”轻易胜出
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1125
01:07:52,224 --> 01:07:55,478
这将是我生命中最精彩的一天
This is gonna be the best day of my life!

1126
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:06,864
多里斯，您能做做好事 帮我打开舱门吗？拜托
Doris, would you be a dear and open the hatch for me, please?

1127
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:15,164
不！
No!

1128
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:20,836
我不想破坏你邪恶的计划 然后跑掉，但是再见！
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan and run, but ta-ta!

1129
01:08:23,172 --> 01:08:24,674
但…
But...

1130
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,801
我想你一定很高兴见到我
I bet you're glad to see me.

1131
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:30,012
这是惩罚你没有关好车库门
That's for not locking the garage door.

1132
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:32,682
你都知道那？
You know about that?

1133
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:34,183
我什么都知道
I know everything.

1134
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:35,309
你得承认
You gotta admit,

1135
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:37,561
这会是一个很好的故事 哪一天你可以跟我讲起
this will be a great story to tell me someday.

1136
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:43,025
你们快看，孩子们 我们就要成功到家了
Look at that, boys. We're almost home free.

1137
01:08:52,076 --> 01:08:53,536
噢，不！
Oh, no!

1138
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:57,039
好好看一下吧，孩子们
Take a good look around, boys,

1139
01:08:57,164 --> 01:08:59,875
因为你们的未来就要改变了
because your future is about to change.

1140
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:04,046
刘易斯，你得把时光机器修好
Lewis, you have to fix the time machine.

1141
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:06,257
不，不，我不能
No. No, I can't.

1142
01:09:12,847 --> 01:09:15,057
你爸爸怎样？ 你可以去找他
What about your dad? You could call him.

1143
01:09:15,308 --> 01:09:17,685
- 你就是我爸爸 - 但那是在未来的事情
- You are my dad. - But that's in the future.

1144
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:20,521
未来将要不存在了 除非你修好时光机器
There won't be a future unless you fix the time machine.

1145
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,693
<i>是我把事情弄得乱七八糟的</i>
<i>Look, I messed up.</i>

1146
01:09:25,943 --> 01:09:28,904
我没有关好车库门 我拼命地努力试图弥补一切
I left the garage unlocked, and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1147
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,072
但现在都看你的了
but now it's up to you.

1148
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:33,576
你能做到的，爸爸
You can do it, Dad.

1149
01:09:34,952 --> 01:09:40,082
- 刘易斯？刘易斯！ - 威尔伯？威尔伯！
- Lewis? Lewis! - Wilbur? Wilbur!

1150
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:45,296
威尔伯
Wilbur.

1151
01:09:45,546 --> 01:09:48,633
罗宾逊夫人？阿特叔叔？勒富q？
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1152
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:05,399
<i>准备好大开眼界吧</i>
<i>Prepare to be amazed.</i>

1153
01:10:05,524 --> 01:10:08,235
<i>我叫它记忆扫描仪</i>
<i>I call it the Memory Scanner.</i>

1154
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,822
<i>那么，雅顾博伊恩 还有什么其他想法要和大家分享吗？</i>
<i>So, Yagoobian, any other ideas you'd like to share with us?</i>

1155
01:10:11,947 --> 01:10:15,326
<i>是的，我叫它们帽子助手</i>
<i>Yes. I call them Helping Hats.</i>

1156
01:10:18,537 --> 01:10:19,956
<i>它们无处不在</i>
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1157
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:24,877
<i>多里斯，发生什么事情？ 我搞不懂</i>
<i>Doris, what's happening? I don't understand.</i>

1158
01:10:25,002 --> 01:10:27,797
<i>我只是想毁掉他的未来 我并不想事情变成这样啊</i>
<i>I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.</i>

1159
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:31,050
<i>不！</i>
<i>No!</i>

1160
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:40,309
不 不，这一切不可能会发生的！不！
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1161
01:10:40,685 --> 01:10:43,813
噢，刘易斯，这已经发生了
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1162
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:46,477
我为什么会发明那荒谬的帽子？
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1163
01:12:57,154 --> 01:13:02,159
看仔细了，多里斯 因为你的未来就要改变了
Take a good look around, Doris, 'cause your future's about to change.

1164
01:13:10,626 --> 01:13:12,128
顾博，停下！
Goob, stop!

1165
01:13:12,837 --> 01:13:13,921
你不知道自己在干什么
You don't know what you're doing!

1166
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:16,132
我知道 我在毁掉你的未来
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1167
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:17,383
她在利用你，顾博
She's using you, Goob,

1168
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:19,677
当她得到了她想要的东西 她就会把你干掉
and when she gets what she wants, she'll get rid of you.

1169
01:13:19,802 --> 01:13:21,595
什么？什么？
What? What?

1170
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:29,395
我将永远都不会发明你
I am never going to invent you.

1171
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:38,154
来吧，顾博 我带你去看一些东西
Come on, Goob. I've got to show you something.

1172
01:13:47,413 --> 01:13:48,581
多里斯？
Doris?

1173
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,750
我以为她是我的朋友
I thought she was my friend.

1174
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:24,867
你做到了，刘易斯 你成功了！
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1175
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:29,163
我拖住他 你快去搬救兵
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1176
01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:30,331
放开他
Let him go.

1177
01:14:30,706 --> 01:14:33,209
你是怎么啦？ 他是个坏蛋
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1178
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:36,003
不，他不是 他是我的室友
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1179
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,922
- 什么？ - 他是我的老室友
- What? - He's my old roommate,

1180
01:14:38,047 --> 01:14:39,590
我真的觉得你们应该收养他
and I really think you guys should adopt him.

1181
01:14:39,715 --> 01:14:41,926
- 你疯了吗？ - 为什么不？给我一个好的理由
- Are you nuts? - Give me one good reason why not.

1182
01:14:42,051 --> 01:14:43,469
我给你三个好理由
I'll give you three good reasons.

1183
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:46,013
他偷了我们的时光机器 企图毁掉你的未来
He stole our time machine, tried to ruin your future,

1184
01:14:46,138 --> 01:14:48,474
还有他闻起来好像有30年没洗澡了
and he smells like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1185
01:14:48,808 --> 01:14:52,061
请允许我提醒你一下 我是你爸爸，你得听我的
May I remind you, I'm your father, and you have to do what I say.

1186
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:57,525
好吧，雅顾博伊恩先生，你想成为…
Okay, Mr Yagoobian, do you want to be a...

1187
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,735
- 他去哪了？ - 顾博？
- Where'd he go? - Goob?

1188
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:01,946
顾博！
Goob!

1189
01:15:03,906 --> 01:15:05,157
顾博
Goob.

1190
01:15:32,685 --> 01:15:33,728
你受伤了吗？ 有没有骨折？
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1191
01:15:33,853 --> 01:15:35,438
- 没有，我… - 你量了体温没有？
- No, I'm... - Do you have a temperature?

1192
01:15:35,563 --> 01:15:37,023
- 脑衰竭？ - 坏血病？
- Brain fag? - Scurvy?

1193
01:15:37,148 --> 01:15:38,232
- 绦虫病？ - 脂肪团？
- Tapeworm? - Cellulite?

1194
01:15:38,357 --> 01:15:40,985
不，不，我很好，我感觉很好
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1195
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,864
实际上 很久没感觉这么好了
In fact, better than I've felt in a long time.

1196
01:15:44,989 --> 01:15:48,242
弗兰妮，它们不见了 噢，这糟透了
Franny, they're gone. Oh, this is terrible!

1197
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:50,119
- 噢，天哪 - 他提早到家了
- Oh, boy. - Well, he's home early.

1198
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:53,748
弗兰妮，你在哪？ 时光机器都不见了
Franny, where are you? The time machines are gone!

1199
01:16:07,386 --> 01:16:09,138
被老女人出卖了
Ratted out by the old lady.

1200
01:16:10,222 --> 01:16:11,432
残酷啊
Harsh.

1201
01:16:16,145 --> 01:16:17,355
好了
Okay.

1202
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:31,035
是啊，每天都在办公室里不懈的工作
Yeah, beats working in an office every day.

1203
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,995
对，那是一定的了
Yeah, no kidding.

1204
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:35,539
嘿，想看看我最引以为豪的那个吗？
Hey! Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1205
01:16:35,665 --> 01:16:37,041
好啊
Yeah.

1206
01:16:39,835 --> 01:16:42,088
不，不，不，不 是那个
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1207
01:16:55,851 --> 01:16:58,145
这是我们的第一个真正的发明
It was our first real invention.

1208
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:00,564
这所有的一切都是由那开始的
It's the one that started it all.

1209
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:01,816
哇靠
Wowie.

1210
01:17:02,817 --> 01:17:06,529
那么如果我现在回去 这将是我的未来
So if I go back now, then this will be my future.

1211
01:17:06,654 --> 01:17:09,281
那就取决于你了
Well, that depends on you.

1212
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:10,408
没有什么事情是一成不变的
Nothing is set in stone.

1213
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:14,328
你需要做出正确的决定 然后保持奋勇前进
You gotta make the right choices and keep moving forward.

1214
01:17:18,332 --> 01:17:21,669
既然这次看上去一切都好 是不是意味着我…
Since it's gonna work this time, that means I...

1215
01:17:21,794 --> 01:17:26,048
我们最后将不会去看 妈妈是什么样子的？
We won't finally get to see what Mom looks like?

1216
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:29,844
我们有没有见到她？
Do we ever meet her?

1217
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,974
我想你得回到科学展
I think you're just gonna have to get back

1218
01:17:35,099 --> 01:17:37,852
自己去找答案
to that science fair and find out for yourself.

1219
01:17:37,977 --> 01:17:40,187
我就知道你会这么说
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

1220
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:44,358
那是因为我们俩是一个聪明的小孩
That's because we are one smart kid.

1221
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:50,364
- 再见 - 再见，刘易斯！
- So long! - Bye-bye, Lewis!

1222
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:52,992
- 再见，未来的姐夫 - 保重！再见，刘易斯！
- Farewell, future brother-in-law. - So long! See you later, Lewis!

1223
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:54,910
噢，别忘了马铃薯泥
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1224
01:17:56,287 --> 01:17:58,331
- 一路平安，小刘易斯 - 我会的
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis. - I will.

1225
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:00,207
嘿，既然你在这
Hey, while I got you here,

1226
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:03,753
有一些关于我设计方面的 小小的建议
just a couple of little suggestions regarding my design.

1227
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:08,424
实话实说吧，这手臂太细了 拎起茶壶都困难
Let's face it, these skinny limbs don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1228
01:18:08,549 --> 01:18:11,552
其实最重要的一点 嘿，千万别忘了发明我
All that really matters is, hey, don't forget to invent me.

1229
01:18:11,677 --> 01:18:14,096
- 你在开玩笑吧？那怎么可能忘了！ - 我爱你
- Are you kidding? No way! - I love you.

1230
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:17,725
有太多的事情 我希望能够问你
There's so many things I wish I could ask you.

1231
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:20,478
对不起，现在要时光旅行了 问题留待以后再问吧
Excuse me. Time travel now, questions later.

1232
01:18:20,603 --> 01:18:21,604
- 但我… - 别担心
- But I... - Don't worry.

1233
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:24,565
你只要回到那科学展 我们很快又再见面了
Just get back to that science fair, and we'll see you real soon.

1234
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:28,069
噢，对，好的，我会的，再见
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1235
01:18:28,194 --> 01:18:30,738
- 再见，孩子 - 再次感谢你所做的一切
- Goodbye, son. - Thanks again for everything!

1236
01:18:30,863 --> 01:18:33,366
- 等等，刘易斯，还有一件事 - 什么？
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing. - Yeah?

1237
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:38,371
给将来的一点小提示 我永远是对的
Just a little tip for the future. I am always right.

1238
01:18:38,496 --> 01:18:41,415
即便是我错了，我还是对的
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1239
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:46,712
她是对的，如果我是你 我就会照她的话去做
She's right. I'd just go with it if I were you.

1240
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,923
我的确如此
And I am.

1241
01:18:49,715 --> 01:18:51,467
那么你是绝对正确的
Then you're absolutely right.

1242
01:18:54,053 --> 01:18:55,888
好吧，我来了
All right, I'm coming.

1243
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:58,307
又不是你将永远都见不到他们
Well, it's not like you're never gonna see them again.

1244
01:18:58,432 --> 01:19:00,226
他们毕竟都是你的家人
They are your family, after all.

1245
01:19:30,089 --> 01:19:31,090
等一等
Wait a minute.

1246
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:33,301
你应该带我回到那科学展
You're supposed to take me back to the science fair.

1247
01:19:33,426 --> 01:19:34,593
我知道
I know.

1248
01:19:40,182 --> 01:19:42,935
那么我想你按错了号码
Well, I think you punched in the wrong numbers.

1249
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:45,688
我们说好了 如果你修好了时光机器
We agreed that, if you fixed the time machine,

1250
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:47,690
我会带你去见你的妈妈
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1251
01:19:47,815 --> 01:19:48,983
什么？
What?

1252
01:20:07,543 --> 01:20:08,961
说话算数
A deal's a deal.

1253
01:22:12,335 --> 01:22:15,212
我搞不懂 你为什么就这么让她走？
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1254
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:19,133
因为我已经有了一个家庭
Because I already have a family.

1255
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:31,937
我从来没想到我爸爸 会是我最好的朋友
I never thought my dad would be my best friend.

1256
01:22:32,938 --> 01:22:35,107
现在好了，别又让我来搭救你
Now, now, don't make me come and bail you out again.

1257
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:37,943
我不会的
I won't.

1258
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:40,029
记住，我有时光机器
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1259
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:41,656
如果你又把事情弄糟了 我就会一直回来
If you mess up again, I'll just keep coming back

1260
01:22:41,781 --> 01:22:42,949
一直到你做对为止
till you get it right.

1261
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:46,827
- 你记住那句座右铭了？ - 记住了
- You got that motto? - I got it.

1262
01:22:46,953 --> 01:22:48,204
别忘了
Don't forget it.

1263
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:50,122
那是不可能的
I don't think that's possible.

1264
01:22:51,582 --> 01:22:52,792
你该走了
You better get going.

1265
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:55,127
再见，威尔伯
See you later, Wilbur.

1266
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:15,064
等一等！
Wait a minute!

1267
01:23:23,656 --> 01:23:25,658
顾博！顾博，醒一醒！
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1268
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:26,826
什么？
What?

1269
01:23:29,745 --> 01:23:31,122
太棒了
That's it!

1270
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:42,008
威勒斯坦先生 我知道出错的原因了
Mr Willerstein, I know what went wrong.

1271
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:44,343
可以再给我一次机会吗？ 拜托
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1272
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:49,265
来接我的人还没有到 所以快动手吧
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1273
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,560
我需要一个志愿者
I need a volunteer.

1274
01:23:55,896 --> 01:23:57,523
现在告诉我一个输入日期
Now, just give me a date to input.

1275
01:23:57,648 --> 01:23:59,066
哦，让我想想
Well, now, let's see.

1276
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:02,320
我的第一次科学展 我得到我的第一台显微镜的那天
There's my first science fair, the day I got my first microscope,
