果真如此的话 绑在这儿的应该是你，而不是你儿子
If that's true, then you shouId be taking the rap here, not your son.

173
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,549
如果事出于我，你们要如何处置？
And what happens to me if it's my fauIt?

174

一小时的"养育子女"课程

-You didn't bring my pants. -Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

要是你需要裤子，我这儿有条备用的
If you need pants, I carry an extra pair.

187
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:17,050
因为男孩子总是淘气嘛
You know how boys are, aIways praying through the knees.

188
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,507
为什么要帮我？我和你无亲无故
Why are you heIping me? I'm not your kid.

我们是邻居啊，要是我家孩子碰上这事 你爸一定也会伸手相助的
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father wouId do the same for my boys.

当然咯
Of course I do.

Hey, hey! It's your oId paI Krusty, for my new pork sandwich, the KIogger.

If you can find a greasier sandwich, you're in Mexico!

198
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,089
好啦
And we're cIear.

199
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,182
太好了！伙计，把这头猪宰了吧
Perfect. Cut, print, kiII the pig.

200
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:07,348
什么？！ 你…它衣冠楚楚，你怎么忍心下手？
What--?! You can't kiII him if he's wearing peopIe cIothes!

201
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:23,409
我会带你回家的
You're coming home with me.

202
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,998
一千只眼睛？什么意思？
''A thousand eyes. '' What couId that be?

203
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,998
嗯…我很确定…一千…是个数字

Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married to someone who's reckIessIy impuIsive?

说实话，我一直为这事懊悔不已呢
ActuaIIy, it's aged me horribIy.

快和我们的新成员打个招呼吧！

Oh, you're gonna Iove him. Look, he does an impression of you.

你吓着她了
You naiIed her.

212
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:14,463
它还会取笑我呢
He aIso does me.

213
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:17,671
你笑了，那现在就没事啦
You smiIed. I'm off the hook.

214
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:29,762

你爸爸有带你去钓过鱼吗？
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

223
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:17,356
爸！拿灭虫器来逮鱼可不太厚道！
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper to catch the fish.

224
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,068
如果你和我一样对这些鱼充满关爱之情 就会希望它们带着尊严，庄重的赴黄泉
If you Iove fish Iike I do, you want them to die with dignity.

225
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,330

I think I have a nibbIe.

226
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,586
和你一起钓鱼应该更有趣吧？
I think fishing might be more fun with you.

227
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,586
太好了，我帮你冲杯可可吧？
Oh, great. Now, how about I fix you some cocoa?

少来啦，可可是女孩子喝的
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

Oh, wait. I didn't teII you the best part. He Ioves the environment.

亲爱的，这太好了
Oh, honey, that's great.

00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:30,254
不过最重要的是，他愿意聆听你的心声
But the very best thing is that he Iistens to you.

237
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:33,760
因为对男人来说，这点是最…
Because nothing means more than for a man to--

它能游走于蜘蛛网吗？
Can he swing from a web?

00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,528
当然不行，它归根结底还是猪呀
No, he can 't, he's a pig

Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the Iake.

282
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,436
好吧，那我就把后院清理的垃圾扔到车里去
Fine. I wiII put my yard trimmings in a car compactor.

283
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,766
警长，我觉得那好像是具尸体
Chief, I think there was a dead body in there.

284
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:32,235
我也是这么想的，泰利说了是后院废物
I thought that too, untiI he said ''yard trimmings. ''

285
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:34,154
卢，你得会听才行
You gotta Iearn to Iisten, Lou.

286
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:38,694
现在来看看这屏障是不是 对傻子也百毒不侵
Let us now make sure this barrier is compIeteIy idiot-proof.

287

千万别瞎想
Don't get any ideas.

293
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:19,738
也许我们应该亲一下 以缓解我们之间的紧张关系
Maybe we shouId kiss, just to break the tension.

294
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,861
这儿是怎么了？
What's going on here?

295
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,158
没什么，没什么
Nothing. Nothing.

296

我觉得猪不应该进屋的
I'm not sure that pig shouId be in the house.

297
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,914
另外，你打算怎么处理…它的排泄物？
And by the way, what are you doing with his Ieavings?

这玩意儿漏了
It's Ieaking.

301

不是漏，是溢出来了
It's not Ieaking, it's overfIowing.

才两天它就拉了这一大罐子？！

I can't escape the feeIing that this is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

311
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,076
（危险性废物处理中心）

312
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:31,684
喂

荷马，快过来

Oh, my God, oh, my God! I just got one thing I gotta do first.

邪恶！

哦，对啊
Oh, right.

323

往那儿看，那是与斯普林菲尔德接壤的四大州
Look at that. You can see the four states that border SpringfieId:

324
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:09,948

…不过上帝无所不能啊
. . .but who am I to question the work of the AImighty?

感谢万能的上帝创造出这么 非凡、精致而又智能的生物

戳！戳！戳！
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:37,512
嘿！要是再戳它眼睛，就是触犯法律！
Hey! Jab one more eye and it's a federaI crime.

333

- 你们是谁？ - 环保局（EPA）

斯普林菲尔德的污染已经到了危急状态
PoIIution in SpringfieId has reached crisis IeveIs.

338
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:11,263
我真讨厌这差事 不是危机，就是什么世界末日
I hate this job. Everything's ''crisis'' this and ''end of the worId'' that.

339
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:14,308
就没人先说个笑话引出议题 我想念丹尼・狄・维托
Nobody opens with a joke. I miss Danny De Vito.

340
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:18,183
你想听笑话？ 要是你听过这个的话，就阻止我讲下去
You want a joke, huh? Stop me if you've heard this one.

341
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:22,398
看看这些愤怒的眼睛和巨型獠牙

就跟在肯尼迪家过圣诞节一样恐怖

总统先生，您委任我为环保局长时…
You know, sir, when you made me head of the EPA. . .

344

345
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,818
低就于千年不遇的无能部门

346

可我为什么还是欣然接受呢？
And why did I take the job?

347
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,869
因为我是个富翁，希望回馈社会
Because I'm a rich man who wanted to give something back.

348
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:40,626
我不是指钱，而是回馈些非物质的东西
Not the money, but something.

349
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:44,999
眼下这就是我们施展拳脚的机会
So here is our chance to kick some ass for Mother Earth.

我选第三个
I pick number three.

354
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:55,384
您不先读读再做决定吗？
You don't wanna read them first?

355
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,218
我当总统是为了"领导"不是为了"读议案" 我选第三个！
I was eIected to Iead, not to read. Number three!

356
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,826

我们被封在圆盖里了！

要是进来就被关在这儿 要是出去就孤零零一个人
If I stay, I'm trapped. If I Ieave, I'm aIone.

我还没亲眼见过威尼斯
I never saw Venice.

362

大家注意！ 有重要事件向大家宣布

我刚刚改进了一台喷酸式超级无敌钻孔机
I have just perfected an acid-firing super-driII. . .

就在圆盖外面

除此之外别无他法

你是说我们象老鼠一样被困这儿了？
You mean we're trapped Iike rats?

不，想困住老鼠可不这么容易 你们更象是…胡萝卜
No, rats can 't be trapped this easily, You're trapped like carrots,

00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:04,229
连累我们受困圆盖的罪魁祸首… 还是没有任何进展
,,,caused our entrapment have been fruitless,

420
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,320
但是不久之前…
Until moments ago!

斯普林菲尔德湖有了令人震惊的发现
A shocking discovery has been made here at Lake Springfield,

422
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:14,077
用这种猪便便罐子的人多得是…
That couId be anybody's pig-crap siIo.

423
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:17,085
送回荷马・辛普森（无偿）

424
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:21,829
荷马，原来是你干的！
Homer, it was you.

425
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,718
你将这个镇子置于死地啊！
You singIe-handedIy kiIIed this town.

426

我知道，这好奇怪

427
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:30,803
提醒大家，我们电视台并不鼓励 义务警员行使正义
Just a reminder, this station does not endorse vigilante justice,

428
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,637
除非能将罪犯绳之以法，而这是迟早的事
Unless it gets results, Which it will,

429
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:39,523
你根本不把我的警告当回事
You didn't Iisten to me after I warned you.

430
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:43,268
别担心，这种无聊节目没人看的
Don't worry, nobody watches this stupid show.

431
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:45,693
远处那些不详之光是怎么回事？
What's that ominous gIow in the distance?

432
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,989
杀！杀！杀无赦！
Kill! Kill! Kill!

433
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:03,586
玛吉，快来看啊！ 那帮蠢蛋连我们住哪儿都不知道
Marge, Iook. Those idiots don't even know where we Iive.

亲爱的，别这样，眼下还有更棘手的事

但是…我好生气
But I'm so angry.

440
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:23,808
你是女人，你要克制满腔怒火
You're a woman. You can hoId on to it forever.

00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,684
好吧
Okay.

442
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,319
荷马，你得出去，面对大家…

443
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:33,823
…为你的所作所为道歉
. . .and apoIogize for what you did.

444
00:33:34,037 --> 00:33:37,287
我会的，但是我担心一开门 他们连你和孩子都不放过
I wouId, but I'm afraid if I open the door, they'II take aII of you.

445
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,491
不会的，我们只要荷马！
No, we won't. We just want Homer!

446
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,915
也许不是你们，但是他们会杀了爷爷
WeII, maybe not you, but they'II kiII Grampa.

我来帮你点上

爬过来！快点！
CrawI across. Hurry.

453
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,629
要是被发现，他们会杀了你的
But if they see you heIping us, they'II kiII you.

454
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:33,464
我肯定你爸也会这么…
I'm sure your father wouId do the same for--

00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:45,345
我的箭是红色的 这样就知道谁是我的箭下冤魂
I'm using a red arrow so I know who I kiII.

458
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:52,941
不要！波洛特！ 要是再推，爸爸的小命就不保了

哈，终于开始转运咯

462
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:25,770
- 拿了什么？ - 我们的婚礼录像
-What'd you get? -Our wedding video.

463
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:29,474
- 我们居然有婚礼录像？ - 点燃煤气筒

帮我一把？
LittIe heIp?

468
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:07,683
要知道，"道歉"这个词…
You know, the word ''apoIogy'' . . .

469
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:13,603
…现在到处泛滥 不过当它发自内心…
. . .is tossed around a Iot these days, but when it comes from in here--

00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,132
我听不见！
I can't hear you!

480
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,101
（献给丽莎的歌）

481
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:27,694
我从不曾幻想会经历如此完美时刻 但现在…
I never thought my Iife wouId have an absoIuteIy perfect moment, but this is--

482
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:31,410

Lisa's got a boyfriend that she'II never see again!

483
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,499
太完美了
--perfect.

484
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:48,837
- 我们该怎么办？ - 逃跑
-What do we do? -Now we run.

485
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:54,352
很遗憾叫他们跑了，先生
I'm afraid we Iost them, sir.

486
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:55,891
见鬼！
Damn it!

487
00:38:56,106 --> 00:38:59,023
那就快把他们找回来！把他们丢进圆盖里！
WeII, then, you find them and you get them back in the dome.

488
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:00,645
别再叫其他人跑出来
And so nobody eIse gets out. . .

489
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,530
派人24小时守在那里！

And here's how I want them arranged: Tough, tough, soft, tough. . .

00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,074

. . .soft, soft, tough, tough, soft, soft, tough, soft.

494
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,628
先生，您都被手上的职权搞得抓狂了
Sir, I'm afraid you've gone mad with power.

495
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,836
当然了！无权无势能抓狂吗？ 那样就太无聊了，根本没人搭理你
Of course. Ever try going mad without power? It's boring. No one Iistens to you.

496
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:57,289
- 巴特，你在喝威士忌？ - 我现在心烦！
-Bart, are you drinking whiskey? -I'm troubIed.

小子，你给我回来！
You come back here, IittIe man.

500
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:15,516
我好想佛兰德斯！听到没？我想他！

501
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,934
- 你爸哪去了？ - 出去了
-Where's your father? -He went out.

Hey, guys?

504

敲门暗号是什么来着？
What's the secret knock, again?

505
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:31,774
听着，我知道都是我惹的祸，这是大麻烦
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

超级大麻烦！ 我们无家可归！

所有的朋友都惦记着杀我们！
Our friends wanna kiII us!

508
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:39,280
你要是还想和我们过日子…
Before we can even stay in the same room with you. . .

509
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,956
…现在就老实告诉我 你脑子究竟在想什么？
. . .I need to know what was going through your mind. . .

510
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,458
…把我的话当耳旁风
. . .when you didn't Iisten to me. . .

511
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:48,171
居然把罐子扔到湖里…
. . .and dumped that siIo in the Iake.

512
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:49,630
荷马！
Homer!

513
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:53,462
我不知道该怎么回答，玛芝！ 我做事不动脑子！
I don't know what to teII you, Marge. I don't think about things.

514
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,804
我敬佩那些动脑袋想问题的人，可是…
I respect peopIe who do. . .

515
00:40:56,016 --> 00:41:01,521
我只想不伤害任何人 能安安稳稳的与你厮守
. . .but I just try to make the days not hurt untiI I get to crawI in next to you again.

516
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:05,389

真的很抱歉，不仅仅只是抱歉…
Look, I'm reaIIy sorry. But I'm more than just sorry. . .

518
00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:11,815
…我已经想好了解决方案
. . .I'm prepared with a soIution.

519
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:16,619
我总是担心自己把生活搞砸 对此留有后路，以备不时之需
I've aIways been afraid I'd screw up our Iives so badIy we'd need a backup pIan.

520
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:21,534
那个方案就在这里！
And that pIan is right here!

521

（阿拉斯加――崭新的开始）

527
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:38,929
阿拉斯加？

528
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:43,092
阿拉斯加，一个不会超重 不会酩酊大醉的地方
AIaska. A pIace where you can't be too fat or too drunk.

529
00:41:43,313 --> 00:41:44,973
一个没人在乎
Where no one says things Iike:

530
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,559
"高中毕业证"的地方
''Let's see your high schooI equivaIency certificate. ''

531
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:50,902
我不确定，荷马
I don't know, Homie.

532
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:53,531
我说的不是很恰当
I'm not saying it right.

533
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,441
这样想吧 我无法独自一人开始新生活
Look, the thing is, I can't start a new Iife aIone.

而且我真的开始喜欢你们这帮家伙了！
And I've reaIIy come to Iike you guys.

535
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:04,822
我真的看不出来
I just don't see it.

536
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:12,539
玛芝，婚姻生活中你只有一次机会说…
Marge, in every marriage, you get one chance to say:

537
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:15,001
"我需要与你同心协力"
''I need you to do this with me. ''

538
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:20,971
而这句话的回应也是唯一的
And there's onIy one answer when somebody says that.

539
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:29,725
好吧，荷马，我们一起同甘共苦

没有钱，我们怎么去阿拉斯加？
How are we supposed to get to AIaska without any money?

547

儿子，要是你不相信我 那就相信美国梦吧
AII right, son. If you don't beIieve in me, beIieve in America.

- 有什么蹊跷吧？ - 没有
-What's the catch? -No catch.

552
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:12,437
只要一次性开着这辆摩托到球顶就算赢
Just ride the motorcycIe aII the way around just one time.

553
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:14,728
三次机会，10块钱

And that's three.

558
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:34,756
这样吧，我喜欢看你摔得这么惨
Here's what I'II do, because I Iike seeing you hurt yourseIf:

559
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,424
再免费给你试一次
I'II give you one on the house.

560
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:38,461
- 你太好了 - 爸！
-You're the best. -Dad!

561
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:42,343
到球顶的时候别减速，加速！
When you get to the top, don't sIow down, speed up!

562
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:45,510
- 但我好怕！ - 听我的没错！
-But that's when it's the scariest. -Just do it!

563
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:59,149
耶！
Yes!

564
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:03,157
耶，爸！
Yay, Dad!

565
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:12,415
现在把卡车给我吧
I'II take that truck now.

566
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:17,580
天，我老婆会杀了我的
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kiII me.

567
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:23,378
下一站，阿拉斯加！
Next stop, AIaska!

568
00:44:29,186 --> 00:44:31,178
圆盖下，第37天
Day 37 under the dome,

569
00:44:31,396 --> 00:44:35,264
我们正面临间歇性断电…
We are facing intermittent power failures which--

570
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:41,653
好啦，闹够了，我把灯再关上
Okay, very funny. I'm gonna turn the Iights off again.

571
00:44:41,865 --> 00:44:44,949
等灯一亮，酒要给我物归原处
When they come back on, I want aII my booze back the way it was.

572
00:44:49,623 --> 00:44:52,707
好啦，这下好啦
Yeah, okay. Okay.

573
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:03,380
我为你自豪，巴特，才一天你就清醒了
I'm very proud of you, Bart. Over 24 hours sober.

574
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:05,884
- 你酒醒了吧？ - 我来证明给你看
-You are, aren't you? -I'II prove it.

575
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:15,685
给你爸爸一个改过的机会 我们现在只是…
We're giving your father another chance, and we owe it to him to--

576
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:18,567
- 哦，天啊！ - 需要什么吗？
-Oh, my God. -Can I heIp you?

577
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:22,606
我…我们要尿布
We need diapers.

578
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:25,029
- 好的 - 等一下，不要了，我们不要了
-Okay. -No. No, we don't. We don't.

579
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:27,151
- 要女士剃刀 - 好的
-Ladies' razorbIades. -Right.

580
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:31,366
不，不要了 差点忘了，我们欧洲人不用那个的
No! No. No, we don't. I forgot, we're European.

581
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:33,326
我们要牛肉干
Just give us beef jerky.

582
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,293
好多好多牛肉干
Lots and Iots of beef jerky.

583
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:39,373
对，我们就要这个
That's right. That's what we need. That's aII we came in for.

584
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:40,917
当然
Sure.

585
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,467
哦，天啊！他们在那！
Oh, my God. There they are!

586
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:06,449
（欢乐假期――蒙弟、波兹）

587
00:46:06,074 --> 00:46:09,988
你们想向我要电，是吗？
So you want some of my eIectricity, do you?

588
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:14,573
暴富白人总算是掌权了！
WeII, for once, the rich white man is in controI.

589
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,914
我桌子这儿有两个钮
I have two buttons behind this desk.

590
00:46:17,126 --> 00:46:21,753
一个是你们需要的电源 另一个是放狗咬人
One wiII suppIy your town with power, the other reIeases the hounds.

591
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:24,752
说吧，看你们能不能打动我
Reach me. Make me your brother.

592
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:27,167
医院的发电机快不行了
The hospitaI's generator is about to give out.

593
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:28,631
很多人要丧生
Lives wiII be Iost.

594
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:32,589
生命、死亡，继续
''Lives Iost. '' Go on.

595
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:35,928
明天有宴会，要做菜，但是没电不成啊
We got a convict we were gonna fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

596
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:38,517
美味，诱惑啊
Tempting. Tempting.

597
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:40,439
我们说什么都无足轻重
Look, aII our reasons mean nothing.

598
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,350
你扪心自问，自然就会发现答案
Just Iook into your heart and you'II find the answer.

599
00:46:47,823 --> 00:46:50,658
- 右手边第一道门 - 谢谢
-First door on the right. -Thank you.

600
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:02,499
什么？这根本不是我想象中的阿拉斯加！
What--? This isn't the way I pictured AIaska at aII!

601
00:47:02,713 --> 00:47:04,172
现在这样好多了
Oh, that's better.

602
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,125
荷马！
Homer!

603
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:15,391
好在我的画报没弄坏
WeII, at Ieast my poster didn't get torn.

604
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,773
欢迎来阿拉斯加，这是给您的1000块钱
WeIcome to AIaska. Here's $ 1 000.

605
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,563
真是雪中送炭啊！可为什么呢？
WeII, it's about time! But why?

606
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,742
我们给每位来访的公民1000块钱…
We pay every resident $ 1 000. . .

607
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,871
…以便他们支持石油公司 大肆破坏国家级自然风光
. . .to aIIow oiI companies to ravage our state's naturaI beauty.

608
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:40,157
我终于来到了这片乐土！
I'm home!

609
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,249
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

610
00:47:51,553 --> 00:47:53,638
（辛普森家）

611
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:01,519
你干嘛呢，巴特？
What are you doing, Bart?

612
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,189
不过是消磨时间罢了
Just passing the time.

613
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:20,411
我儿子太爱阿拉斯加了 他正鼓掌欢呼呢！
My boy Ioves AIaska so much, he's appIauding it.

614
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:23,079
- 丽莎，你怎么不一起鼓掌？ - 但是，爸…
-Lisa, why aren't you cIapping? -But, Dad--

615
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,752
为阿拉斯加鼓掌！
CIap for AIaska!

616
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:46,314
玛芝，这堵雪墙成就了我们的二人世界
WeII, Marge, we're separated from the kids by a waII of snow.

617
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:50,273
我终于美梦成真了
AII my dreams are coming true.

618
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,010
我们需要更多的鸟
We're going to need more birds.

619
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,331
圆盖下的第93天
Day 93 under the dome.

620
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:48,831
现在物资极其匮乏…
With necessities growing dangerousIy Iow. . .

621
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:51,998
…谁知道接下来会发生什么呢？
. . .who knows what spark wiII set off this powder keg?

622
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:55,630
- 好了，我们来讨论"与莫里共度周二" - 还讨论？
-Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie, -Again?

623
00:49:55,843 --> 00:49:58,512
要是再不讨论新书，就要令我作呕了
If we don't get a new book, I'm going to puke.

624
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:02,386
你这个要下地狱的恶魔！
You're the five peopIe I'm going to meet in heII!

625
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:04,289
（匿名酒精俱乐部）

626
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:06,344
我们没有咖啡啦！
We're out of coffee!

627
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,731
这个圆盖我一分钟都待不下去了！
I can't take another minute in this dome!

628
00:50:22,578 --> 00:50:24,452
接着
Take that.

629
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,289
不，又反弹回来了
Oh, no! BIowback!

630
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:32,233
（卡吉尔牌监视摄像头）

631
00:50:32,754 --> 00:50:34,414
看看他们是怎么对待圆盖的
Look what they're doing to our dome.

632
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:43,300
总统，您知道那是什么吗？
You know what that is, sir?

633
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:45,223
- 裂缝？ - 没错
-A crack? -ExactIy.

634
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:48,600
之前有人从圆盖跑出来过 所以这事迟早还会再发生
PeopIe got out of the dome before, they're gonna get out again.

635
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,647
如果发生，接下来的 就是听证会、深入调查
When they do, there's gonna be hearings, investigations. . . .

636
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,605
天啊！那我就得接着去干老本行 拍家庭喜剧
I'II have to go back to making famiIy comedies.

637
00:50:57,612 --> 00:50:59,652
别担心，我有解决方案，总统先生
Don't worry, I have a soIution for you, sir.

638
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:02,403
事实上，我有五套方案
In fact, I have five soIutions.

639
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:05,073
您不用逐字逐句的阅读，您可以进行否决
You don't have to read them. You'II have deniabiIity.

640
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:07,078
这事就交由我全权负责，您不用操心
I'II take care of it. You know nothing.

641
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:10,080
不，我得知道要批准的行动
No. I need to know what I'm approving.

642
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:14,206
当然了！但是换句话说… 掌握真相这事总被夸大其词
AbsoIuteIy. But on the other hand, knowing things is overrated.

643
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,746
了解事实真相后，傻子也能做出判断
Anyone can pick something when they know what it is.

644
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:20,298
对于真正的领袖来说，其高明之处在于 在全然未知的情况下做出决策
It takes reaI Ieadership to pick something you're cIueIess about.

645
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:22,928
- 好啦，那我选三号 - 再重选一次
-Okay, I pick three. -Try again.

646
00:51:23,138 --> 00:51:24,929
- 一号，五号？ - 选个大点的数，太大了
-One. Five? -Go higher. Too high.

647
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,254
- 三号 - 你之前选过了
-Three? -You said three.

648
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:28,266
- 六号，二号 - 没六号，加倍
-Six? Two? -There is no six. DoubIe it.

649
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:29,805
- 四号 - 那就听您的，总统
-Four! -As you wish, sir.

650
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:37,193
（四号方案：炸平斯普林菲尔德）

651
00:51:42,574 --> 00:51:46,025
你是否对一成不变的大峡谷感到厌倦？
Are you tired of the same old Grand Canyon?

652
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:49,115
我们到了，孩子们，这里就是大峡谷
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

653
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:53,660
好破，真无聊啊 我想要个新的，现在就要！
It's so oId and boring. I want a new one. Now!

654
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,000
你们好啊，我是汤姆・汉克斯
HeIIo. I'm Tom Hanks.

655
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:58,501
美国政府已经失信于民
The U.S. government has Iost its credibiIity. . .

656
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,375
…所以不得不借用我的威名
. . .so it's borrowing some of mine.

657
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:01,967
摸摸我的头发，汉克斯先生
TousIe my hair, Mr. Hanks.

658
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:04,134
没问题，孩子
Sure thing, son.

659
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:08,973
现在我荣幸的向大家介绍崭新的大峡谷
Now, I'm pIeased to teII you aII about the New Grand Canyon.

660
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,682

This weekend, East of Shelbyville and south of Capitol City,

661
00:52:13,187 --> 00:52:14,765
那是斯普林菲尔德所在地！
That's where SpringfieId is!

662
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:17,353
这将是你闻所未闻的新景观
It's nowhere near where anything is or ever was.

663
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,729
这是汤姆・汉克斯的心声
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

664
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:21,944
选择值得信任的政府…为什么不选我呢？
If you're going to pick a government to trust, why not this one?

665
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:23,484
你们看到了吗？
Did you see that?

666
00:52:23,698 --> 00:52:26,403
是的，他们打算将斯普林菲尔德夷为平地！
Yes, they're going to destroy SpringfieId.

667
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:28,361
不过我们会阻止他们
But we're going to stop them.

668
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,365
荷马，穿好衣服了吗？荷马
Homie, get your cIothes on. Homie?

669
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,869
我喜欢这里，叫斯普林菲尔德见鬼去吧！
I'm happy here. Screw SpringfieId!

670
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:38,371
不敢相信你会这么自私
I can't beIieve you'd say something so seIfish.

671
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,754
玛芝，那帮人拿着草叉火把追赶我们
Marge, those peopIe chased us with pitchforks and torches.

672
00:52:41,966 --> 00:52:44,338
火把啊，居然下午四点就点火把
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

673
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:47,339
- 那时是晚上七点 - 那时正在播《走进好莱坞》
-It was 7 at night. -It was during Access Hollywood,

674
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,382
那节目四点、七点都播
Which is on at 4 and 7.

675
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:53,426
爸，你怎么能对 那些爱我们的人置之不理呢？
Dad, how can you turn your back on everyone who Ioved us?

676
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,436
我们有麻烦的时候 佛兰德斯可是挺身相助的
FIanders heIped when we were in troubIe.

677
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:57,686
谁在乎佛兰德斯干过什么？ 他又不是你老爸！
Who cares what he did? He's not your father.

678
00:52:57,898 --> 00:52:59,061
我倒希望他是！
I wish he was.

679
00:52:59,275 --> 00:53:01,267
你在说气话，你崇拜我
You don't mean that. You worship me.

680
00:53:01,485 --> 00:53:03,810
哦，是吗？ 那看看我把你的照片怎么着了
Oh, yeah? Look what I did to your picture.

681
00:53:04,488 --> 00:53:05,484
看看啊
Look at it.

682
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,566
灵不灵，灵不灵
How-diIIy-doo-diIIy. How-diIIy-doo-diIIy.

683
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:09,242
为什么，你这个小…！
Why, you IittIe--!

684
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:11,786
我掐死你！
I'II strangIe-angIe you!

685
00:53:11,996 --> 00:53:13,276
看我的
DiddiIy-diddiIy.

686
00:53:13,497 --> 00:53:15,822
巴特，别这样！看我的
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

687
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:18,911
荷马…
Homer. . .

688
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:22,996
…婚姻生活中你只有一次机会说 "我需要与你同心协力"
. . .in every marriage, you get one chance to say:

689
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:26,299
"我需要与你同心协力"
''I need you to do this with me. ''

690
00:53:27,761 --> 00:53:31,462
这是我听过最傻的蠢话
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

691
00:53:31,682 --> 00:53:32,844
荷马・辛普森！
Homer Simpson!

692
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:34,600
我们要拯救斯普林菲尔德！
We're saving SpringfieId!

693
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,968
你们都给我听好！我们就待在这儿！
Listen to me, aII of you. We are staying.

694
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:38,729

…绝不会再踏入美国一步！
. . .and we're never going back to America again.

696
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:44,358
我说完了！
I have spoken!

697
00:53:52,014 --> 00:53:54,100
（侠盗海象）

698
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:09,124
让他们提心吊胆够了
WeII, I guess I've Iet her worry about me Iong enough.

699
00:54:21,148 --> 00:54:23,852
玛芝？孩子？
Marge? Kids?

700
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:31,220
（请用录像机播放）

701
00:54:37,205 --> 00:54:39,079
好啦
Okay, here goes,

702
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,666
荷马…

703
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,833
…我总是支持你
,,,I've always stood up for you,

704
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:46,164
当别人指责你的错误缺点时…
When people point out your flaws,,,

705
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:48,172
…我总是说
,,,I always say:

706
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:53,460
只要变换个角度看待 就能体会到荷马的真诚
''Well, sometimes you have to stand back to appreciate a work of art, ''

707
00:54:54,722 --> 00:54:56,217
大角度
Way back.

708
00:54:56,432 --> 00:54:59,683
可最近，我只能靠忽略你的所作所为…
Lately, what's keeping us together,,,

709
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:04,141
…来维系我们之间的感情
,,,is my ability to overlook everything you do,

710
00:55:04,357 --> 00:55:08,106
之所以忽略，是因为…
And I overlook these things because,,,,

711
00:55:08,444 --> 00:55:09,689
是因为？
Because?

712
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:12,855
这就是问题所在
Well, that's the thing,

713
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:17,321
我不知道该怎么把话说完
I just don 't know how to finish that sentence anymore,

714
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:21,905
现在我带着孩子们 回去帮助斯普林菲尔德
So I'm leaving with the kids to help Springfield,,,

715
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:24,746
…我们不会再回来了
,,,and we're never coming back,

716
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,504
为了说服我自己这就是我们的结局
And to prove to myself that this is the end,,,

717
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,628
…我用现在的这段画面 覆盖了我们的结婚录像
,,,I taped this over our wedding video,

718
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:40,055
再见了，荷马
Goodbye, Homie,

719
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:56,199
我爱你
I love you,

720
00:55:59,745 --> 00:56:02,201
玛芝？孩子？
Marge? Kids?

721
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:24,144
（未完待续…）

722
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:27,690
（马上开始…）

723
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,504
- 妈，我们有什么计划？ - 你在那上面干什么？
-So, Mom, what's our pIan? -What are you doing up there?

724
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,427
我在翻大家的行李
Looking through peopIe's Iuggage.

725
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:02,555
我是恶魔公司的吉祥物
I'm the mascot of an eviI corporation.

726
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:06,265
你给我下来！我们要低调一点…
Get down from there. We have to keep a Iow profiIe. . .

727
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:10,558
在到达西雅图向世人宣布 摧毁斯普林菲尔德的阴谋之前
. . .tiII we get to SeattIe to teII the worId of the pIot to destroy SpringfieId.

728
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:13,265
你们是不是不应该这么大声说这事啊？
I don't know if you guys shouId be taIking so Ioud.

729
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:17,779
丽莎，政府不会监听公民对话的
Oh, Lisa, it's not Iike the government is Iistening to everybody's conversation.

730
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:22,953
（国家安全局）

731
00:57:26,122 --> 00:57:28,448
嘿，我要谈谈你们的"肉欲情人"匹萨
Hi, I'm calling about your Meat Lover's pizza,

732
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:31,786
我喜欢吃肉，可是不确定是否会重投爱河
I like meat, but I don 't know if I'm ready to love again,

733
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:35,253
- 你先挂电话 - 不，你先
-You hang up first, -No, you hang up first,

734
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:36,794
好吧
Okay,

735
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:38,835
她居然挂我电话！
She hung up on me!

736
00:57:39,052 --> 00:57:43,381
我们现在是逃犯 在到达西雅图前要低调
But we're fugitives, We should just lay low till we get to Seattle,

737
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:45,467
嘿，我找到了！
Hey, everybody, I found one!

738
00:57:45,684 --> 00:57:49,551
政府居然成功找到了缉拿的罪犯！
The government actuaIIy found someone we're Iooking for!

739
00:57:49,771 --> 00:57:51,598
哇！太好啦！

740
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:54,603
荷马・辛普森…
Homer Simpson. . .

741
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:58,361
…知道为什么你会身处此地吗？
. . .do you know why you are here?

742
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:02,486
因为我家人关心外人胜过亲人
Because my famiIy cares more about other peopIe than they do about me.

743
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,073
把这个喝下去

现在我们要通过古老的…
Now we wiII cIeanse your spirit. . .

746
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:15,330
因纽特"甩腔"唤回你古老的灵魂
. . .by the ancient Inuit art of throat singing.

747
00:58:15,546 --> 00:58:17,669
甩腔？
Throat singing?

748
00:58:28,226 --> 00:58:29,803
要唱多久？
How Iong are we doing this?

749
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:33,770
直到你拥有"艾辟福尼"为止 好吧
-UntiI you have an epiphany. -Okay.
-UntiI you have an epiphany. -Okay.

750
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:38,266
艾辟福尼是什么？
What's an epiphany?

751
00:58:38,486 --> 00:58:41,522
突然间的大彻大悟
Sudden reaIization of great truth.

752
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:42,735
好吧
Okay.

753
00:58:57,296 --> 00:59:00,879
蜘蛛猪，蜘蛛猪

施展浑身解数，尽显蜘蛛猪神威
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

755
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:05,793
当心啊
Look out!

756

它是蜘蛛猪
He's a Spider-Pig

757
00:59:11,769 --> 00:59:13,892
除非你拥有"艾辟福尼"…
UnIess you have an epiphany. . .

758
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:18,019
…否则你将孤独一生

759
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:21,349
艾辟福尼，艾辟福尼
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

760
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:25,522
哦，我知道了，香蕉是钾化物的重要原料
Bananas are an exceIIent source of potassium.

761
00:59:27,493 --> 00:59:30,363
美国永远不会痴迷足球？
Americans wiII never embrace soccer?

762
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:35,415
打了我这么多下，你们在自娱自乐吗？
More than two shakes and it's pIaying with yourseIf?

763
00:59:38,128 --> 00:59:40,251
你们要干什么？
Hey, what are you doing?

764
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:48,593
随你们干什么吧，我都不在乎了
Oh, do whatever you want to me. I don't care about myseIf anymore.

765
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:52,763
因为…？
Because,,, ?

766
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:57,771
因为其他人和我同样重要
Because other peopIe are just as important as me.

767
00:59:58,148 --> 01:00:02,276
没有他们，我就一文不名
Without them, I'm nothing.

768
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:07,440
只有拯救斯普林菲尔德…
In order to save myseIf. . .

769
01:00:07,658 --> 01:00:10,196
…才能完成自我救赎！
. . .I have to save SpringfieId!

770
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,281
就是这样，是不是？
That's it! Isn't it?

771
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:28,802
刚才的经历真是不可思议
That was the most incredibIe experience of my Iife.

772
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:34,219
现在我要拯救我的家人、我的城镇 还要再减掉10磅体重！
And now to find my famiIy, save my town and drop 1 0 pounds!

773
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,303
太感谢你了，大奶婆！
Thank you, boob Iady.

774
01:00:44,027 --> 01:00:47,147
我们到了，孩子们，这就是西雅图
This is it, kids. SeattIe.

775
01:00:47,364 --> 01:00:50,364
罗斯・卡吉尔！你觉得他看到我们了吗？
Russ CargiII! Do you think he saw us?

776
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,662
是的，我看到了

777
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:02,328
跑！快跑！

784
01:01:18,937 --> 01:01:21,013
好啦，我知道大家今天都很辛苦…
Now, I know we've had a rough day. . .

785
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,184
…不过我相信大家可以克服这些困难
. . .but I'm sure we can put aII that behind us and--

786
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:28,938
不要咬挥鞭的胳膊啊！
That's my whipping arm!

787
01:01:32,075 --> 01:01:35,740
为什么我鞭打的东西最终都要离我而去呢？
Why does everything I whip Ieave me?

788
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,208
继续走，继续走
Must keep going. Must keep going.

789
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:45,367
不，我不行了，我走不动了
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

790
01:01:45,588 --> 01:01:47,664
走！你能行的！
Yes, you can.

791
01:01:47,882 --> 01:01:49,673
不，我不行了
No, I can't!

792
01:01:49,884 --> 01:01:51,544
闭嘴吧！
Oh, shut up!

793
01:01:51,761 --> 01:01:53,338
你闭嘴
You shut up.

794
01:01:53,554 --> 01:01:55,381
不，你，不，你
No, you. No, you.

795
01:01:55,598 --> 01:01:58,385
不，你！哦，你真行
No, you. Oh, reaI mature.

796
01:01:58,601 --> 01:02:00,890
你怎么这么说？
How couId you say that?

797
01:02:01,103 --> 01:02:03,096
有什么意义呢？
Oh, what's the point?

798
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:05,639
帮帮我
It's hopeIess.

799
01:02:13,616 --> 01:02:17,198
别放弃，荷马，道路并非你想象般艰难
Don't give up, Homer. You are cIoser than you think.

800
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:19,036
但我该往哪边走呢？
But which way do I go?

801
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,251
多谢
Much obIiged.

803
01:02:47,983 --> 01:02:50,142
丽莎，别吹了！
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

804
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,356
丽莎！
Lisa!

805
01:02:53,614 --> 01:02:57,279
他们抓住了我家人！ 我该怎么办？我该怎么办？
They captured my famiIy. What do I do? What do I do?

806
01:03:03,498 --> 01:03:06,286
那个停车牌看着有点奇怪
There's something strange about that ''sop'' sign.

807
01:03:24,436 --> 01:03:26,559
- 你听到什么动静了吗？ - 可能是老鼠
-Did you hear something? -ProbabIy just a moth.

808
01:03:26,772 --> 01:03:28,182
但愿没事
I hope it's okay.

809
01:03:40,306 --> 01:03:42,808
（硬石馆）

810
01:03:52,464 --> 01:03:55,915
我们不能见个指示牌就停，接着开吧
Look, we can't keep stopping at every ''sop,'' ''yeId'' or ''one vay'' sign.

811
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:57,332
接着开吧
Just move on.

812
01:04:03,475 --> 01:04:05,135
放我们出去！放我们出去！
Let us out! Let us out!

813
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:07,510
停下来！会把手铐弄坏的！
Stop that. You'II scratch your shackIes.

814
01:04:07,729 --> 01:04:09,768
那样就好了！
I hope I do.

815
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:19,274
哦，你干的好事，巴特
Oh, way to go, Bart.

816
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,866
你好臭
You stink.

817
01:04:21,075 --> 01:04:24,824
不，你才臭
No, you stink.

818
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:41,838
斯普林菲尔德
SpringfieId.

819
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,505
难以置信，这里更破了
I can't beIieve it, but it got even crappier.

820
01:04:44,953 --> 01:04:45,892
（猪油劳甜甜圈）

821
01:04:45,892 --> 01:04:47,247
（喧嚣地游乐中心）

822
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:49,020
（斯普林菲尔德小学）

823
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,395
哦，天！
Oh, man.

824
01:05:00,114 --> 01:05:01,193
嗨，玛芝
Oh, hi, Midge.

825
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:03,483
荷马，到底怎么回事？
Moe, what happened?

826
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:08,162
圆盖将这里与世隔绝 所以情况有点复杂困惑
With the town seaIed off from the rest of the worId, things got a IittIe nutty here.

827
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:09,748
你干嘛穿成这样？
Why are you dressed Iike that?

828
01:05:09,957 --> 01:05:14,370
我不想自吹自擂，不过… 我现在是斯普林菲尔德的新君主
WeII, I don't Iike to brag, but I am now the emperor of SpringfieId.

829
01:05:14,587 --> 01:05:15,915
不，你不是！
No, you're not!

830
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,419
我就是！
Yes, I am!

831
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:22,207
好吧，君主万岁
Okay. HaiI, emperor.

832
01:05:22,428 --> 01:05:24,467
斯普林菲尔德，请注意
Attention, Springfield,

833
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:30,143
政府意识到把你们笼罩于此是个弥天大错
Your government realized that putting you inside this dome was a terrible mistake,

834
01:05:30,352 --> 01:05:33,686
所以我们将采取"翔鹰"计划
Therefore, we're commencing with Operation Soaring Eagle,

835
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,941
其中包括将你们全部歼灭
Which involves killing you all,

836
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,150
我讲话的同时，一个看似微小 却威力无比的炸弹已经启动
As I speak, we're lowering a small but powerful bomb into your midst,

837
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:02,121
尽管过去发生的不愉快 但我好想念你爸爸
Despite everything, I miss your father.

838
01:06:02,342 --> 01:06:04,002
我也是
Me too.

839
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:06,889
这时候他的大屁股能把我们都遮住
His big, fat ass couId shieId us aII.

840
01:06:11,476 --> 01:06:12,472
立正！
Ten-hut!

841
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:17,555
稍息， 我是马力・斯维奇将军…
At ease. I'm GeneraI Marriott Suites. . .
