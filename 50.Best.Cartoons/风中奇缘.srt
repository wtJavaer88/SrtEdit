没有John Smith 你别想和印第安人打交道!
You can't fight Indians without John Smith.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,000

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,680
我知道那一定暗示着什么东西
I know it means something.

157
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,150
但就是不知道具体是什么
I just don't know what.

158
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,280
你应该向你父亲问问这件事
You should ask your father about it.

159
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,620
也许是该问问他
Maybe I should.

160
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,960
上来 Flit
Come on, Flit.

161
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,320
不要再到处乱玩 我们得回去了
Quit playing around. We have to get back.

162
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,260
...面对着一个坚定的敌人
...faced a determined enemy.

163
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,270
战斗从太阳刚刚升起
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun

164
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,970
一直持续到夜幕降临
until the evening shadows fell.

165
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,480
我们的战士勇往直前
Our warriors fought with courage,

166
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,980
但是还没人像Kocoum这般勇敢...
but none as bravely as Kocoum...

167
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,980
因为他战斗像熊一样的凶猛
for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear.

168
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,540
他的实际行动证明了他就是我们中最棒的...
He has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors...

169
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,280
- 哦 他可真帅啊! - 我特别喜欢他的微笑
- Oh, he is so handsome! - I especially love his smile.

170
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,850
消灭每一个阻挡他的敌人
Destroying every enemy in his path.

171
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,520
今晚 我们要为他举行盛宴
Tonight we will feast in his honour.

172
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,990
- 宝贝女儿 - 一切安好 父亲
- My daughter. - Wing-gap-o, Father.

173
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,200
见到你就是我最大的快乐
Seeing you gives me great joy.

174
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,030
真高兴您平安回家
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

175
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,530
跟我来 我有太多话要对你说
Come with me. We have much to talk about.

176
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,270
我要听听你做的每一件事情
I want to hear everything you've been doing.

177
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,410
父亲 好几个晚上...
Father, for many nights now...

178
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,820
我都做到同一个奇怪的梦
I've been having a very strange dream.

179
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,220
我想那是要告诉我 什么事将要发生
I think it's telling me something's about to happen.

180
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,620
一件激动人心的事
Something exciting.

181
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,680
没错 是有一件激动人心的事即将发生
Yes, something exciting is about to happen.

182
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,330
真的吗? 那是什么?
Really? What is it?

183
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,030
Kocoum已经向我提亲 他要和你结婚
Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.

184
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,560
嫁给Kocoum?
Marry Kocoum?

185
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,900
我告诉他那会让我心情飞扬
I told him it would make my heart soar.

186
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,810
但是 他太... 严肃了
But he's so... serious.

187
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,940
我的女儿 Kocoum将会是一个好丈夫
My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband.

188
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,540
他既忠诚又强壮 会用结实的墙壁为你建造...
He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house...

189
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,210
一所好房子
with sturdy walls.

190
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,190
和他在一起 你会很安全
With him, you will be safe from harm.

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,720
父亲 我想我的梦 正在指引我走向另一条路
Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.

192
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,420
这对你来说是一条正确的路
This is the right path for you.

193
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,090
但是为什么我就没有选择的...
But why can't I choose...

194
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,100
Pocahontas 跟我来
Pocahontas, come with me.

195
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,170
你是酋长的女儿
You are the daughter of the chief.

196
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,640
是该你履行责任的时候了
It is time to take your place among our people.

197
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,700
即使山野小溪...
Even the wild mountain stream...

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,510
有一天也会流进大河
must someday join the big river.

199
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,180
# 当大河截断他的路 #
# As the river cuts his path #

200
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,090
# 虽然大河骄傲和强壮 #
# Though the river's proud and strong #

201
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,090
# 他也会选择一段最平坦的路程 #
# He will choose the smoothest course #

202
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,970
这就是为什么 大河能活得那么久
That's why rivers live so long.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
# 他们那么稳定 #
# They're steady #

204
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,970
# 稳定得就像打鼓 #
# As the steady beating drum #

205
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,810
你母亲在我们的婚礼上戴着这个
Your mother wore this for our wedding.

206
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,470
看见你亲手戴上是她的梦想
It was her dream to see you wear it at your own.

207
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,750
很配你
It suits you.

208
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,750
他想让我稳定
He wants me to be steady

209
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,460
就像河一样
like the river.

210
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,260
但是他根本就不稳定
But it's not steady at all.

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,900
# 我之所以喜欢大河是因为... #
# What I love most about rivers... #

212
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,570
# 你没办法两次走进同一条河 #
# is you can't step in the same river twice #

213
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,840
# 河水始终在不停地变化 #
# The water's always changing #

214
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,610
# 不断地流动 #
# always flowing #

215
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,610
# 但是人 我猜 不能那样活着 #
# But people, I guess can't live like that. #

216
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,380
# 我们都必须付出代价 #
# We all must pay a price #

217
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,080
# 为了安全 我们甚至失去了去了解 #
# To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing #

218
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,490
# 河湾附近的景色的机会 #
# What's around the river bend #

219
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,860
# 就在河湾附近等待? #
# Waiting just around the river bend? #

220
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,790
# 让我再看一次 #
# I look once more just #

221
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,420
# 就在河湾附近 #
# around the river bend #

222
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,160
# 超越了海岸 #
# Beyond the shore #

223
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,860
# 那里有海鸥自由飞翔 #
# where the gulls fly free #

224
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,990
# 不知道为了什么 #
# Don't know what for #

225
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,060
# 我梦到的那天可能会到来 #
# What I dream the day might send #

226
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,470
# 就在河湾附近 #
# Just around the river bend #

227
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,710
# 为了我 #
# For me #

228
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,310
# 为我而来 #
# Coming for me #

229
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,150
# 我感觉到它就在那儿 树的那边 #
# I feel it there beyond those trees #

230
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,710
# 也在这些水帘背后 #
# or right behind these waterfalls #

231
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,620
# 我能忽视远处的鼓声吗 #
# Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming #

232
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,520
# 为了一个英俊可靠的丈夫 #
# For a handsome sturdy husband #

233
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,690
# 他将为我建造漂亮结实的墙壁 #
# who builds handsome, sturdy walls #

234
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,190
# 然后再也不去想有事将要发生 #
# And never dreams that something might be coming #

235
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,330
# 就在河湾附近 #
# Just around the river bend #

236
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,030
# 就在河湾附近 #
# Just around the river bend #

237
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,010
# 让我再看一次 #
# I look once more #

238
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,810
# 就在河湾附近 #
# just around the river bend #

239
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,710
# 超越了海岸 #
# Beyond the shore #

240
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,440
# 那里就是大海 #
# Somewhere past the sea #

241
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,450
# 不知道为了什么 #
# Don't know what for #

242
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,510
# 为什么我的梦总是那么超前 #
# Why do all my dreams extend #

243
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,110
# 就在河湾附近 #
# Just around the river bend #

244
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,560
# 就在河湾附近 #
# Just around the river bend #

245
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,690
# 我是不是应该选择最平滑的路程 #
# Should I choose the smoothest course #

246
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,030
# 稳定得就像打鼓一样? #
# Steady as the beating drum #

247
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,500
# 我是不是应该嫁给Kocoum?
# Should I marry Kocoum?

248
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,530
# 我所有的梦都了结了 #
# Is all my dreaming at an end #

249
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,480
# 或者你还在 #
# Or do you still #

250
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,150
# 等着我 拖梦人? #
# Wait for me Dream giver? #

251
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,820
# 就在河湾 #
# Just around the river #

252
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:08,860
# 附近? #
# bend? #

253
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,630
是我的Pocahontas吗?
Is that my Pocahontas?

254
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,730
Willow奶奶 我有话对你说
Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you.

255
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,100
早上好 孩子
Good morning, child.

256
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,630
我知道你今天会来
I was hoping you'd visit today.

257
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,230
哦! 你母亲的项链!
Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!

258
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,800
这就是我打算和你说的
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

259
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,180
我父亲想把我嫁给Kocoum
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

260
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,780
Kocoum? 但是他太严肃了
Kocoum? But he's so serious.

261
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,310
我知道 我父亲 认为这是我应该走的路
I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me.

262
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,790
但是最近 我总 在做一个梦 我想它...
But lately, I've been having this dream and I think it's...

263
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,190
哦 一个梦! 让我们来听听!
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it.

264
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,130
安静!
Quiet!

265
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,230
安静!
Quiet!

266
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,170
现在 孩子 你开始说吧
Now, child, you were saying.

267
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,440
恩 我在树林里跑...
Well, I'm running through the woods...

268
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,450
就在我前方出现了 一个箭头
and then, right there in front of me, is an arrow.

269
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,180
当我去看时 它就开始旋转
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

270
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,950
旋转的箭头? 真不寻常
A spinning arrow. How unusual.

271
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,520
是的 它旋转得 越来越快 越来越快
Yes. It spins faster and faster and faster

272
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,360
直到突然间... 停止了
until suddenly... it stops.

273
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,630
恩 看起来这个旋转的箭头...
Well, it seems to me this spinning arrow...

274
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,690
正在指示你应该走的路
is pointing you down your path.

275
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,810
但是 Willow奶奶 我的路到底在哪?
But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path?

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,810
我该怎样去找到它?
How am I ever going to find it?

277
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,540
你母亲问了我同样一个问题
Your mother asked me the very same question.

278
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,980
她也问了? 那你怎么回答她的?
She did? What did you tell her?

279
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,510
我让她去聆听
I told her to listen.

280
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,990
你周围都是生灵 孩子
All around you are spirits, child.

281
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,580
它们生活在泥土里 水里 天上
They live in the earth, the water, the sky.

282
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,060
如果你仔细去聆听 它们会指引你的
If you listen, they will guide you.

283
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,430
我听到风了
I hear the wind.

284
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,770
恩 它告诉你什么?
Yes. What is it telling you?

285
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,400
我不懂
I don't understand.

286
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,540
# 你会明白的 #
# You will understand #

287
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,070
# 用心去聆听 #
# Listen with your heart #

288
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,610
# 你会明白的 #
# You will understand #

289
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,280
# 让它来指引你 #
# Let it break upon you #

290
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,260
# 就像波浪打在沙滩上 #
# Like a wave upon the sand #

291
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,460
它说什么东西来了
It's saying something's coming.

292
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,020
奇怪的云彩?
Strange clouds?

293
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,400
# 用心去聆听 #
# Listen with your heart #

294
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,240
# 你会明白的 #
# You will understand #

295
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,770
你看到了什么?
What do you see?

296
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,080
云彩
Clouds.

297
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,850
奇怪的云彩
Strange clouds.

298
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,550
看看这儿 Wiggins...
Look at it, Wiggins...

299
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,290
一个堆满金子的新世界...
An entire new world chock full of gold...

300
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,460
正等着我
just waiting for me.

301
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,260
还有许多惊险在等着我们 对吗 Percy?
And scores of adventures waiting for us. Right, Percy?

302
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,740
你觉得我们会遇到那些野蛮人吗?
Do you think we'll meet some savages?

303
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,430
如果遇上了 我们肯定会给他们...
If we do, we shall be sure...

304
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,800
一个合适的英国式问候
to give them a proper English greeting.

305
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,740
哦! 礼品篮!
Ooh! gift baskets!

306

哦 不! 他们被抬举得太高了

307
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,910
太完美了 长官
It's perfect, Governor.

308
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,820
水足够深 我们可以直接把船拖到岸边
The water's deep enough. We can pull right up to shore.

309
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,080

我已经把船员集合好了 他们正准备出发
I've got a crew assembled and they're ready to go.

313

至于那些土著...
About the natives...

314
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,130
我希望你确定一下...
I'm counting on you to make sure...

315
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,790
那些肮脏的野蛮人 不要打扰我们的工作
those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission.

316
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,670
如果他们是我曾经 对付过的那种野蛮人
Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before,

317
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,260
没有我不能处理的
it's nothing I can't handle.

318
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,430
- 好 那就行了 Smith - 乖孩子
- Right. That'll be all, Smith. - There's a good man.

319
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,910
再见 Percy
See you, Percy.

320
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,910
那些人喜欢Smith 是不是?
The men like Smith, don't they?

321
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,080
我从来都不是... 一个受欢迎的人
I've never been... a popular man.

322
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,350
我喜欢你
I like you.

323
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,910
不要以为我不知道...
And don't think I don't know...

324
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,250
那些混蛋在宫廷里是怎么说我的
what those back stabbers at court say about me.

325
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,920
哦 是啊 整场对话关于一个
Oh, yes, all that talk about

326
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,950
可怜的想进入上流社会的人 在每一件事上总是失败...
being a pathetic social climber who's failed at everything...

327
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,590
我很清楚地知道这是我 最后一次为荣誉而战的机会
I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory.

328
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,120
你记住今天我所说的 Wiggins.
But mark my words, Wiggins.

329
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,930
当詹姆士国王看到 那些村夫挖来的金子...
When King James sees the gold these peasants unearth...

330
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,230
成功最终会是我的
success will be mine at last.

331
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,770
醒醒! 动起来!
Wake up! Shake a leg!

332
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,670
真是难以置信!
It's incredible!

333
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,410
这些全都是我们的啦
And it's all ours.

334
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,180
我从来没有见过这样的东西
I've never seen anything like it.

335
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,740
就算它看上去像Ratcliffe的灯笼裤我也不管 我现在只想...
It could look like Ratcliffe's knickers, for all I care...

336
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,410
尽快离开这艘发臭的烂船
just as long as I get off this stinkin' boat.

337
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,610
跟上来 伙计们
Come on, men.

338
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,890
我们大老远来不是为了就看看它的
We didn't come all this way just to look at it.

339
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,070
拉紧 伙计们 拉紧 牢牢地! 牢牢地! 抓住! 够远了
Keep it taut, lads. Keep it taut. Steady! Steady! Hold up! That's far enough.

340

好啦... 将她绑好
All right... now. Tie her off.

341
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,210
接着 John 系牢这一端
Here, John, tie off this end.

342
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,750
John啊? John啊?
John? John?

343
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,420
你在那上面干什么呢?
What are you doing up there?

344
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,760
找一个更好的视野
Getting a better look.

345
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,830
你看起来很奇怪
You're a strange-looking fellow.

346
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,360
你饿了吗?
Are you hungry?

347
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
拿去 啊 是饼干

You like it, eh?

00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,640
试着连续吃上四个月
Well, try eating it for four months straight.

351
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,980
那后面有你的朋友?
You got a friend back there?

352
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,800
嗨! 什么...这是什么? 当心
Hey! Wh... What? Watch out.

353
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,360
什么? 不... 别这样... 呃 当心
What? Get... No, get... Uh, look out.

354
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,630
John 你最好还是下来!
John, you better get down here!

355
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,500
长官要上岸了
The governor's coming ashore.

356
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,130
好 好 我这就走了
All right. All right. I'm leaving.

357
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,550
你看到他们的皮肤吗? 他们像狗一样脸上长毛
Did you see their skin? They have hair on their faces like dogs.

358
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
兄弟们 我们必须仔细了解一下这些来客
My brothers, we must know more about these visitors.

359
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,000
Kekata 你看到什么?
Kekata, what do you see?

360
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,610
他们并不是像我们这样的人...
These are not men like us...

361
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,490
而是有着能够像太阳一样发光的躯体的怪物...
but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun...

362
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,590
他们有着能够喷射火和雷的武器
and weapons that spout fire and thunder.

363
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,500
他们巡游着土地 就像贪婪的恶狼...
They prowl the Earth like ravenous wolves...

364
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,010
用他们的方式来毁灭一切
consuming everything in their path.

365
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,950
Great Powhatan 我要带领我们的战士们
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors

366
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,140
去河边去战斗
to the river and attack.

367
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,550
我们要摧毁这些侵略者...
We will destroy these invaders...

368
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,490
就像我们摧毁Masawomecs部落那样
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

369
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,860
Kocoum 在那场战役中 我们知道如何和敌人作战...
Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy...

370
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,550
但是这些白人我们并不了解
But these pale visitors are strange to us.

371
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,090
带一些人去河边监视他们
Take some men to the river to observe them.

372
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,790
希望他们不要准备在这儿逗留
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.

373
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,270
我这里宣布这块土地 还有这里所有的财富...
I hereby claim this land and all its riches...

374
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,240
以最高权威詹姆士国王的名义...

375
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,010
命名为詹姆斯镇

Hurry now, Percy.

378
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,120
我们得为新世界而尽快清洗干净
We must be all squeaky clean for the New World.

379
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,190
Smith船长
Captain Smith,

380
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,000
看来我选择了一个 完美的露营地 恩?
it appears I've selected the perfect location, eh?

381
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,230
没有看到一个野蛮人
Not a savage in sight.

382
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,460
只是我们还没有看到他们...
Just because we don't see them...

383
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,160
并不代表他们不在 长官
doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.

384
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
好 那么也许你应该 向前去观察一下...
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth...

385
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,370
弄清楚他们的行踪 嗯?
and determine their whereabouts, hmm?

386
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,900
如果这儿有印第安人的话 我会发现他们的
If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them.

387
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,440
现在 大家 开始干活
Now, gentlemen, to work.

388
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,280
- 你们这些人 去把船上的东西卸下来 - 是 先生

Why, of course!

394
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,950
不要忘记那些 西班牙人发现了什么...
Let's not forget what the Spanish found...

395
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,790
在他们来到新世界之后
when they came to the New World.

396
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,200
金子! 满山的金子
Gold! Mountains of it.

Why, for years they've been ravaging the New World...

398
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,900
拿走了所有的宝贵资源...
of its most precious resources...

399
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,930

606
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,290
野蛮仅仅是一个词而已 你明白吗?
Savage is just a word, uh, you know?

607
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,070
一个术语... 来形容那些未开化的人
A term... for people who are uncivilized.

608
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,270
就像我
Like me.

609
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,430
恩 我说的未开化...
Well, when I say uncivilized...

610
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,410
是指... 指...
what I mean is... is...

611
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,380
你是指...和你不一样
What you mean is... not like you.

612
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,920
# 你觉得我是一个无知的野蛮人 #
# You think I'm an ignorant savage #

613
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,160
# 你去过那么多地方 #
# And you've been so many places #

614
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,490
# 我想那应该是这样 #
# I guess it must be so #

615
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,260
# 但是仍然 我不明白 #
# But still I cannot see #

616
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,400
# 如果野蛮人都是我 #
# If the savage one is me #

617
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,930
# 怎么还会有那么多的东西 #
# How can there be so much #

618
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,700
# 你不知道? #
# that you don't know? #

619
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:50,450
# 你不知道 #
# You don't know #

620
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,730
# 你认为你所登陆的土地都是你的 #
# You think you own whatever land you land on #

621
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,290
# 大地只是一个没有生命的东西 #
# The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim #

622
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:10,860
# 但是我知道每一块石头 每一棵树木每一个生灵 #
# But I know every rock and tree and creature #

623
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,270
# 都有它的生命 有它的灵魂 #
# Has a life, has a spirit #

624
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,640
# 有它的名字 #
# Has a name #

625
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,080
# 你认为只有像你那样 #
# You think the only people who are people #

626
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:24,310
# 看问题和想问题的人 才是真正的人 #
# Are the people who look and think like you #

627
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,580
# 但是如果你沿着一个陌生人的足迹走下去 #
# But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger #

628
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,650
# 你会学到 #
# You'll learn things #

629
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,420
# 你从来不知道的事情 你从来不知道的事情 #
# you never knew you never knew #

630
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,160
# 你曾经听到过野狼 #
# Have you ever heard the wolf #

631
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,390
# 对着蓝色天空里的明月嚎叫 #
# cry to the blue corn moon #

632
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,490
# 或者问过野猫 为什么它要呲牙咆哮吗? #
# Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?

633
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,330
# 你能和着大山的声音 #
# Can you sing with #

634
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,340
# 一起唱歌吗? #
# all the voices of the mountain? #

# Can you paint with all the colours #

638
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,440
# 来绘画吗? #
# Of the wind? #

639
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,460
# 来沿着寂寞的林间小路 #
# Come run the hidden pine trails #

640
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,620

# Come taste the sun #

642

643
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,730
# 来在你周围 富饶的土地上打滚 #
# Come roll in all the riches all around you #

644
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,230
# 只是 不要去计较是否值得 #
# And for once never wonder what they're worth

645
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,400
# 暴风雨和河流 #
# The rainstorm and the river #

646
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,380

649
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,950
# 我们彼此都息息相关 #
# And we are all connected to each other #

650
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:41,150
# 周而复始永不停息 #
# In a circle In a hoop that never ends #

651
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,290
# 枫树能 #
# How high #

652
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,530
# 长得多么的高? #
# does the sycamore grow? #

653
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,500
# 如果你把它砍了 #

The drums. They mean trouble.

670

我不能再待在这儿了
I shouldn't be here.

小心 滑掉了
Watch it. It's slippery.

677
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,320
加油啊 伙计们 这只是一块篱笆
Come on, lads. It's only a little picket fence.

678
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,660
- 稳住! 稳住! - 这就行了
- Steady! Steady! - There you go.

679
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,260
这会把一切挡在外面 恩 John?
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?

680
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,810
有什么不妥吗 John?
Something wrong, John?

681
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,070
什么?
What?

682
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,600
这几天你都异常地平静
You've been awfully quiet the last few days.

683
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,240
哦 他只是觉得 他错过了所有的行动

684
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,870
啊 不用着急 John
Ah, don't worry, John.

685
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,680
你会有机会去对付 那些印第安人的
You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians.

686
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,280
对 我们会对付他们的...
Yeah, we'll take care of them...

687
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,650
就像上次那样 恩 大伙?
like we did last time, eh, mates?

688
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,160
# 我们会打死一个印第安人 #
# We shot ourselves an Injun #

689
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,990
# 或许两个三个 #
# or maybe two or three #

690
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,620
好了 你个疯子 快去做事!
All right, you howling nutter, get to work!

691
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,130
不要这样 Ben 只是开开玩笑而已
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

692
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,000
哦 当然! 我们有很多乐趣 不是吗?
Oh, sure! We're having loads of fun, right?

693
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,300
看看我们 没有金子 没有食物
Look at us. No gold, no food.

694
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,300
那个Ratcliffe还整天 坐在他的帐篷里...
While Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day...

695
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,830
快活得像个蛤蛎
happy as a clam.

696
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,310
我烦死了!
I am doomed!

697
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,440
现在我已经应该在金子里打滚了...
I should be wallowing in riches by now...

698
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,380
而我却还没有找到一点点金疙瘩!
and I haven't found as much as a speck!

699
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,640
想想 想想!
Think. Think!

700
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,710
应该就在这附近的某个地方
It's got to be around here somewhere.

701
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,190
到底应该在哪儿呢?
Where could it be?

702
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,520
我已经挖掘过森林和山丘
I've mined the forests and the hills

703
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,120
还有沼泽... 什么都没有!
and the swamps... And nothing!

704
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,390
为什么我找不到? 我到底忽略了哪里?
Why can't I find it? What am I overlooking?

705
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,200
我... 我...
I... I...

706
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,230
我自己做的
I made it myself.

707
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,610
那样看起来很傻...
Take that silly...

708
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,870
肯定是的! 那些印第安人
Of course! The Indians.

709
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,780
Wiggins 你觉得为什么...
Wiggins, why do you think...

710
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,370
那些野蛮人要袭击我们?
those insolent heathens attacked us?

711
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,580
因为我们侵入了他们的地盘
Because we invaded their land

712
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,880
砍了他们的树 挖了他们的土地?
and cut down their trees and dug up their earth?

713
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,080
是金子! 他们拥有金子...
It's the gold! They have it...

714
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,320
他们不愿意我们把它带走
and they don't want us to take it from them.

715
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,350
那么 我就只好用武力了 不是吗?
Well, I'll just have to take it by force, then, won't I?

716
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,200
你们这些人! Smith船长去哪儿了?
You there! Where's Captain Smith?

717
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,720
恩 他走了
Well, he's gone.

718
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,860
对 一定是你唱歌把他吓跑了
Aye. Your singing must have scared them off.

719
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,530
那么 看在上帝的份上 把他找来!
Well, then go get him, for heaven's sake!

720
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,400
要是我们遇到印第安人怎么办?
What if we run into the Indians?

721
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,240
那就用枪来对付他们
That's what guns are for.

722
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,570
马上武装起来出发!
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

723
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,970
Pocahontas啊
Pocahontas.

724
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,940
你应该待在部落里
You should be inside the village.

725
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,530
我们会没事的
We'll be all right.

726
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,770
我们正在为战士们准备食物
We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.

727
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:54,970
不要走太远了
Don't go far.

728
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,740
现在不是到处乱跑的时候
Now is not the time to be running off.

729
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,410
是的 父亲
Yes, Father.

730
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,320
当我看到你戴着那串项链...
When I see you wear that necklace...

731
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,050
你就像你母亲一样
you look just like your mother.

732
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,650
我想她
I miss her.

733

但她仍然和我们在一起
But she is still with us.

734
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,560
无论何时风吹过树林...
Whenever the wind moves through the trees...

735
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,330
我就感觉到她的存在
I feel her presence.

736
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,300
我们的人民向她祈祷智慧和力量
Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength.

737
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,070
有一天 他们也会向你祈祷
Someday, they will look to you as well.

738
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,940
我会感到无限荣耀
I would be honoured by that.

739
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,740
你不应该单独待在这儿
You shouldn't be out here alone.

740
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,940
我会叫Kocoum过来的
I'll send for Kocoum.

741
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,470
好了 到底怎么回事?
All right. What is it?

742
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,980
- 什么? - 你隐瞒着什么东西
- What? - You're hiding something.

743
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,950
我没有隐瞒任何东西
I'm not hiding anything.

744
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,150
Pocahontas 你可以告诉我 我发誓
Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise

745
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,180
我不会告诉任何人的... Pocahontas 看!
I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look!

746
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,090
这是他们其中一个! 我要去找...
It's one of them! I'm going to get...

747
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,320
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

748
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,360
我必须要再见你一次
I had to see you again.

749
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,090
Pocahontas啊!

Where is Pocahontas?

755
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,270
我... 我没有看到她
I... I haven't seen her.

756
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,440
Pocahontas不能再到处乱跑了
Pocahontas can't keep running off.

757
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,310
外面很危险
It's dangerous out there.

758
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,750
告诉她这些 她听你的话
Tell her that. She listens to you.

759
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,890
嗨! 她当然听我的
Huh! Sure she does.

760
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,040
这个地方实在太难以置信了
This place is incredible.

761
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,340
想想我们长途跋涉...
And to think we came all this way...

762
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,640
只是为了挖金子
just to dig it up for gold.

763
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,170
金子?
Gold?

764
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:36,880
- 嗨 Meeko - 什么是金子?
- Hey, Meeko. - What's gold?

765
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,980
你也许知道 就是... 黄黄的
You know, it's, uh... it's, it's yellow.

766
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,380
从地里头挖出来的 非常宝贵
It comes out of the ground. It's really valuable.

767
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,360
哦! 这个 我们这儿有很多
Oh! Here, we have lots of it.

768
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,720
金子
Gold.

769
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,560
不 不! 金子是这个
No No! Gold is this.

770
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,220
这附近没有这样的东西
There's nothing like that around here.

771
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,890
- 没有金子? - 至少我没见过
- No gold? - Not that I've seen.

772
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,730
这一趟算是白跑了
All this way for nothing.

773
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,570
那些孩子们将会大吃一惊的
Well, those boys are in for a big surprise.

774
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,010
- 他们会离开吗? - 其中一些可能会
- Will they leave? - Some of them might.

775
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,510
你会回家吗?
Will you go home?

776
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,070
我没什么家可回的
Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.

777
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,520
我从来没有 真正属于过任何地方
I've never really belonged anywhere.

778
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,350
你可以属于这儿
You could belong here.

779
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,430
那是什么?!
What was that?!

780
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,930
你看到什么了吗?
Did you see something?

781
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,870
不 不 我只是...我...
No. No. I just, uh... I...

782
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,170
我没有看到任何东西 是不是?
I didn't see anything, did I?

783
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,700
再看一次
Look again.

784
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,710
# 让它来指引你 #
# Let it break upon you #

785
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:44,380
# 就像波浪打在沙滩上 #
# Like a wave upon the sand #

786
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,390
你好 John Smith
Hello, John Smith.

787
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,320
Pocahontas 那棵树在和我说话
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

788
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,590
那么你就应该回答
Then you should talk back.

789
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,560
不要害怕 年轻人
Don't be frightened, young man.

790
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,500
我的树皮比我咬的更痛
My bark is worse than my bite.

791
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,590
说点什么
Say something.

792
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,620
对一棵树应该说些什么?
What do you say to a tree?

793
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,660
任何你想说的
Anything you want.

794
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,540
那么 恩...
So, uh...

795
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,170
靠近些 John Smith
Come closer, John Smith.

796
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,810
他有一个善良的灵魂
He has a good soul.

797
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,610
他也很帅气!
And he's handsome too!

798
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,050
- 哦 我喜欢她 - 我知道你会的
- Oh, I like her. - I knew you would.

799
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,320
Smith啊!
Smith!

800
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,620
Smith 你在哪儿 伙计?
Smith Where are you, mate?

801
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,850
我们不能让他们看见
We can't let them see us.

802
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,330
快! 到这儿来
Quick! Over here.

803
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,120
这个地方让我害怕
This place gives me the creeps.

804
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,220
野蛮人可能躲在任何地方
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

805
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,200
对 如果你发现一个 不要多想 尽管开枪就是
Aye. Well, if you spot one, don't ask questions. Just shoot.

806
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,370
小心你的脚 你个畸形儿!
Watch your feet, you big oaf!

807
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,200
不是我 是这棵树
It wasn't me. It was the tree.

808
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,400
哦 当然!
Oh, of course!

809
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,880
这棵树好像把它的根抬了一下...
The tree just felt like lifting its roots and...

810
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,650
我们赶快离开这儿
Let's get out of here.

811
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,810
- 啊哦! 快跑啊! - 啊哦!
- Ow! Run! - Ow!

812
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,320
但是Smith怎么办?
But what about Smith?

813
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,190
他已经是个大人了 他能够照顾自己的
He's a big lad. He can take care of himself.

814
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,520
我真高兴你们能站在我这边
I'm glad you're on our side.

815
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,620
这些古老的藤蔓 倒是还有些力气
There's still some snap in these old vines.

816
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,390
我最好在他们把所有人 都派来找我之前赶回去
I'd better get back before they send the whole camp out after me.

817
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,130
我们什么时候能再见面?
When will I see you again?

818
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,430
今天晚上 就在这儿
Meet me tonight. Right here.

819
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,310
嗯 我已经200年 没有碰到这种兴奋的事了
Well, I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.

820
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,470
我到底在做什么? 我不应该再去见他了
What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.

821
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,510
我的意思是 我还想再见到他
I mean, I want to see him again.

822
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,640
谁不想? 我也想再见到他
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

823
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,520
但是仍然 一种内在的感觉...
But still, something inside...

824
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,650
在告诉我 这是对的
is telling me it's the right thing.

825
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,390
或许这就是你的梦
Perhaps it's your dream.

826
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,120
我的梦? 你是说他就是...
My dream? Do you think he's the one...

827
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,530
那个旋转的箭头所指向的?
the spinning arrow was pointing to?

828
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,430
战士们来了!
The warriors are here!

829
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,150
Pocahontas 你疯了吗? 你到底在做什么?
Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with one of them?

830
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,550
- 你在这儿! - Kocoum!
- There you are. - Kocoum!

831
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,750
看看他们! 现在我们有足够的勇士...
Look at them! Now we have enough warriors...

832
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,130
去摧毁那些白皮肤的魔鬼!
to destroy those white demons!

833
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,890
既然我们的兄弟们加入了...
Now that we are joined by our brothers...

834
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,990
我们就要去击败那些敌人
we will defeat this enemy.

835
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,340
父亲 我想和你谈谈
Father, I need to speak with you.

836
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,850
现在不行 我的女儿 首领们正在商量事情
Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering.

837
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,410
我们并不需要和他们打仗 一定有一条更好的路可走
We don't have to fight them! There must be a better way.

838
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,210
有时候我们的路是已经定了的
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

839
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,780
但是也许我们 可以试着和他们谈谈
But maybe we should try talking to them.

840
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,480
他们并不想谈判
They do not want to talk.

841
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,550
但是如果他们 其中一个真的想要呢...
But if one of them did want to talk...

842
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,320
你会听他的 是吗?
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

843
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,420
- Pocahontas - 是吗?
- Pocahontas. - Wouldn't you?

844
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,760
我当然会 但是事情并不是那么简单
Of course I would. But it is not that simple.

845
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,200
没有什么事情会这么简单的
Nothing is simple any more.

846
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,450
别紧张 Thomas 是我
Easy, Thomas. It's me.

847
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,280
哦 John 我差点打中你
Oh, John. I could've killed you.

848
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,220
你这样瞄准是打不中我的
Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

849
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,980
当你射击的时候 两只眼睛都睁着
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.

850
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,920
你会瞄得准得多
You'll see twice as well.

851
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,430
Smith 你回来了!
Smith, there you are!

852
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,220
我们正四处找你
We were looking all over for you.

853
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,490
Smith! 你刚刚去哪儿了?
Smith! Where have you been?

854
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,300
我去观察地形了 长官
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

855
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,700
聪明 那么你一定 知道印第安人的行踪了
Excellent. Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts.

856
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,330
这些信息对我们的 战役应该会有帮助的
We'll need that information for the battle.

857
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,570
什么战役?
What battle?

858
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,580
我们要把这些 野蛮人一次消灭干净
We will eliminate these savages once and for all.

859
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,080
不! 你不能那么做!
No! You can't do that!

860
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,980
哦 不能?
Oh, can't I?

861
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,510
听着 我们并不需要和他们打仗
Look, we don't have to fight them.

862
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,820
- John 你怎么了? - 我见过他们当中一个
- John, what's gotten into you? - I met one of them.

863
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,340
- 你什么?! - 一个野蛮人?
- You what?! - A savage?

864
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,050
他们不是野蛮人 他们能够帮助我们
They're not savages. They can help us.

865
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,250
他们了解这片土地
They know the land.

866
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,560
他们知道怎样在河里航行
They know how to navigate the rivers.

867
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,360
- 再看 这是食物 - 这是什么?
- And look. It's food. - What is it?

868
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,960
这个肯定比硬面饼和稀粥强
It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.

869
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,190
我喜欢稀粥
I like gruel.

870
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,640
他们不会给我们食物 你们这些笨蛋!
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

871
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,470
他们想要杀死我们! 我们所有的人!
They want to kill us! All of us!

872
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,740
他们拿走了我们的金子...
They've got our gold...

873
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,500
为了留住它 他们会做出任何事情!
and they'll do anything to keep it!

874
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,030
但是这儿没有金子
But there is no gold.

875
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,050
没有金子?
No gold?

876
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,410
我猜肯定是你的印第安小朋友告诉你的?
And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this?

877
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,920
没错
Yes.

878
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,550
谎言! 谎言! 一切都是谎言! 危险的小偷!
Lies! Lies! All of it! Murderous thieves!

879
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,820
在文明世界中他们没有立足之地
There's no room for their kind in civilized society.

880
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,290
但是这儿是他们的地盘!
But this is their land!

881
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,730
这是我的地盘! 我在这儿制定法律
This is my land! I make the laws here.

882
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,060
我说过任何人一旦发现了印第安人...
And I say anyone who so much as looks at an Indian...

883
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,660
而没有将他当场杀死的...
without killing him on sight...

884
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,900
将被判为叛国罪而处以绞刑!
will be tried for treason and hanged!

885
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,890
Pocahontas啊!
Pocahontas!

886
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,860
- Nakoma! - 不要出去
- Nakoma! - Don't go out there.

887
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,220
我为你撒过一次谎 不要让我再做一次
I lied for you once. Don't ask me to do it again.

888
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,730
我必须要这样做
I have to do this.

889
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,960
- 他是他们其中之一! - 你不了解他
- He's one of them! - You don't know him.

890
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,160
如果你去了那儿...
If you go out there...

891
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,030
你就背叛了你自己的族人
You'll be turning your back on your own people.

892
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,470
我在努力拯救我的族人
I'm trying to help my people.

893
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,030
Pocahontas 求你 你是我最好的朋友
Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend.

894
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,600
我不想看到你受到伤害
I don't want you to get hurt.

895
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,610
我不会的 我知道我自己在做什么
I won't. I know what I'm doing.

896
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,200
Pocahontas 不!
Pocahontas, no!

897
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,080
Ratcliffe不会让我们...
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us...

898
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,850
在这个世界什么都找不到
halfway around the world for nothin'.

899
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,650
但是如果Smith说得是真的呢?
But what if Smith is right?

900
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,590
如果真的没有金子该怎么办?
What if there is no gold?

901
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,890
如果你问我...
If you ask me...

902
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,790
Ratcliffe从我们离开伦敦的时候就在骗我们
Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London.

903
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,760
听着 你们这些白痴
Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.

904
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,130
那些野蛮人不会吃了没事和我们打战的
Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'.

905
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,030
他们一定在隐藏着什么东西
They're hidin' somethin'.

906
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,700
如果他们真的有金子...
If they do have the gold...

907
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,530
我想我们会和他们打战的
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.

908
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,200
要不太冷要不太热
Either too hot or too cool.

909
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,510
我从一到这儿就没舒服过
I haven't been comfortable since we got here.

910
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:13,350
哦 我也是 我痒得难受
Oh, I know. I've been itching a lot.

911
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,010
- 跟着他 - 是的 长官
- Follow him. - Yes, Governor.

912
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,990
我想知道他偷偷地跑去哪儿
I want to know where he's sneaking off to.

913
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,190
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

914
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,460
如果你遇到什么印第安人
And if you happen to see any Indians,

915
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,090
开枪打死他
Shoot them.

916
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,600
哦 Thomas 你已经是一个差劲的水手
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor

917
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,270
又是一个可怜的士兵
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

918
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,470
不要让我再次失望
Don't disappoint me again.

919
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,650
- Kocoum - 什么事?
- Kocoum. - What is it?

920
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,780
是关于Pocahontas的
It's Pocahontas.

921
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,550
怎么了? 她还好吗?
What's wrong? Is she all right?

922
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,590
我想她有麻烦了
I think she's in trouble.

923
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,130
大地在颤抖 孩子 发生什么事了?
The Earth is trembling, child. What's happened?

924
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,610
战士们在这儿!
The warriors are here!

925
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,770
- Pocahontas啊! - John啊!
- Pocahontas! - John!

926
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,240
听我说
Listen to me.

927
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,640
我们的人正在计划攻击你的族人
My men are planning to attack your people.

928
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,840
你得去通知他们
You've got to warn them.

929
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,350
也许现在阻止这些还不算太晚
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

930
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,320
你得跟我一起回去 去和我父亲谈判
You have to come with me and talk to my father.

931
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,080
Pocahontas 谈判已经没有用了
Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good.

932
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,920
我已经努力地去和我们的人谈了...
I already tried talking to my men...

933
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,050
但是这片土地上的任何一件事情都让他们感到恐惧
but everything about this land has them spooked.

934
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,200
那是我见过的最奇怪的生物!
That's the strangest creature I've ever seen.

935
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,860
Percy啊?!
Percy?!

936
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,810
放松点 Percy! 到这儿来!
Easy, Percy! Come here!

937
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,040
Meeko 回来!
Meeko, come back!

938
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,540
你看这就是我的意思?
You see what I mean?

939
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,880
一旦双方准备开仗 谁也挡不住
Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.

940
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,310
过来 你们俩都给我过来!
Come Come here, both of you!

941
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,210
好了! 好了! 他是一个朋友!
It's all right! It's all right! He's a friend!

942
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,550
坏! 坏狗! 坐下!
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

943
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,650
- 你在干什么? Meeko! - Pency 回到这里来!
- What are you doing? Meeko! - Percy, get back here!

944
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,990
你在干什么? 停下来!
What are you doing? Stop that!

945
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,520
好了 够了!
All right, that's enough!

946
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,830
足够让你的体液沸腾
It's enough to make your sap boil.

947
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,970
现在 我有东西给你们看 看!
Now then, there's something I want to show you. Look.

948
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,970
波纹
The ripples.

949
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,210
他们什么意思?
What about them?

950
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,340
一开始很小
So small at first,

951
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:34,050
然后看他们扩散得多大
then look how they grow.

952
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,820
但是总得有人去开始
But someone has to start them.

953
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,330
他们不会听我们的
They're not going to listen to us.

954
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,660
年轻人 有时候正确的路
Young man, sometimes the right path

955
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,490
往往不是最简单的那条
is not the easiest one.

956
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,530
难道你不明白? 只有当战争停止了...
Don't you see? Only when the fighting stops...

957
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,560
你们才能在一起
can you be together.

958
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,430
好吧 我们去和你父亲谈谈
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

959
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,910
Kocoum! 不!
Kocoum! No!

960
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,980
Kocoum啊!
Kocoum!

961
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,960
放开他!
Leave him alone!

962
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,940
Kocoum! 停下来!
Kocoum! Stop!

963
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,280
双眼睁开
Both eyes open.

964
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,460
- Thomas! - 他...
- Thomas! - Is he...

965
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,360
你杀了他
You killed him.

966
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,370
- 我以为... - 离他远些!
- I thought that... - Get away from him!

967
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,490
Pocahontas 这样没有用的! 他只是...
Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only...

968
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,800
他杀了他!
He killed him!

969
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,640
Thomas 离开这儿!
Thomas, get out of here!

970
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,010
离开这儿!
Get out of here!

971
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,010
谁干的?
Who did this?

972
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,140
Pocahontas在野外树林里
Pocahontas was out in the woods.

973
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:47,840
Kocoum去找他 这个白人袭击了他
Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked him.

974
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,280
你们的武器很厉害
Your weapons are strong,

975
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,050
但是现在我的怒火更厉害
but now our anger is stronger.

976
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,890
在太阳升起的时候 首先就将他处死!
At sunrise he will be the first to die!

977
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,080
但是 父亲...
But, Father...

978
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:00,120
我告诉过你待在部落里
I told you to stay in the village.

979
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,100
你违背了我
You disobeyed me.

980
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,120
你让你的父亲蒙羞!
You have shamed your father!

981
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,960
我只是想做点帮助
I was only trying to help.

982
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,060
就因为你的愚蠢 Kocoum死掉了!
Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead!

983
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,370
把他带走!
Take him away!

984
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,950
Kocoum只是想来保护我
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

985
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,820
Pocahontas啊...
Pocahontas...

986
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,830
是我让Kocoum跟着你的
I sent Kocoum after you.

987
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,890
我很担心你
I was worried about you.

988
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:39,130
我原以为我做了件正确的事
I-I thought I was doing the right thing.

989
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,600
所有这些都是因我而起
All this happened because of me.

990
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,170
现在我再也见不到John Smith了
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

991
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,010
跟我来
Come with me.

992
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,740
Pocahontas想最后看一眼...
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes...

993
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,840
那个杀了Kocoum的人
of the man who killed Kocoum.

994
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,150
最好快点
Be quick.

995
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,340
Pocahontas啊
Pocahontas.

01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,770
我真是抱歉
I'm so sorry.

997
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,280
为了什么? 这件事吗?
For what? This?

998
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,650
比这还糟糕的困境 我都摆脱出来了
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.

999
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,620
现在想不起来了 但是...
Can't think of any right now, but...

1000
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,490
如果我们不曾见过 事情也许不会这么糟糕
It would've been better if we'd never met.

1001
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,290
这些事情都不会发生
None of this would've happened.

1002
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,720
Pocahontas 看着我
Pocahontas, look at me.

1003
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,160
我情愿明天就去死...
I'd rather die tomorrow...

1004
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,500
也不要长寿 但不认识你
than live a hundred years without knowing you.

1005
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,170
Pocahontas啊
Pocahontas.

1006
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,170
- 我不能离开你 - 你不会离开我的

不管我发生什么事 我会跟你在一起的 永远
No matter what happens to me, I'll always be with you. Forever.

救命! 快救命啊! 救命! 救命!
Help! Somebody help! Help! Help!

1009

- 别急 伙计 怎么了? - Smith! 他们抓住他了!
- Easy, lad. What is it? - It's Smith! They got him!

1010
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,430
- 谁抓住他了? - 野蛮人!

- 有多少人? - 我不知道 至少有十来个
- How many were there? - I don't know. At least a dozen.

1014
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,430
- 可恶的畜生! - Ratcliffe是对的!
- Filthy beasts! - Ratcliffe was right!

1015
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,230
太好了 Wiggins 我自己可不能计划的这么好
It's perfect, Wiggins. I couldn't have planned this better myself.

1016
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,370
金子肯定是我的了
The gold is as good as mine.

1017
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,230
我们得救他! 换了我们任何谁 他也会这么做的!
We've got to save him! He'd do the same for any of us!

- Thomas是对的! 我们得做点什么! - 我们应该做点什么
- Thomas is right! We've got to do somethin'! - And so we shall.

1019
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:42,500
- 我跟你说过不能信这些野蛮人 - 对!
- I told you those savages couldn't be trusted. - That's right!

1020
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,830
Smith想跟他们成为朋友 看看他们对他做了什么!
Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they've done to him!

1021
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:49,970

- Yeah, that's right. - But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade.

1022
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:53,630
天一亮 我们就进攻!
At daybreak, we attack!

1023
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,030
对这些无赖我们还能期待什么呢
What can you expect from filthy little heathens

1024
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,230
- 当有不同种族的时候就会发生这种事 - 没错
- Here's what you get when races are diverse - That's right.

# 他们不像你和我 他们是恶魔 #
# They're not like you and me which means they must be evil #

1030
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,630
# 我们要敲响战鼓 #

# 在那乳白色的皮肤之下 里面全都是空的 #

他总是把自己想得太高了
And he came so highly recommended.

船已经准备好了 我们最好把你抬到甲板上 我们会错过潮汐的
The ship's almost ready. We'd better get you on board. We'll lose the tide.
