1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,170
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime...

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,500
飞船迫降 看来已经坠毁几百年了
A crash landing, buried here for centuries.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,270
这些汽车人并不是死于飞船失事
These Autobots didn't perish in the crash.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,300
他们的症状…像是感染了病毒
They are displaying the effects of a virus.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,820
如果真的有解药 威震天可能是唯一知道底细的人
If a cure exists, Megatron maybe the only one who knows it.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,810
你们必须进入他的大脑 找到解药！
You must enter his brain and find it.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,930
你在我的脑子里干什么？
What are you doing inside my head?

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,700
配方已经到手 断开大黄蜂的驳接 快！
We have the formula, disconnect Bumblebee, now!

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,370
不！带我一起走！
No, take me!

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,840
我出来了
I'm out! Hahahahahaha...

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,870
眼睛看着光 好 好
Follow the light. Good, good.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,910
我建议你不要做剧烈运动 擎天柱
I wouldn't advice anything strenuous, Optimus

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,330
尽管目前看来 你的系统已经从灰死病的侵蚀中完全恢复了
but it appears that your systems have fully recovered from the Cybonic plague.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,920
幸好有你高明的医术 老朋友
Thanks to your medical expertise, old friend.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,790
幸好有你的侦察兵 单枪匹马 深入虎穴找到解药
It was your scout who braved unknown territory to locate the cure.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,020
幸好威震天还活着
Lucky for us Megatron was still alive.

17
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,680
没错 的确很走运
Yea, I actually said that.

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,790
重要的是 你的病情有所好转 擎天柱
What matters is that you are on the mend, Optimus

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,010
威震天现在…
while Megatron...

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,900
小蜂说得对 我很想手刃威震天
Bee's right, 'did my best to finish Megatron's story.

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,580
可当时来不及看他咽下最后一口气
Just couldn't stick around long enough to see how it ended.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,710
擎天柱早晚会发现你心怀鬼胎 侦察兵
It is a matter of time before Optimus discovers all is not right with you, scout.

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,720
我必须取回我的身体
I must reclaim my body

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,900
也就是说 眼下我要完完全全地控制你的身体！
which means taking complete and total control of yours.

25
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,300
塞博特恩式篮球比赛
Basketball by way of Cybertron.

26
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,030
比赛正式开始！
Let the games begin!

27
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,170
漂亮！小隔加油！
Yeah, go Bulk!

28
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,270
来吧 我们三局两胜！
Come on, best two out of three.

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,450
小蜂 现在后防空虚！
Bee, you are in the clear!

30
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,580
扣篮啊 小蜂！
Dunk it, Bee!

31
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,500
大黄蜂 小心持球违例！
Bumblebee, quit hugging the ball!

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,210
恶意犯规！
Ngrr, flagrant foul!

33
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,280
更像是塞博特恩躲避球比赛
Dodge Ball by way of Cybertron.

34
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,710
小蜂 篮筐在那边
Bee, hoop's over there.

35
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,760
小蜂 你没事吧？
Bee, you OK?

36
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,770
好吧 那就五局三胜
Yea, three out of five.

37
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,070
如果我想回到自己的身体里去
If I am to return my body

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,580
必须先恢复身体的各项功能
I must first restore its functionality.

39
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,480
我当初是如何逃过一劫的？
How did I escape annihilation?

40
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,300
对了 是黑暗能量！
Of course, Dark Energon!

41
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,320
红蜘蛛！
Starscream!

42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,210
当当当 有人在里面吗？
Knock, knock. Is anyone in there?

43
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,840
没有？那好吧…
No. Oh well...

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,230
看来我拥有唯一一个
Seems I possess the only thing

45
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,920
能让你从病榻上重新站起来的东西
that would allow you to rise off that slab and walk again.

46
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,160
最最亲爱的威震天…
My dearest Megatron...

47
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,480
这星球上仅存的碎片
The only scrap left on this planet

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,260
正是从你的火种室里拔出来的
plucked from your very spark chamber.

49
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,770
但它并不能恢复你的意识
But it cannot restore your mind.

50
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,970
霸天虎需要的是首领
The Decepticons need a leader

51
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,890
不是高高在上的废铁
not a decorative centerpiece.

52
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,860
我会向他们证明 只有我才配继承你的王位
And I will convince them that I am the true heir to your throne

53
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,450
我要勾画一副宏伟蓝图…
with a plan so epic...

54
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,200
连强大的威震天 也构思不出的那种蓝图？
Not even the mighty Megatron could've conceived it?

55
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,400
呃 我就是这么想的 击倒
Eh, that was the idea, Knock Out.

56
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,520
你过来多久了？
How long have you been there?

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,270
很久了
Long enough.

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,480
请叫我击倒指挥官
And it's Commander Knock Out to you

59
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,140
永恒的王者 红蜘蛛陛下
once and future Lord Starscream.

60
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,640
拉夫？已经上课了
Raf? Class is starting.

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,590
大黄蜂没来送我上学
Bumblebee never picked me up for school

62
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,260
他的通讯链也关了
and his comlink is off again.

63
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,690
你知道他在哪里么？
Any idea where he is?

64
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,700
对 继续 侦察兵 服从我的意志！
Yes, go on scout, obey my will!

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,940
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

66
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,630
那东西我还有用呐！
I needed that!

67
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,930
你脑子里究竟在想什么？
What has got into you?

68
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,970
你看见威震天了？
You are seeing Megatron's face?

69
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,410
大黄蜂说 他总能看见断断续续的影像
Bumblebee's complaining of intermittent visions.

70
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,590
可以说是种梦魇
Waking nightmares, if you will.

71
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,110
但你给小蜂做全面检查时 说他很健康
But, you said Bee was fine when you checked him over.

72
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,130
身体很健康
Physically

73
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,340
但一些不堪回首的经历 似乎对他的心理造成了暂时影响
but the experience he endured seems to be having a temporary effect on his psychy.

74
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,660
这次诱导性休眠 可以强行停止并恢复大黄蜂的意识
This induced power down should force Bumblebee's mind to rest and recover.

75
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,850
擎天柱 你最近发现穿草裙的霸天虎了吗？
Prime, you spot any Decepticons wearing hula skirt lately?

76
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,840
没发现 福勒探员 又怎么了？
No, Special Agent Fowler. Why?

77
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,150
我以为你有虎子的线索呢
Coz I was hoping you have a lead on the Cons

78
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,770
他们破坏了夏威夷考艾岛的海军气象台
that busted into the Kauai Naval Observatory.

79
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,630
那里看起来像是被军队强拆了一样
Place look like it was hit by an army of wrecking balls.

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,350
霸天虎干嘛要进攻一个气象台？
Why would Cons break into an Observatory?

81
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,400
“霍伊克・尼哥高西安”这个名字耳熟么？
Does the Heuck Nigoghossian ring any bells?

82
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,770
是那个太空望远镜！
The space telescope!

83
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,660
昨晚 它的主镜头被盗了
As of last night missing its primary lens.

84
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,500
很难猜测红蜘蛛有什么意图
It's difficult to guess Starscream's intent

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,180
我们并不知道镜头的下落
without knowing where the lens has been taken.

86
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,850
好在那个镜头有跟踪装置
Good thing's the lens has a tracking device.

87
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,420
北极？太好了！
The Arctic? Great!

88
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,910
又可以体验火种被冻僵的感觉了
Another chance to freeze our sparkplugs off.

89
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,430
是ND-7级别的区域 那儿的能量矿面积最大 但无法开采
Hew... That's a ND-7 class, biggest unminable energon deposit there is.

90
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,170
除非红蜘蛛能想办法让冰面融化
Unminable until Starscream melt his way down to it.

91
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,090
那个镜头可以派上用场
With the help of the lens.

92
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,700
融化那片大冰川 会使海平面上升 淹没沿海城市
Melting a glacier that size would cause sea levels to rise and demolish coastal cities.

93
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,100
让红蜘蛛陛下赐予的甘露…降临吧
Let the rain of Lord Starscream... begin.

94
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,750
我风驰电掣般冲过终点线
So I blow pass the finish line.

95
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,930
然后另一个姐姐问我 为何这么擅长赛车
Then my other sister Plaura asked how I got so good at racing games.

96
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,200
我就说 我认识一个非常懂车的家伙
And I told her I know a guy who knows cars.

97
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,350
拉斐尔 恐怕大黄蜂听不见你说话 他正处于休眠模式
Raphael, I'm afraid Bumblebee can't hear you in power-down mode.

98
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,480
太晚了 要不然 我先送你回家吧？
It's getting late. Why don't I bridge you home to your family?

99
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,550
我跟小蜂说过 我要留下 他也是我的家人
Because I told Bee I'd stay. He's family, too.

100
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,920
别扯了 你们根本不是同一个物种
Don't be ridiculous. You are not even the same species.

101
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,960
那叫“亲戚”
That's being related.

102
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,120
“亲戚”跟“家人”是两回事 我拿给你看
It's not the same thing. I'll show you.

103
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,840
这是我的全家福照片
This is my family.

104
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,250
嗯 嗯 是的 很好
Hm, hm. Yes, very nice.

105
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,130
是个大家庭
Very large.

106
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,300
有时即使我大喊大叫 也没人理我
Sometimes I can shout and no one hears me.

107
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,950
是是是…
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

108
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,780
但是大黄蜂总会听我说话
But Bumblebee always listens.

109
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,610
我也能理解他的滴滴声
And I can understand him.

110
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,660
不知为什么 我全能听懂
I'm not sure why, but I do.

111
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,960
和上次的极地旅行相比 变化很大
A lot different than our last polar visit.

112
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,060
感觉像是夏天
Feels like summer.

113
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,860
看 问题出在那儿
Here, that's a bad thing.

114
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,300
汽车人 还记得在乱魔城的那次迂回进攻吗？
Autobots, remember the end run on Polyhex?

115
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,300
（Polyhex 乱魔城 塞博特恩环轨行省之一 曾是卫星和网络指挥中心 内战中被霸天虎攻占 建有众多熔炼池和角斗场）
Autobots, remember the end run on Polyhex?

116
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,440
拉斐尔 我要去仓库找些零件来修理这个
Raphael, I'm going to the supply vol to see if I can find parts to repair this.

117
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,240
你应该明白我的意思吧？
You know what that means?

118
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,460
（Polyhex 乱魔城 塞博特恩环轨行省之一 曾是卫星和网络指挥中心 内战中被霸天虎攻占 建有众多熔炼池和角斗场）
"Don't touch anything."

119
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,460
“什么都别碰”
"Don't touch anything."

120
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,140
先看看这台新手提电脑 我存钱要买的 小蜂
Wait til I see this new laptop I'm saving up for, Bee.

121
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,220
小蜂？
Bee?

122
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,150
大黄蜂 等等！
Bumblebee, wait!

123
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,190
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

124
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,640
你碰什么了？
What did you do?

125
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,150
什么也没碰 大黄蜂是自己站起来的…
Nothing, Bumblebee just got up and...

126
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,040
他明明处于休眠模式！
He was in power-down.

127
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,260
他这是要去哪儿？
Where does he think he's off to?

128
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,480
它在哪儿？在哪儿？
Where is it? Where?

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,300
这些坐标指向我们上次 遭遇威震天不死大军的地方
These are the coordinates for the site of our previous battle with Megatron's undead.

130
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,450
我们是不是该通知擎天柱？
Maybe we should call Optimus?

131
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,790
擎天柱正忙着解决极地冰盖融化的事
Optimus is busy preventing a polar ice cap from melting.

132
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,250
我们得自己处理了
We need to handle this on our own.

133
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,880
大黄蜂？你干什么去了？
Bumblebee? What have you been doing?

134
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,080
黑暗能量？
Dark Energon?

135
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,930
小蜂 你在干什么！
Bee, what are you doing?

136
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,030
大黄蜂 拜托！我知道你的意识还在！
Bumblebee, please! I know you are in there!

137
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,920
你必须和控制你意识的东西做斗争！
You have to fight whatever is making you do this!

138
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,470
救护车 你没事吧？
Ratchet, are you OK?

139
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,860
我没事 问题在于 大黄蜂怎么了？
I'm fine. More importantly, is bumblebee?

140
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,340
我担心他在威震天的意识里逗留太久
I fear the time spent in Megatron's mindscape

141
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,050
导致他的思维越来越像霸天虎
is causing him to think like a Decepticon.

142
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,520
小蜂才不是虎子呢！
Bee's not a Con!

143
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,820
我同意 但我们必须弄清楚
Agreed, but we need to find out exactly

144
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,330
大黄蜂拿着那个碎片要做什么
what Bumblebee intends to do with that shard.

145
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,910
唯一一个了解黑暗能量的人
The only one who knew of the Dark Energon

146
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,680
就是威震天
was Megatron.

147
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,610
大黄蜂拥有威震天的记忆？
Bumblebee has Megatron's memories?

148
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,710
可能更糟 威震天在控制大黄蜂的思想
Worse, Megatron is occupying Bumblebee's mind.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,790
什么？
What?

150
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,700
我怎么那么蠢！
How could I've been such a fool!

151
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,260
大脑皮层通灵驳接是个交互式的过程
The cortical psychic patch acted as a two-way condulet.

152
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,640
当大黄蜂的意识回归身体时
When Bumblebee returned to his own mind

153
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,310
威震天也紧跟其后
Megatron followed.

154
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,430
而现在大黄蜂――
And now Bumblebee--

155
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,560
应该说威震天 已经把自己传送到擎天柱的位置附近
Megatron has bridged to nearly the same coordinates Optimus used.

156
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,650
你留在这里
Stay here.

157
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,700
不 大黄蜂需要我！
No. Bumblebee needs me!

158
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,160
他的确需要你
Of course he does.

159
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,850
是的！计划终于按部就班地实施了！
Yes! I love when a plan comes together!

160
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,150
汽车人！
Autobots!

161
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,550
劳驾 红蜘蛛陛下 请给你的副官一次立功的机会
Please, Lord Starscream. Allow your second-in-command the honor.

162
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,590
打击 消灭他们！
Breakdown, total them!

163
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,020
霸天虎的战舰！
The Decepticon warship!

164
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,110
这是大黄蜂干的吗？
Did Bumblebee do this?

165
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,960
恐怕威震天的意识占了上风
I fear Megatron's mind is dominant.

166
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,140
而且很明显 他来这里只有一个目的――
And clearly he came here for one purpose--

167
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,470
用黑暗能量来修复自己的身体
to use the Dark Energon to resurrect his own body.

168
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,760
不 大黄蜂不会让他得逞的！
No. Bumblebee won't let him.

169
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,150
刚才在基地 他就没让威震天伤害我
Like he didn't let Megatron hurt me back at base.

170
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,650
希望你是对的
I hope you're right.

171
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,810
救护车 别伤害大黄蜂！
Ratchet, don't hurt Bumblebee!

172
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,760
那不是大黄蜂！
That's not Bumblebee!

173
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,400
大黄蜂 住手！
Bumblebee, no!

174
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,370
想想你是谁 想想我！
Remember who you are, remember me!

175
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,700
我知道无论如何 你都会听我说话的！
I know you'll always listen to me, no matter what!

176
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,270
没错 小蜂 是我啊！
That's right, Bee. It's me!

177
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,820
怎么会这样！
Unbelievable!

178
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,760
永别了 威震天！
Farewell, Megatron!

179
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,160
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

180
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,510
大黄蜂再也听不到你说话了！
Bumblebee can't hear you anymore!

181
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,410
虽然我很想让你离开大黄蜂的身体
As mush as I want you to leave Bumblebee's body

182
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,710
可我决不让你回到自己的躯壳！
I can't let you go back to your own!

183
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,700
霸天虎们 你们至高无上的主人已经回来了！
Decepticons, your rightful lord and master has returned!

184
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,170
把这些虫子消灭掉！
Finish these pests!

185
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,860
有个死刑 我要去亲手执行
I have my own extermination to perform.

186
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,450
把你冻成冰块怎么样？
How about I put you on ice?

187
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,670
汽车人是不是…缺乏人手？
Don't the Bots seem... understaff?

188
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,500
一个顾前不顾后的副官 我要他何用！
Uhhh... What good is a second-in-command who fails to watch the rear!

189
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,340
给我滚开！
Get out of my way!

190
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,850
不！！
No!!

191
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,740
擎天柱！
Optimus!

192
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,900
威震天犯下的最大的错误
Megatron's greatest mistake

193
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,560
就是放你一条生路 擎天柱！
was ever allowing you to live, Prime!

194
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,250
威震天…
Megatron...

195
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,800
他回来了
He's back.

196
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:55,740
威震天…陛下 您…这…您痊愈了！
Lord... Megatron, you... are... you are healed!

197
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,550
感谢火种源 奇迹发生了！
Praise the Allspark, it is a miracle!

198
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,230
喔 奇迹会发生的 红蜘蛛
Oh, it will be a miracle, alright, Starscream.

199
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,800
这要看你能不能逃过我的惩罚！
if you survive what I have planned for you!

200
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,750
可那些汽车人…还有擎天柱！您看 就在您脚下！
But the Autobots! Optimus! Right there, waiting for you!

201
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,300
我犯下了大错吗？其实有很多
My greatest mistake? I've made a few.

202
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,050
但有一种错误 我绝不会再犯！
But there is one I do not intend to make again!

203
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,800
不 主人 不！！！
No, master, nooooo...

204
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,400
救护车 我们需要传送
Ratchet, we need a bridge.

205
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,600
需要传送的不只是你们
You are not the only ones.

206
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,150
一切回归正常
Everything's back to normal.

207
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,650
至少大黄蜂复原了
Well, normal for Bumblebee.

208
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,250
没关系
It's OK.

209
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,450
我当然很勇敢
Of course I was.

210
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,300
我理解
I know.

211
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,650
他说什么？
What did he say?

212
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,600
他说谢谢
He said thanks.
