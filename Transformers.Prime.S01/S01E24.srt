1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,500
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime:

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,160
预言中提到的星球串联现象
The planetary alignment

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,690
近在眼前
is nearly upon us.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,530
我见过这座喷火的高山！
The flaming mountain in my visions...

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,750
从这个地方
A place from whence

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,910
我可以尽情地收集黑暗能量！
I am to harvest Dark Energon!

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,000
把他推过来 快！
I need him over here, now!

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:32,650
威震天 今天你必须服法 向塞博特恩和人类低头认罪
Megatron, today you answer for your crimes against Cybertron and humanity.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,890
脉搏稳定下来了
Pulse rate is stabilizing.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,320
看来我苦苦寻找的宇宙大帝之血
It seems the blood of Unicron I've been seeking

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,160
不是在星云之间 而是就在…我的脚下！
is not out there, but rather, right here!

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,960
为什么宇宙大帝之血 会从地底喷发出来？
Why is the blood of Unicron erupting from beneath the Earth?

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,610
这个问题嘛 擎天柱
A question, Optimus

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,550
你到坟墓里去思考吧！
that you shall take to your grave.

15
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,450
快！必须把他带回去
Quickly! We must pull him trough.

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,980
小隔 快 快 快走！！
Bulk, now, now, now!

17
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,890
好戏才刚刚开始！
This is merely the beginning!

18
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,500
现在我拥有的黑暗能量 足以唤醒宇宙大帝！
I now possess enough Dark Energon to reanimate Unicron himself!

19
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,690
哈哈哈…是的！哈哈哈…
Hahaha... yes! Hahaha...

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,650
放松 擎天柱
Easy, Optimus.

21
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,990
从症状看来 你感染了相当多的黑暗能量
From the looks of things, you've been exposed to a mass of amount of Dark Energon.

22
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,590
有人跟我同病相怜
I am not the only one.

23
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,110
嘿
Hey.

24
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,630
能活下来 是他命大
He's lucky to be alive.

25
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,430
威震天又找到黑煤球了？
Megatron found more of the dark stuff?

26
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
整整一火山的
A Volcano full.

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,700
问题是 他怎么找的？
The question is, how?

28
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,720
不 问题是 他想干嘛
No, the question is, what

29
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,310
传说中的宇宙大帝之血 为什么会出现在地球上
as in what in the world is the blood of Unicron doing here on Earth.

30
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,240
虎子们杀了只独角兽？
The 'Cons killed a Unicorn?

31
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,800
和白马一样 不过头上长角…
White horse with a horn on its head...

32
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,930
活蹦乱跳撒欢儿那种？
prances around all sparkly?

33
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,090
是“宇宙大帝” 远古的恶魔
Unicron, an ancient evil

34
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,000
他的血液在石化之后 形成了我们所说的那种黑暗能量…
whose fossilized blood comprises the matter which we call Dark Energon...

35
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,220
反正…传说里是这么讲的
... as legend would have it.

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,520
你是说 这个宇宙大帝是某种妖怪？
So you're saying, this Unicron is some kind of bogeyman?

37
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,890
妖怪？
Bogeyman?

38
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,510
大人捏造的 藏在衣柜里的怪物
Make believe creepy guy who hides in your closet.

39
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,970
不 达比护士
No, Nurse Darby.

40
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,030
宇宙大帝确实存在…过…
Unicron is very real... was.

41
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,840
就是说 虽然我相信他曾经存在
That is, while I do believe he once exited

42
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
可我不认同那种说法 据说…
I just don't subscribe to the theory that his...

43
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,390
构成他原始生命力的物质就是…拉夫感染的东西
primordial life force is the substance which... harmed Raf.

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
我听够了
I've heard it enough

45
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,580
杰克 过来 帮我把拉夫抱上车
Jack, please, help me get Raf into the car.

46
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,310
妈妈 他不是好多了吗
Mom, I thought he was doing better.

47
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,270
拉夫需要接受真人医生的检查
Raf needs to be examined by really doctors

48
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,370
拉夫的家人也要了解情况
and Raf's family needs to know what's happened.

49
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,810
他真正的家人
His real family.

50
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,130
妈妈 拉夫的家人没法保护他
Mom, Raf's family can't protect him.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,080
不会像他们这样
Not like they can.

52
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,000
琼 我为自己的失败感到十分懊悔
June, it deeply grieves me that I have failed.

53
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
但我会尽我的一切所能来确保…
But I will do everything in my power to ensure

54
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,440
再也不会有人伤及我们的人类朋友 以及其他任何人类
that no harm comes to our human friends or any human ever again.

55
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,490
擎天柱 他们还是孩子
Optimus, they are children.

56
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
他们不属于你那个世界
They do not belong in your world.

57
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,120
他们应该关心自己的成绩 舞伴 青春痘…
They should be worrying about grades, prom dates, pimples...

58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,150
不用担心生命危险！
not their own survival!

59
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,040
妈妈 黑暗能量正从地下向外井喷
Mom, Dark Energon is pouring out of the Earth.

60
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,490
这不正常
It doesn't do that.

61
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,180
可能关系到所有人的性命
This could be about everyone's survival

62
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,410
不光是我们的
not just ours.

63
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,230
你们必须跟我走
You're coming with me

64
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,510
三个人都走
all three of you.

65
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,980
他们不会再回来了
And they will not be coming back.

66
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,650
我理解
I understand.

67
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,580
这就完了？
That's it?

68
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,050
同甘共苦这么久 一句“再见”就打发了？
After all we've been through together, "see ya"?

69
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,250
我们不是可以自由选择吗？
What about our freedom to choose?

70
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,810
那是他们星球的东西
That may fly on their planet

71
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,500
在地球上行不通
but not here on Earth.

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,750
上车
Get in.

73
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,750
你以为我会坐一辆不会变形的汽车吗？
Do you really expect me to ride in a non-transforming vehicle?

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
神子 我是认真的
Miko, I'm serious.

75
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,140
你又不是我妈
You're not my mother.

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,380
神子…
Miko...

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,780
你也不是！
Neither are you!

78
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,560
好吧 我是你妈对吧
Well, I am yours.

79
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
我们走 杰克
Let's go, Jack.

80
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,740
她毕竟是你妈妈
She is your mom.

81
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,980
我要留下
I'm staying.

82
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,220
救护车 启动环陆桥
Ratchet, activate the GroundBridge.

84
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,710
谢了 不必
No, thank you.

85
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,330
擎天柱 能收到吗？
Prime, do you copy?

86
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,420
听到了 福勒探员
I hear you, Agent Fowler.

87
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,770
看新闻了吗？
Been watching the news?

88
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,190
大自然母亲的鼻孔发痒了
Mother nature's got a twitch in her breaches.

89
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,020
我们知道火山喷发的事
We know about the volcano.

90
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,220
那地震呢？
And the quakes?

91
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,860
七次大地震的震级分毫不差 而且跟火山喷发的时间完全吻合
Seven major temblors of the exact the same magnitude at the exact same time as the volcanic eruption.

92
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,730
地震分布在全球各个火山岩板块 按理说毫不相干 可它们却在…
All over the globe on different plutonic plates, in theory unrelated, if they hadn't happened...

93
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
同一时刻爆发
At the exact same time.

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,770
来看看 还有好消息
Check it out, more good news.

95
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,470
可怕的风暴让当地人目瞪口呆
Freak storms unlike any the region has seen

96
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,830
海啸使加拿大沿岸岌岌可危
tsunamis threaten the Canadian coast

97
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,210
雷暴也在戈壁滩上肆虐横行
while lightning storms pummel the Gobi Desert.

98
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,640
与此同时 电磁异常现象在城市电网中蔓延
Meanwhile, electro-magnetic anomalies plague urban power grids.

99
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,980
这些全球性的反常现象引发众人追问：\N怎么会这样 还能怎么样？
These abnormal global phenomena are leaving most to wonder: why now, and what next?

100
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,840
别告诉我 虎子们造了个天气控制仪
Don't tell me your 'Cons've built a weather machine.

101
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,030
能操纵天气？
One that powerful?

102
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,430
基本不可能
Highly unlikely.

103
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:43,270
我认为 黑暗能量在这个节骨眼上出现 决不是巧合
I do not believe the appearance of Dark Energon at this point in time to be coincidental.

104
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,270
一秒钟 两秒钟…
One 100, two 100...

105
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,170
你还好吧 拉夫？
You OK back there, Raf?

106
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,040
我看见闪电了
I saw lightning.

107
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,620
所以在数秒 等雷声…
I'm counting until the thunder...

108
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,530
嗯哼 看来要起风暴了
Huh, looks like a storm.

109
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,120
我的花园可遭殃了
My garden will love it.

110
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,610
拉夫 你没事吧？
Raf, are you ok?

111
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,420
嗯
Hmm.

112
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,100
那是什么？
What's that?

113
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,730
不…
No.

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,170
快点 快点 快点！
Come on, come on, come on!

115
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,030
小蜂让咱们爬到他手上！
Bee wants us to climb into his hand.

116
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,460
谢谢
Thank you.

117
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,030
他说“不客气”
He says "You are welcome."

118
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:36,850
喷涌你的生命之血 从深渊中崛起 和我融为一体！
Reverse of your very life blood rising from the depth to become one with me.

119
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,070
我们回来了
We are back.

120
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,560
我们也放心了
And we are glad.

121
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,600
你还好吗？
Are you alright?

122
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,590
我会好起来的 杰克…
I will be. Jack...

123
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,720
妈妈 我…
Mom, I...

124
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,220
我知道 我也是
I know, me too.

125
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,450
但你得禁足到30岁…25岁吧
But you're grounded till you're 30... 25.

126
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,340
各国领导人将这次奇异的天气状况 定性为全球性紧急事件
World leaders are classifying these bizarre weather patterns as a global emergency.

127
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,820
全球性的？
Global?

128
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,310
科学家们认为 该现象或多或少
And scientists believe the phenomena to be somehow

129
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,010
和近期的星球串联有关
related to the current planetary alignment.

130
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,420
有什么发现 擎天柱？
What have you learned, Prime?

131
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,250
你最好别跟我扯淡…
And you'd better not blow smoke up my ass...

132
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,890
达比小姐 真是个美丽的邂逅
Miss Darby, What a nice surprise.

133
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,540
福勒探员
Special Agent Fowler.

134
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,650
这就是我们的发现：跟火山中所谓的岩浆一样
We have learned this: as with the so called magma from the volcano

135
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,640
这些地震源自地壳以下极深的位置
these earthquakes originated far below the Earth's crust...

136
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,740
实际上 震源就在地核的正中央
from the very center of the Earth's core in fact.

137
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,340
一般的地震不是这样 对吧？
Quakes don't start there, do they?

138
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:02,070
细微的震颤呈固定的节奏起伏 就像是…
Tiny tremors rising and falling in a consistent pattern, almost like...

139
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,350
看在火种源的份上…
by the All Spark...

140
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,440
如果把这些数据点 转换成声音文件的话…
If I convert these data points to audio files...

141
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,240
怎么 什么东西？
What, what is it?

142
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,970
听
Listen.

143
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,910
停 声波 关掉它！
Stop, Soundwave. Turn it off.

144
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,180
我的脑袋要被它震裂了！
I can still hear it pounding in my brain!

145
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,100
塞博特恩人的心跳？
Cybertronian heartbeat?

146
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,400
这怎么可能？
How was that possible?

147
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,800
心脏泵的是血
A heart pumps blood.

148
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,260
地球内部没有能流通的东西 除了…
There is nothing inside the Earth to pump except...

149
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,490
宇宙大帝之血
Blood of Unicron.

150
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,510
我苏醒了！
I awakened.

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,880
好吧 先打住
Ok, hold on.

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,930
你的意思是 地底下有个活物
You mean something's living down there

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,610
就在地球里边？
inside our planet?

154
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,700
恐怕 地核并不是由岩浆组成的
I fear that the Earth's very core is not comprised of magma

155
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,740
这和人类科学有出入 但应该是黑暗能量
as your science has suggested, but of Dark Energon.

156
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,770
如果我们听到的是火种
And if we're hearing a spark

157
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,140
那么宇宙大帝就是崛起的黑暗势力 如预言所说
then Unicron is the rising darkness that the prophecy foretold.

158
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,600
好吧 怎么才能让这东西趴着不动呢？
So how do we stop this thing from rising?

159
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,020
恐怕预言对此并没有提及
That I'm afraid was not foretold.

160
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,260
地核里面怎么会有别的东西呢 而且还是活的？
How can something be in our Earth core and be alive?

161
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,420
这种情况不是没有先例
Such a thing is not unprecedented.

162
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,560
在创世之初
Before the beginning

163
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,780
世间只有原始天尊 以及宇宙大帝
there was Primus. And there was Unicron.

164
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,980
一方是造物主的化身
One, the incarnation of creation

165
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,940
而另一方 是毁灭的代言人
the other... of destruction.

166
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,110
亘古以来 原始天尊和宇宙大帝频繁交战
For eons, Primus and Unicron battled

167
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,540
二者实力不相上下 无数个回合难分胜负
the balance of power shifting between them more times than could be counted.

168
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,360
后来 原始天尊创造出十三位领袖――
Only by creating the Thirteen--

169
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,260
也就是我的几位前任领袖――
the original Primes preceded me--

170
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,570
才使自己最终战胜了宇宙大帝 并将他流放
was Primus finally able to defeat Unicron and cast him out.

171
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,570
原始天尊融入我们星球的核心
Primus became one with the very core of our planet

172
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,890
通过火种源之井创造生命
creating life through the Well of All Sparks

173
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,570
而宇宙大帝从此销声匿迹 如今却重返江湖
while Unicron was never to be heard from again... until now.

174
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,310
也许我们能找到这个钻地虎当年进入地心时 挖出的洞口
Maybe we can find the hole this kuggo Con left when he dug himself all the way down there

175
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,510
在里面填满炸药
and fill it full of explosives.

176
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,010
福勒探员
Agent Fowler

177
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,330
我认为 并非是宇宙大帝想在地球安家
I do not believe that Earth became Unicron's home

178
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,620
而是随着时间推移和重力作用
but rather that with time and gravitational force

179
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,260
星体碎屑聚拢在这个沉睡的巨人周围
debris collected around this slumbering titan.

180
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,650
这才造就了你们的地球
Forming your Earth itself.

181
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,260
他现在才睡醒 是因为星球串联形成了强大的磁吸力吗？
And he's only awakening now, due to the magnetic pull created by the planetary alignment?

182
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,440
好吧 宇宙大帝用几十亿年打了个盹儿 现在要干嘛？
Ok, what happens now when Unicron wakes up from his billion-year nap?

183
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,690
是啊 难道他伸个懒腰就“砰”的一声 地球灰飞烟灭了？
Yeah, does he stretch and ka-pow... Earth pup to dust?

184
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,750
你也不知道 对吧？
You don't know, do you?

185
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,300
我猜想 宇宙大帝的身躯应该和传说中一样 硕大无比
My guess is that Unicron has transcended physical form as we know it.

186
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:37,680
尽管如此 我们必须想办法确保这个“不可抗力”…
Nonetheless, we must find a way to ensure that this "force of nature" never fully awakens.

187
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,570
你们星球的命运在此一举
The fate of your planet depends upon it.

188
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,900
威震天陛下 货舱差不多被黑暗物质堆满了
Lord Megatron, our cargo hold is nearly filled with the dark substance.

189
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,470
我建议收兵
I recommend a retreat

190
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,190
战士们受黑暗能量的影响 越来越虚弱
the troops are growing weak from its effects.

191
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,780
但我却感到空前强大
And yet I grow stronger.

192
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,500
毒蜘蛛 你负责指挥 等我回来
Airachnid, you're in command until my return.

193
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,050
您这是要去哪儿 主人？
Your return from where, Master?

194
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,770
去会会宇宙大帝
From my audience with Unicron.

195
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,480
我感受到您的存在
I feel your presents

196
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,530
分享您尊贵的火种！
share your very spark.

197
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,560
我专程来拜访您 我的阁下和主人 全能的宇宙大帝！
I call on you as my Lord and Master, almighty Unicron.

198
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,880
谁在和我说话？
Who would speak to me?

199
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,980
您最谦卑的仆人
Your servant most humble

200
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,360
威震天 霸天虎的统帅
Megatron, leader of the Decepticons

201
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,100
您忠诚的使者
and your very Herald

202
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,630
是我运用黑暗能量 将你我联系在一起
the one who wielded the Dark Energon which binds us

203
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,670
使您再次苏醒 最终验证了预言！
to awaken you once again. The prophecy has been fulfilled.

204
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,990
我们即将共创一番大业 强强联手！
It is only the beginning of what we shall accomplish, together!

205
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,290
为您统治这颗星球 连同所有的生命 我将义不容辞！
For you shall rule this planet and those who walk upon it through me.

206
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,680
痴人说梦！
Pride for fool.

207
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,950
你竟然以为 自己有资格召唤我的生命力？
How dare you think yourself capable of summoning my life force?

208
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:27,500
我苏醒 是因为我感觉时机已到！
I rise because I have deemed my time.

209
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,820
主人 我无意以下犯上
Master, I did not mean to overstep.

210
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,610
闭嘴 蠕虫！
Silence, worm!

211
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,980
我无需一个下人插手此事
I have no need of your lowly assistance.

212
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,580
求您了 我的陛下
Please, my Lord.

213
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,510
我此生只为您效忠！
I exist only to serve you.

214
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,080
这是什么味道？
What is this I sense?

215
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,650
原始天尊的遗骨吗？这里也有？！
The taint of Primus? Here?!

216
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,120
那是擎天柱
That is Optimus

217
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,220
最后一个领袖 我们的死敌
the last of the Primes, our sworn enemy.

218
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,690
你口口声声说对我尽忠
You profess loyalty to me

219
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,600
却放任原始天尊的门徒活到今天？！
yet allow a disciple of Primus to live?!

220
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,500
我会为您消灭他！
I will destroy him for you!

221
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,150
他的惨叫会响彻…
His screams will be heard...

222
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,440
你的花言巧语我听够了
I grow weary of your prattle.

223
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,200
显然 如果你有实力消灭这个领袖
Surely if you had the power to destroy this Prime

224
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,680
你早该做到了
you would have done so already.

225
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,390
我还是亲自处理他吧
I will deal with him myself.

226
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,040
救护车 这个震源的特征和其他几处基本一致
Ratchet, this epicenter is consistent with the findings of the others.

227
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,450
地下矿藏非常丰富
Its terrain is rich in ore.

228
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,840
那是什么意思？
So what does that tell us?

229
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,970
这表示 你们地球上的天然金属矿
It follows that the natural medals in your Earth

230
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,570
就是宇宙大帝的扩展部分 相当于他的四肢
would be extensions of Unicron-- his limbs if you will.

231
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,840
这么说 他的确伸了个懒腰
So, he did have his morning stretch

232
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,270
所以才引发了地震
which is why these quakes happened.

233
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,090
擎天柱 我发现宇宙大帝火种的活性急剧增强
Optimus, I'm detecting a swell of Unicron's spark activity.

234
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,360
放心吧 救护车
Rest assured, Ratchet

235
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,790
我会提高警惕的
I will proceed with vigilance.

236
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,750
你认识我吗 原始天尊的追随者？
Do you know me, follower of Primus?

237
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,790
宇宙大帝 混沌制造者
Unicron, the Chaos Bringer.

238
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,500
很好
Good.

239
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:27,060
现在 称我为宇宙大帝――你的毁灭者！
Now know me as Unicron, your destroyer!

240
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,170
我恳求您听我一言 尊敬的宇宙大帝
I humbly request your ear, Lord Unicron.

241
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,410
一个如此低三下四的领袖 到底要说什么？
And what would a Prime be so compelled to say to me?

242
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,080
我的请求不是为自己
I make this appeal not for myself

243
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,210
而是为这个由您构建的星球 以及栖居其上的生命体
but for this planet which you constitute, and the beings who inhabit it.

244
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,880
人类依赖于您 才能繁衍生息
Human kind relies upon you, for life, sustenance.

245
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,980
您的复活只会导致这个物种走向毁灭
Your resurrection will only result in the destruction of a spices

246
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,860
而它恰恰是由您的伟大子孙孕育而生的
which evolved from the seeds of your very greatness.

247
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,570
那么你所说的这种人类
So this humankind of whom you speak

248
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,910
它们也算是我的后裔吗？
you consider them my progeny?

249
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,810
没错
Indeed.

250
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,190
是寄生虫！它们也会领教到我的怒火
Parasites! They, too, shall know my wrathful hand

251
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
但我要先和你把账算清！
once I am finished with you.

252
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:45,030
多日不见 原始天尊的氏族竟如此衰败 今天你陨落无疑！
The line of Primus has grown weak in my absence, and thus you shall fall.

253
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,540
汽车人固有一死
That outcome is inevitable

254
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,160
但今天不是时候！
but not on this day.

255
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,530
是的 原始天尊的门徒 就在今天
Yes, disciple of Primes, on this very day.

256
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:26,760
宇宙大帝之名独一无二 但我们都是宇宙大帝！
For Unicron may be one, but we all are Unicron.
