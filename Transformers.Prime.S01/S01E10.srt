1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,300
留堂 唉
Bfff... Detention. Uh!

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,500
我爱死这首歌了！
I love this song! Yea... Braagagaga...

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,500
神子
Miko.

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
你不是要做历史报告吗？
I thought you had a history report to do.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,300
老师提前下课了？
Did detention end early?

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,200
我自己提前的
It did for me.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,200
啊喔 老师追出来了
Aho, here comes teacher

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,800
她脸色不太好
and she doesn't look happy.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,700
快踩油门 隔板！
Step on it, Bulkhead!

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,000
唉 神子啊
Eh, Miko.

11
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
神子 我是你的保镖
Miko, I'm supposed to be your guardian

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
不是你的逃学专车
not your get-away car.

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,500
你可不能逃课啊
You can't just cut detention.

14
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,800
你父母知道了怎么办？
What if your parents found out?

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
他们在东京呢 忘了吗？
They live in Tokyo, remember?

16
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,300
寄宿监护人就更不用说了
And don't even worry about host parents.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,500
他们被我吓坏了
I think I scared them.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
神子 听着
Miko, listen.

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,400
如果你中学肄业 就没法进那个…
If you fail high school. You can't go to... uh.. to the...

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,200
大…阿…西…约… 那个词儿怎么说来着？
Uh... Una... i... Wait wait wait what's that word again?

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
呃 大学吗？
Uh, college?

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,200
你说话跟我父母一样
 You sound like my parents.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,500
他们不是日本人吗？
Aren't they Japanese?

24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
你们的语言是不一样
They make speak a different language

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,900
可内容都是老一套
but you say the same things.

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,100
因为我们都是为你好
Because we want the best for you

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,900
也就是说 希望你去上学 而不是坐牢
and that means making sure you go to school, not jail.

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,400
啊喔 你又闯什么祸了？
Uho, what did you do?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,500
听着 神子 我在成为战士之前
Look, Miko, before I became a warrior

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,600
是个工人 建筑工
I was a laborer, construction.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,300
我能造东西 也能拆东西 可别的都不会
I can build stuff, I can break stuff. And that's it.

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,700
我喜欢拆东西！
I love breaking stuff.

33
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,600
我想和你一样 小隔
 I want to be just like you, Bulk.

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,500
呃 干嘛要跟我一样
Uh, why would you want to be like me

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,800
其实你可以当个…医生 就像救护车
when you can be a... a medic, like Rachet.

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,200
我发现了一个新的能量脉冲
I'm detecting a fresh energon pos

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,900
地点是一个叫希腊的国家
 from a nation called Greece.

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,500
是座古城 历史应该很悠久
An ancient city, quite historical, I belief.

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,600
古希腊是吗？
Ancient Greece, uh?

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,500
又要实地考察了
A field trip!

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,400
来的正是时候 击倒
It's about time, Knockout.

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,300
我不喜欢被人放鸽子
I do not enjoy being kept waiting.

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,700
路程很远的 红蜘蛛
Ahh, it was a long drive, Starscream.

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,400
我现在还在清理保险杠上的垃圾呢
I'm still picking bugs out of my grille.

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,500
是的 没错 你也是其中之一
Yes, right. You're one of those.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,900
什么意思？
Come again?

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,000
真想不通 一个有自尊的霸天虎 怎么会选择汽车当作伪装形态呢
Never understood why any self-respecting Decepticon would choose automobile as his vehicle mode.

48
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
选飞机不是更潇洒吗？
when it could have flight.

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,600
我喜欢那种钢丝子午线轮胎
I like the way I look in steel belted radials.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,000
我听说 威震天陛下需要点医疗协助？
I take it that lord Megatron requires a laboratory assist?

51
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,200
可以这么说
You might say that.

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
我们到了
Here we are.

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,600
太棒了！
S-weet!

54
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,000
好了 我们来希腊古镇要干嘛？
So, what are we doing in Greek old ville?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
我要搜索能量
I am scouting energon.

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,700
你去准备你的历史报告
You are doing research for your history report.

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
你敢阴我 老隔？没劲！
You punked me Bulk? Not cool!

58
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
信号很强
Signal strong.

59
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
是个发掘遗址
Excavation site!

60
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,000
我对建筑很在行
I know construction.

61
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,000
从扫描结果看来 人类挖到了能量矿
According to my scanner humans had energon vans.

62
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
可他们对此一无所知
And they don't even know it.

63
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
那是塞博特恩的东西
That's Cybertronian.

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,100
很可惜 我们的前任领袖威震天 已经昏死很久了
Sadly, our inevitably former lord Megatron has been like this for some time.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
经过全体人员的投票表决
But the crew took a vote and it was decided that

66
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,900
希望找到一个专家 让他恢复元气
an expert might put him on the road to recovery.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,100
我的确对身体结构有点研究 红蜘蛛
I've done plenty of body-works, Starscream

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,300
但我擅长的是拆毁 不是复原
 but I'm at breaking them than fixing them.

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
要是我的助手在就好了
Uh, would help if I had my assistant.

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,500
我把你们俩都召来了 他人呢？
I summoned both of you. Where is he?

71
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,800
你呼叫的时候 我们正在考察一处能量踪迹
We were halt on an energon trail when you called.

72
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,800
侦察完毕 打击就会来了
Breakdown will show when he's through scouting it.

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
古希腊人为什么要画能量收割器？
Why would ancient Greeks paint of energon harvester.

74
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,000
你认识那个圆球吗？
You know what that round thing is?

75
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
你好像开窍了
You are smarter than you led on.

76
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
但开窍得有点晚了
But even dumber than he looks.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
打击
Breakdown.

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,300
哼哼 想我了吗？
Hehehe, miss me?

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
我会想念车盘的铁锈吗？
Like rest of my undercarriage.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,700
你认识那个呆子？
You know this lunkhead?

81
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
我们打过交道
We have a history.

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,300
你还养了个宠物
And you have a pet.

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,900
它会玩接球吗？
Does it play catch?

84
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,200
接着！
Catch!

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,700
神子 趴下！
Miko, stay down!

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
哎呀
Oops.

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,000
但愿那风景画不算太值钱
Hope that pretty picture wasn't too important.

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
我说过 我很会拆东西
Told you I'm good at breaking things.

89
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,800
我替你留了一手 老隔
I always have you back, Bulk.

90
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,200
我把那幅画拍下来了
Got us a picture of the picture.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
的确是能量收割器
It is indeed an energon harvester.

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,200
古汽车人发明了这个强大的工具
A powerful tool created by the ancients

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,200
用来吸取各种原生能量
to remove raw energon from any source.

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
希腊众神也认识汽车人吗？
Greek gods knew Autobots?

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,900
不
No.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,600
古人当时通常用画来隐藏信息
The ancients often use the art of a given era to conceal messages.

97
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,500
这幅壁画很可能指出了收割器所在的位置
This fresco is likely a sign post indicating a harvester's location

98
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,600
就在这个星球的某个角落
hidden somewhere on this planet.

99
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,700
呃 擎天柱
Uh, Optimus.

100
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,700
如果收割器能吸取一切能量
 If the harvester removes energon from anything

101
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,600
那你们体内的能量怎么办？
and you all have energon pumping inside you...

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
如果落入霸天虎之手
In Decepticon hands

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,600
收割器将变成毁灭性的武器
the harvester would be a devastating weapon.

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,100
你看 你毁掉那幅画太明智了
See, you are a genius to total that painting.

105
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
神子说的没错
Miko's not wrong.

106
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,800
没有了壁画 虎子们去哪儿找收割器？
How can the Cons find the harvester without the Fresco?

107
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,400
当然是高速互联网了
With high speed internet?

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,300
在图片中搜索希腊神祗和金球
If we do an image search for Greek God and Gold orb

109
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,600
就能搜到这个
this pops up.

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,900
在一个博物馆里
It's in a museum.

111
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
那是真货吗？
That the real deal?

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,500
联系福勒探员
Contact Agent Fowler.

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
这是威廉・福勒特工的电话号码
You've reached Special Agent William Fowler.

114
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,100
我正在进行秘密强化训练
I've currently on an intensive training retreat.

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,800
周二之前不会回来
And I'm not available until Tuesday.

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
我讨厌跟机器说话
I hate talking to machines.

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,700
既然福勒探员没办法出面
Without Agent Fowler's direct aid

118
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,300
我们就要亲自没收收割器了
we will have to confiscate the harvester on our own.

119
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,700
喔…“没收”？
Well, well, well, confiscate?

120
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,700
那是盗窃博物馆财产
 As in steal museum property?

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,100
听起来是…非法行为
That sounds illegal.

122
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,200
我也不想触犯人类法律
I do not wish to break human law.

123
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,900
可一旦霸天虎得知收割器的位置
But once the Decepticons learn of the harvester's location

124
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,000
他们会不惜任何手段 把它据为己有
they will not hesitate to obtain it by any means necessary.

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,400
我们必须隐蔽行动
We must act covertly.

126
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
好吧 说句不好听的 擎天柱
Ehe, OK, no offense, Optimus.

127
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,500
让巨型机器人执行隐蔽行动实在不靠谱
But, covertly and giant robots don't really go together.

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,100
博物馆是公共场所
Museums are public.

129
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,100
里面有保安 还有安全摄像头
And they have guards and security cameras.

130
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
没问题！
No problem!

131
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,200
我们个子小 可以溜进去
We are small enough to sneak in

132
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,500
而且我们不是秘密势力
and we are not a government secret.

133
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
神子 我觉得这么做不太明智
Miko, I'm not sure that's wise.

134
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,100
但也许是我们的最佳选择 隔板
But it may be our best option, Bulkhead.

135
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
我们争论得越久
The longer we debate

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,100
给霸天虎留下的时间就越多
the more time we give to the Decepticons.

137
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,900
肯定就是那个
Umhm, that's definitely it.

138
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,400
恐怕威震天的康复工作要先放在一边了
And I'm afraid Megatron's well-being will have to wait.

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,800
收割的时候到了
It's harvest time.

140
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,300
汽车人 确认位置
Autobots, confirm position.

141
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
西侧搞定
Westward held.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
南侧没问题
South side covered.

143
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,800
保持警戒
Maintain your guard.

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,100
杰克 神子 拉斐尔
Jack, Miko, Raphael

145
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,100
我会密切监控你们周围的情况
I will have a clear view of you.

146
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,500
只要拿到了收割器
Once you secure the harvester

147
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,900
我就让救护车把你们传送回基地
I will contact Ratchet to bridge you back to base.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,400
我送你们绕过所有的普通入口
I'll send you bypass all points of normal entry.

149
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,300
不用担心会触发警报器
You won't need to worry about setting off the alarm.

150
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,800
但千万别碰到什么保安
But take care to avoid any security guards.

151
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
找到啦！
Oppa!

152
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,100
轮圈很帅嘛 24寸轮胎是吧？
Sweet rims, 24-gage?

153
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,100
你的分量还真够重的
You are really heavy duty

154
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
和我这位朋友一样
just like my friend here.

155
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,200
是虎子！
It's Cons.

156
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,800
他们打倒了擎天柱
They got Optimus.

157
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,100
什么？
What?

158
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
快走 该撤退了 兄弟们！
Come on, time to make our exit, boys.

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
呃…有事吗？
Uh, what's up?

160
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,700
你最好跟我来 小姐
You'd better come with me, miss.

161
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,200
坏了
Not good.

162
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,400
阿尔茜！
Arcee!

163
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
是声波！
It's Soundwave.

164
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,000
嗯 我的猎物是它
Hmm... That would be game.

165
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,400
虎子抢走了收割器！
The Cons have the harbester.

166
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
保安抢走了神子！
And security has Miko!

167
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,600
什么？我进去找她
What? I'm going in after her.

168
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
隔板 神子可能被暂时扣留
Bulkhead, Miko may be detained

169
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
但她没有任何危险
but she is safe from harm.

170
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,100
听着 小鬼 如果你在搞恶作剧
Look, kid, if this is some kind of a prank

171
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,300
告诉你 政府已经派人过来了
you need to know that the authorities are on their way.

172
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,400
想尽快脱身的话 快告诉我那个金球去哪儿了？
It'd go a whole lot easier for you if you just told me what happened to the sphere.

173
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
我要准备我的历史报告
I was researching my history report

174
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,300
结果忘了闭馆时间 就被关在里面了
I just lost track of time and got locked in here after closing.

175
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,000
那你的历史报告是什么内容？
So what's your history report about?

176
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
我很想知道
 I'd love to know.

177
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
呃…
Eh...

178
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,500
红蜘蛛极有可能使用收割器 迅速收集到巨大能量
In all likelihood Starscream will use the harvester to gather as much energon as quickly as he can

179
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,700
他会选择星球上无法常规开采的能量矿
from the planet's otherwise un-minable energon deposits.

180
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,000
一定要小心行动
Approach with extreme caution.

181
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,200
红蜘蛛一定希望把收割器用在我们身上
Starscream will not hesitate to turn the harvester on any one of us.

182
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
隔板
Bulkhead

183
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,800
你最好留在这里
it is best that you remain here.

184
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,800
让我去博物馆救出神子吗？
So I can bust Miko out of the museum?

185
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,900
让你协助救护车
So you can help Ratchet.

186
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,000
你虽然是神子的保镖
You may be Miko's guardian

187
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,600
但眼下她需要的是人类的帮忙
but she requires human assistance.

188
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,400
最好请福勒探员走一趟
Agent Fowler remains our best option.

189
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,900
这是威廉・福勒特工的电话号码
You've reached special Agent William Fowler.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
我正在进行秘密强化训练
I'm currently on an intensive training retreat

191
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,400
周二之前不会回来
and I’m not available until Tuesday.

192
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,000
还是无人接听
Still not answered.

193
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,400
福勒肯定是在海景别墅享福呢
Fowler's lounging around some poolside cabana.

194
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,300
隔板 那个我还有用呐！
Bulkhead, I needed that!

195
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
我们能救出神子
We can free Miko

196
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,800
只要把收割器归还博物馆就行了
if we can just return that harvester to the museum.

197
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,700
好让霸天虎再去偷走吗？
So that Decepticons can steal it all over again?

198
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
我真是笨到家了！
I am so dumb!

199
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
那我们该怎么帮神子？
So how are we going to help Miko?

200
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
把这个复制品还给博物馆
By returning this replica to the museum

201
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,800
这东西本来很快就能做好了
The construction of which would be going a whole lot faster

202
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
可隔板把我的车床砸了个稀烂！
if Bulkhead hadn't just mangled my frame wielder!

203
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,100
我们已经当过入侵者和窃贼了
We're already trespassers and thieves

204
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,900
再加一条伪造罪也无所谓
why not add forgery to the list?

205
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
我真不该带神子去那个…
I wish I had never taken Miko to the...

206
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,200
除了收割器的壁画 我们在遗迹还发现了别的东西
the painting of the harvester isn't the only thing we found in those ruins.

207
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,600
我没听懂
I'm sorry?

208
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,500
红蜘蛛可不笨
Starscream is not dumb.

209
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,400
不管他有什么工具
No matter what kind of tool he has

210
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,600
他总想走捷径
he is going to take the easy route.

211
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
干嘛还要去开山修路呢
Why move maintains now

212
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,600
手头上不是有这么多现成的能量吗？
when we have a motherload of energon right here for the taking

213
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,100
真要感谢古代汽车人留下的这份礼物
courtesy of this gift from the ancient Autobots.

214
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,700
呃 其实 红蜘蛛指挥官
Uh, actually, commander Starscream

215
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
送礼的人是打击和在下
it was a gift from breakdown and myself.

216
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,700
喔 那么多能量 都收集在这个小容器里边
Oh, that energon, in such a tiny vessel.

217
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,900
那帮远古的汽车人的确心灵手巧 红蜘蛛陛下
Those ancient Autobots never missed a trick, lord Starscream.

218
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
呃 糟了
Um, scrap.

219
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,100
去去就来！
Back for seconds.

220
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
你个头很大
You are a big one.

221
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
吸收时间要长一点了
This could take a while.

222
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,400
等等 你要干嘛？
Wait, what are you doing?

223
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,700
干我的老本行！
What I do best!

224
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,000
拆东西！
Breaking things!

225
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,600
他好像很喜欢接受惩罚
He is a glutton for punishment.

226
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,800
打吗？
Fight?

227
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
嗯 撤吧
Um, drive.

228
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
嘿
Hey.

229
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,400
当然了 首先要知道什么是机器之神
And of course there is this whole principle of Deus ex Machina.

230
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,400
呃 就是用机器制造的神
Uh, the god from the machine.

231
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,400
在希腊戏剧里面 充当神的角色突然出现 解决所有问题
It's that part in Greek story telling when some character shows up out of the blue to make everything right.

232
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,400
是吗 小姑娘
That's so, young lady.

233
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,400
我敢肯定 警察会喜欢听你编的这些历史故事的
Well, I am sure the police will want to hear all about you history report.

234
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,700
我是特工威廉・福勒
Special Agent William Fowler

235
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,500
失窃财产已经被找到 并归还给博物馆了
the stolen property has been located and restored in museum premises.

236
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,200
这女孩我带走
The girl comes with me.

237
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
你的手机掉了
You dropped you cell phone.

238
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,200
在地上找到的 就在你的历史报告旁边
Found on the floor right next to your history report.

239
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,300
你走吧
Off you go.

240
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,700
来得正好 老隔！
Good timing, Bulk.

241
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,100
那些野史我都讲完了
I was running out of history factoids-

242
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
都快要编不下去了！
-stuff I didn't even know I knew.

243
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,600
看来你也有点开窍了
Looks like you are smarter than you led on?

244
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,100
压力就是动力
Under pressure.

245
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,800
我也一样
Me, too.

246
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,600
一定得赶快把历史报告写完
Can't wait to finish my history report.

247
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,000
我要详细论述汽车人和古文明接触的那段历史
I'm gonna write all about how the Autobots interacted with ancient civilizations.

248
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,900
呃 那个可不能保证你上大学 神子
Uh, I'm not so sure that will get you into college, Miko.
