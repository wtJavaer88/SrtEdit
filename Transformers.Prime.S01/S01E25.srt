1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,130
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime:

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,860
可怕的风暴让当地人目瞪口呆
Freak storms unlike any the region has seen

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,980
海啸使加拿大沿岸岌岌可危
tsunamis threaten the Canadian coast

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,340
雷暴也在戈壁滩上肆虐横行
while lightning storms pummel the Gobi Desert.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,180
恐怕 地核并不是由岩浆组成的
I fear that the Earth's very core is not comprised of magma

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,990
而是黑暗能量
but of Dark Energon.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,260
看在火种源的份上…
By the allspark...

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,940
塞博特恩人的心跳？
Cybertronian heartbeat?

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,920
你的意思是 地底下有个活物
You mean something's living down there

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,550
就在地球里边？
inside our planet?

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,390
是“宇宙大帝” 远古的恶魔
Unicron, an ancient evil

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,070
他的血液在石化之后 形成了我们所说的那种黑暗能量…
whose fossilized blood comprises the matter which we call Dark Energon...

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,900
痴人说梦！
Pride for fool.

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,940
我无需一个下人插手此事
I have no need of your lowly assistance.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,940
擎天柱 我发现宇宙大帝火种的活性急剧增强
I'm detecting a swell of Unicron's spark activity.

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,630
现在 称我为宇宙大帝――你的毁灭者！
Now know me as Unicron, your destroyer!

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,920
擎天柱 你发现宇宙大帝苏醒的其他迹象了吗？
Optimus, have you uncovered any further sign of Unicron's emergence?

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,090
宇宙大帝是力量的化身
Unicron is power incarnate

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,700
而你 最后一个领袖
and you, the last of the Primes

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,760
将步向死亡！
shall perish.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,550
看来回答是肯定的
I take that as a yes.

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,040
我们这就出发！
We are on our way.

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,360
不行
Negative.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,440
单靠蛮力是无法打倒宇宙大帝的
Unicron cannot be defeated by sheer force.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,580
他要的是我 救护车
He wants me, Ratchet.

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,330
这场战斗必须由我独自面对
This fight must be mine alone.

27
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,280
难道救护车没有传达我的命令吗？
Did Ratchet not relay my command?

28
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,940
返回基地
Return to base.

29
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,240
援兵也挽回不了你即将毁灭的下场
Reinforcements will not prevent your destruction

30
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,690
原始天尊的门徒
disciple of Primus.

31
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,790
擎天柱 宇宙大帝的目标是你
Optimus, you are Unicron's target

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,070
也许你才应该返回基地
maybe you should consider returning to the base.

33
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,270
在宇宙大帝的化身面前 地球上没有任何藏身之处
These manifestations of Unicron can locate me anywhere on Earth

34
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,890
即使是基地的屏障 也只能在短时间内隐藏我的位置
even our base's shielding will only cloak my position for so long.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,280
我不能让其他人身处险境
I will not put others at risk.

36
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,590
那就撤退 我们来开路
Then fall back and let us take the lead

37
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,020
就这一次
just this once.

38
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,570
请理智一点吧
Please listen to reason.

39
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,820
万一你牺牲了 擎天柱
If you don't survive, Optimus

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,380
恐怕这星球也活不成了
I fear neither will this planet.

41
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,700
那好吧
Very well.

42
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,940
我们走！
Let's move.

43
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,960
不 这不是宇宙大帝的真身
No, not Unicron himself

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,790
只是他的另一个化身而已
but another of his manifestations.

45
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,480
既然我们打不过宇宙大帝
If we can't beat Unicron

46
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,930
而且跑也跑不过他
and we can't out run him.

47
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,130
我们到底该怎么办？
What exactly are we supposed to do?

48
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,280
我们所能做的…
All we can do...

49
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,530
只有尽快消灭这些傀儡
neutralize his vassals as they appear

50
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,030
直到找出办法 既能消灭他 又不必毁掉我们脚下的这颗星球
until we find a way to destroy him without destroying the very Earth upon which we walk.

51
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,170
愚蠢
Fool.

52
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,370
我就是这个世界的过去 也是它的将来
I am this world's past, and its future

53
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,690
鉴于目前的状况…
and as of this moment...

54
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,090
不！
No!

55
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,930
所有的领袖都将成为历史
All Primes are simply past.

56
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,880
不是我
Wasn't me.

57
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,860
也不是我
Me neither.

58
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,800
救护车？
Ratchet?

59
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,820
怎么了？是谁干的？
What is it? What happened?

60
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,120
是我干的
I happened.

61
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,190
威震天！
Megatron!

62
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,060
金刚虎王也来了？
King Kong's there, too?

63
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,780
他已经投靠了宇宙大帝
He has aligned himself with Unicron.

64
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,100
别这么肯定
Don't be so sure.

65
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,070
威震天刚刚救了擎天柱的命
Megatron just saved Optimus' tailpipe.

66
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,570
真是出乎意料 你我上次还刀兵相见
It is rather ironic considering our last encounter.

67
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,000
如果没记错 你当时无论如何都要熄灭我的火种
If my memory serves, you were desperately attempting to extinguish my spark.

68
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,900
那是我一贯的想法
That option remains very much in play.

69
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,850
我也不指望你心慈手软
I would expect nothing less.

70
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,520
不过 我有个提议
However, I have a proposal.

71
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,280
和我联手 打败我们共同的敌人
Join me in defeating our shared enemy

72
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,640
宇宙大帝 混沌制造者
Unicron, the Chaos Bringer.

73
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,870
哈！荒唐！
Ha! Absurd.

74
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,110
宇宙大帝是邪恶的化身
Unicron is evil incarnate.

75
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,140
如果威震天要选择阵营的话
If Megatron was to take any side

76
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,220
干嘛要选我们这边？
why would it be ours?

77
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:09,040
因为威震天的尊严使他不能容忍 自己以外的任何人统治这个星球
Because Megatron's pride would never allow anyone other than himself to rule this planet.

78
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,130
你真是太了解我了 擎天柱
You know me all too well, Optimus.

79
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,250
你手下有一支虎头大军
You lead an army of Cons

80
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,630
还来找我们干嘛？
why come to us?

81
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,630
因为这次特殊行动 需要一种我驾驭不了的力量――
Because this particular endeavor requires something beyond the realm of my command--

82
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,460
领袖的力量
-- the power of a Prime.

83
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,610
哼 那看来我们用不着你了
Huh, then I guess we don't need you.

84
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,080
恰恰相反
On the contrary

85
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,660
擎天柱也许是唯一能击败宇宙大帝的人
Optimus maybe the only one who can defeat Unicron

86
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,420
但能带你们找到他的人 非我莫属
but I remain the only one who can guide you to him.

87
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,740
宇宙大帝的血液在我的体内流淌
Unicron's life blood runs through me

88
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,930
只有我能听到他的思想
only I can hear his thoughts

89
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,370
可以抢先一步采取行动
anticipate his movements.

90
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,380
擎天柱 我们过去的阵营
Optimus, our past alliances--

91
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,750
什么汽车人 霸天虎 都去他的吧
-- Autobot, Decepticon, no longer matter

92
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,170
眼下 宇宙大帝复活了
not while Unicron lives.

93
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,390
过去的事绝不能说算就算！
The past always matters!

94
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,030
汽车人与霸天虎之间的停战协议
A truce between Autobot and Decepticon.

95
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,600
你觉得 我们对它的信任度有多久？
How long do you expect us to believe that will last?

96
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,170
不过是维护共同的利益而已
Only as long is this mutually beneficial.

97
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,010
那么 等到这个共同目标达成之后呢？
And when our proposed to shared mission is complete?

98
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,190
我会征服这个星球…
I will conquer this Earth

99
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,390
用我的方式
my way.

100
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,760
霸天虎也会掏心窝子？
Brutal honesty from a Decepticon?

101
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,490
和小喽罗结盟 同样等于投靠大魔王！
Aligning with the lesser of two evils is still siding with evil.

102
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,470
你们以为自己见识过宇宙大帝的全力吗？
Do you think you've witnessed the full power of Unicron?

103
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,760
那几个步兵连塞牙缝都不够
Those foot soldiers were nothing more than a taste.

104
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,760
宇宙大帝还没有完全苏醒
Unicron has yet to fully awaken.

105
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,690
时间每过一分钟 混沌使者都会愈加强大
With each passing moment, the bringer of chaos evolves

106
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,170
把地球搅得天翻地覆
mutating Earth from the inside out.

107
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,440
我们目前所见的 不过是个序幕
What we have witnessed until now is but a prelude

108
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,430
他的觉醒将给你们的世界带来无尽的浩劫
of the utter devastation his rising will wreak upon your world.

109
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,220
就像你为了追求权力 毁掉塞博特恩那样？
Like your quest for power destroyed Cybertron?

110
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,620
别搞错了
Make no mistake.

111
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,190
这一次 肯定会有一颗星球留给我统治
This time there will be a planet left for me to rule.

112
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,970
即使我们同意
Even if we agree

113
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,570
可宇宙大帝身处在地球的中心
Unicron is all the way down at the center of the Earth.

114
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,700
我们要怎么下去？开车吗？
How are we supposed to get there? Drive?

115
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,920
只有一条路
There is only one way.

116
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,850
绝对不行！
Absolutely not!

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,520
传送到太空 或是行进中的列车上 已经够困难了！
Ground bridging into space or onto moving train is difficult enough

118
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,450
这次居然要漫无目的地传送到 一个智慧生命体内部？
but plotting a blind jump inside of a sentient being?

119
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,200
更何况 直接暴露在那么多的黑暗能量下 会让你们浑身无力
Besides, direct expose to that much Dark Energon will debilitate you.

120
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,240
你们可没有威震天那种免疫力
You haven't built up immunity like Megatron has.

121
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,040
这正是我们联手的另一个好处：
Yet another strong argument for solidarity

122
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,120
我可以当向导
my guidance.

123
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,190
你能提供宇宙大帝精确的坐标吗？
You can provide Unicron's exact coordinates?

124
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,260
如果你能把我们传送到星球的核心
If you transport us to this planet's core

125
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,100
我就能直接带你们找到宇宙大帝的火种
I can lead you directly to Unicron's spark

126
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,420
那可是黑暗力量的心脏！
the very heart of his darkness.

127
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,370
擎天柱 即使我们在传送后能活下来
Optimus, even if we survive the jump

128
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,430
又该怎么阻止宇宙大帝呢？
how are we supposed to stop Unicron?

129
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,800
用领导模块
With the Matrix of Leadership.

130
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,740
那是什么？
What is that?

131
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,310
一个装有纯粹能量的容器
A vessel of pure energy

132
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,610
历届领袖智慧的结晶
the collective wisdom of the Primes.

133
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,210
我们还有寻宝的时间吗？
Do we have time for a scavenger hunt?

134
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,250
我是说 擎天柱该去哪儿找这个“模块”呢？
I mean where is Optimus supposed to find this Matrix?

135
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,760
擎天柱不需要寻找
Optimus does not need to find it.

136
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,840
他一直把它带在身上
He carries it within him.

137
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,820
很久以前 领袖们依靠这种融合的力量 才战胜了宇宙大帝
It was the combined power of the Primes that defeated Unicron so long ago

138
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,260
这也是他现在想要摧毁你的原因
the very reason he now seeks to destroy you.

139
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,490
照这么说 将领导模块的力量 直接灌进宇宙大帝的火种
It would follow that unleashing the power of the Matrix directly into Unicron's spark

140
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,080
就可以让他重新长眠
would return him to stasis.

141
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,840
等等
Hold on.

142
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,400
如果一切都顺利进行的话
If everything goes right

143
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,250
宇宙大帝就会一直待在地下喽？
Unicron's gonna stay down there?

144
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,930
是啊 能不能…想办法把他除掉？
Yeah, can we sent them out somehow?

145
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,320
他不是住在地核里 杰克
He is not in the Earth's core, Jack.

146
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,440
他就是地核
He is the Earth's core.

147
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,790
拉斐尔说的对
Rafael is correct.

148
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,020
扰动地核可能会影响磁极
Tempering with your core could affect the magnetic poles

149
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,590
反而引发一些我们本该避免的特大灾难
trigger the very cataclysmic events we are attempting to remedy.

150
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,390
可惜的是 宇宙大帝正是你们星球的起源
Tragically, Unicron is your planet's very seed

151
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,020
从古至今 直到遥远的将来
always has been and always must be.

152
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,590
又来了一个
We got another one.

153
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,880
救护车 打开环陆桥
Ratchet, set the GroundBridge.

154
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,320
等等 我们就这么打开一条直通基地的大道 让威震天看热闹？
Wait, we're opening up a direct path into our base with Megatron standing right there?

155
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,360
说真的
And seriously

156
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,080
他真能拼了他的火种 给我们擦屁股吗？
he's gonna risk his own spark to save us?

157
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,970
哈哈哈 的确不是我的本性！
Haha... hardly my nature.

158
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,850
考虑一下我的提议
Consider my offer.

159
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,960
我来拖住它
I shall keep it busy.

160
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,790
还没有威震天陛下的消息吗?
No word yet from Lord Megatron?

161
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:28,090
看来统帅弃我们而去了 把我们扔在这个混乱的世界
It appears our leader has abandoned us while this world erupts in chaos.

162
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,100
我认为 我们必须做出长远的打算 无需考虑威震天了
I believe we must consider the possibility of the future without Megatron.

163
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,530
我知道 紧要关头需要采取非常措施
I know the desperate times call for desperate measures

164
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,470
可你真要放威震天进来吗？
but bringing Megatron here?

165
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,200
怎么能让那怪物靠近孩子们 你忘了他差点害死拉夫吗？
How can you even think about letting that monster near these children after what he did to Raf?

166
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,310
我们会严密监视他
He will be closely monitored

167
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,900
并且仅仅让他逗留到带我们上路为止
and only allowed to linger long enough to send us on our journey

168
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,910
一刻也不多留
not one moment more.

169
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,830
那家伙难道不会呼叫空袭吗？反正他知道你的位置
What's gonna stop the Con from calling in air strike could be he knows where you live?

170
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,080
我们用环陆桥带威震天进来
By ground bridging Megatron here

171
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,200
他无法确认我们的具体坐标
he will be unable to get a fix on our coordinates.

172
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,900
擎天柱 到时你会怎么样？我是说 模块能量释放之后
Optimus, what's gonna happen to you when all your... Matrix energy's released?

173
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,670
模块中的力量 从未以这种方式被使用过
The power within the Matrix has not previously been utilized in this particular manner.

174
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,470
但你总该知道个大概 对吧？
But you have an idea, don't you?

175
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
汽车人 为了拯救人类
Autobots, if humankind is to be saved

176
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,990
我没有选择 只能前进
I have no choice but to proceed

177
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,920
但你们可以选
but you do.

178
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,310
其实 我不了解人类
Well, I don't know about humankind

179
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,100
但我愿意这么做
but I'm willing to do it

180
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,630
就为神子
for Miko.

181
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,720
为杰克
For Jack.

182
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,010
威震天 我们这就接你过来
Megatron, we are sending transport.

183
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,610
你始终是个通情达理的人 擎天柱
You can always be relied upon to listen to reason, Optimus.

184
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,330
不公平！我还没见过他呢！
No fair! I've never seen him!

185
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,700
我们干嘛要藏起来？
Why do we have to hide?

186
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,190
因为我说了算
Because I said so.

187
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,380
看来 这就是大变活人的地方
So this is where the magic happens.

188
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,480
古色古香
Quaint.

189
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,380
- 拉夫！
- Raf!\N- Rafael, no!

190
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,800
你！
You!

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,550
啊 你看起来比上次见面时精神多了 小东西
Ah, you're looking much better than the last time we met, little one.

192
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,980
人类啊 真顽强
Humans, resiliant.

193
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,330
来吧 拉夫
Come on Raf.

194
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,760
他不值得你拼命
He isn't worth it.

195
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,990
还有你 我对面孔过目不忘 人类的也算上
And you, I never forget a face even that of a human.

196
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,610
你要是敢骗人
You double-cross anyone

197
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,530
我让你永远忘不了我这张脸 给我记住！
mine is the face you'll never forget, never!

198
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,960
救护车 从我们的客人那里接收目的地坐标
Ratchet, obtain the destination coordinates from our guest.

199
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,210
杰克
Jack

200
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,620
你能帮我保管一样东西吗？
will you keep something for me?

201
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,020
当然
Sure.

202
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,030
这是什么？
What is it?

203
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,000
这是…环陆桥电源的钥匙
It is the key to the GroundBridge power supply.

204
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,220
好吧 可这不该让救护车保管吗？
Ok, but shouldn't Ratchet have this?

205
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,160
或许吧
Perhaps

206
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,830
让我感到欣慰的是 你比我们最初见面时要更加成熟
but I've been impressed by how much you have matured since we first met.

207
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,410
因此
As such

208
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,160
我觉得 你完全可以担当保管这个重要器物的责任
I feel you've earned the responsibility of safeguarding this important device

209
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,150
直到我回来为止
until I return.

210
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,310
我不会让你失望的
I won't let you down.

211
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,340
目标锁定
Locked and ready.

212
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,570
你先
You first.

213
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,040
如你所愿
As you wish.

214
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,650
那个…宇宙大帝何时才会发现我们？
So how long before Unicron knows we're here?

215
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,120
别搞错了
Make no mistake.

216
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,730
他已经知道了
He already does.
