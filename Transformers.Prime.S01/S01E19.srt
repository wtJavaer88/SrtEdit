1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,200
我们本该去看摇滚演唱会的
We're supposed to be at a rock concert

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,650
可我却在这儿…看石头
but all I see is-- rock.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,790
别急 神子
Relax, Miko.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,880
演出还有两个小时才开始呢
The show doesn't start for two hours.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,790
知道我为“歪猴子”乐队等了多久吗？
Do you know how long I've waited to see Slash Monkey?

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,300
呃…
Eh...

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,190
一辈子了！
Forever!

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,940
而且他们只来美国一次！
And it's their only U.S. date!

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,060
居然只来一次
There's a shock.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,790
那个三流保加利亚嚎叫乐队 太不给面子了
I mean, who doesn't love obscure Bulgarian shriek metal?

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,380
从各方面来看 这个矿已经被采空了
By all appearances the mines' been stripped.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,990
可我发现了一个信号
But I'm getting a signal.

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,310
虽然很微弱 但绝对是能量
It's faint, but it's definitely energon.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,050
哇…
Whoa...

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,780
这不合常理
Doesn't make sense.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,920
挖掘行动四五年前就终止了吧？
This operation's been abadoned four, maybe five years?

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,300
霸天虎从不落下一丁点儿能量
And Decepticons never leave energon behind.

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,900
呃 各位？
Eh, guys?

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,010
酷！
Cool!

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,030
她怎么进去了
She went in.

21
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,650
难以置信
Unbelievable.

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,390
真的？你还不了解她吗？
Really? Have you... met her?

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,650
呃 神子 快回来！
Eh, Miko. Get back here!

24
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,940
里面的东西应该挺有趣
It would be kind of interesting to see.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,690
其实应该…
You know, if it were...

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,830
很安全？
Safe?

27
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,240
枯矿的架构很不稳定 杰克
A stripped mine can be structurally unstable, Jack.

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,100
我保证轻拿轻放
I promise to step lightly.

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,930
那就…别告诉你妈
Just... don't tell your mom.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,840
啊 威震天陛下
Ah, Lord Megatron.

31
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,250
我决不是在以下犯上
Far be it from me to question your intentions

32
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,420
但我不明白 我们干嘛要偷偷摸摸地回到这个…老地方？
but I do not understand why we return here after all this time, alone?

33
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,110
我们榨干了矿里的最后一丝能量
Every last trace of energon was extracted from this mine.

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,290
什么都没留下
There is nothing left.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,990
不要多嘴行吗 红蜘蛛？
Indulge me, Starscream, won't you?

36
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,020
神子
Miko!

37
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,370
- 神…
- Mi...

38
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,470
- 看看这里！
- Check it out!

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,600
在这儿排练再好不过了
Now, this would make an awesome rehearsal space.

40
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,660
你好！你好 克利夫兰
Hello! Hello Cleveland.

41
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,320
准备好摇滚了吗？
Are you ready to rock?

42
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,640
喔――哈――哇！
Whoooooohaaaaa... whoa!

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,610
阿尔茜 有发现
Arcee, found something.

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,390
隔板？隔板 你听见了吗？
Bulkhead? Bulkhead, do you read?

45
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,580
见鬼
Scrap.

46
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,590
地下矿藏对信号有干扰
The mineral composition down here is causing interference.

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,510
好吧 音效可能还不够完美
OK, maybe the acoustics aren't perfect.

48
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,920
就是这儿
Over here.

49
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,710
应该给老救带个样本
Ratch's gonna want a sample.

50
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,310
很有趣嘛
How intriguing.

51
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,650
呃…一群笨蛋！
Ehhhh, incompetent fools!

52
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,680
这套挖掘设备早该被调走了
This mining equipment should have been relocated.

53
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,260
怎么还在这儿？
Why is it still here?

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,740
问得好
A most valid question.

55
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,970
我很抱歉 主人
My apologies, master.

56
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,340
我记得负责调度的是声波
I believe Soundwave was in charge of coordinating transport.

57
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,760
不过说句实话
But in fairness

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,650
在您做星际旅行期间 我们都身兼数职
during your inter-stellar travels, we all had to assume additional responsibilities.

59
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,360
难免有些失误
Clearly, mistakes were made.

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,700
是的 难免
Yes, clearly.

61
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,790
这也叫榨干了？
Every last trace of energon extracted?

62
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,770
威震天陛下 我可以解释
Lord Megatron, I can explain.

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,350
解释什么？
Explain what?

64
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,960
解释你为什么私藏能量储备？
That you've been hoarding a supply of energon for your personal use?

65
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,650
不！不能这么说 您说过…
No! Not exactly. You said...

66
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,480
你当我是傻子吗 红蜘蛛？
Do not take me for a fool, Starscream!

67
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,880
我从一开始就知道你在打小算盘
I have been wise to your transgressions from the beginning.

68
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,760
你不但取走我胸口的黑暗能量
Not only did you pluck the Dark Energon from my chest

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,010
试图杀我而未遂
in a failed attempt to snuff my spark

70
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,610
还用它召唤了你自己的不死战士
but you tried to raise your own undead warrior with it.

71
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,830
你为此断臂的事情已经不再是秘密
It's no secret that you lost an arm in the process

72
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,370
尽管你修复得完好如初
which you've since had replaced.

73
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,270
这您都知道？！
You know about that?!

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,090
声波很擅长监视
Soundwave is quite competent in surveillance.

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,460
你大可放心
I can assure you.

76
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,660
事实上 红蜘蛛
The fact is, Starscream

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,750
尽管你在暗中捣鬼
despite your treachery

78
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,940
但我总是睁一只眼 闭一只眼
I've allowed you to carry on this long

79
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,480
因为看着你屡战屡败 也不失为一种乐趣
because I took a certain delight in following your string of failures.

80
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,310
可惜你越来越惹人讨厌 明知故犯
But you finally become tiresome, predictable.

81
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,540
你休想翻身了
You hit rock bottom.

82
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,710
主人 求求您！再给我一次机会！
Master, please! Give me one more chance!

83
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,630
我给您磕头！
I beg of you!

84
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,100
你对我已经毫无用处了 红蜘蛛
You have ceased to be of use to me, Starscream

85
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,510
所以 你就放心地去吧
so you shall simply cease to be.

86
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,150
蹲下！
Stay down!

87
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,540
红蜘蛛！你敢抛下我？
Starscream! You dare abandon me?

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,190
见鬼！
Scrap!

89
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,190
什么？不！
What? No!

90
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,150
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

91
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,700
阿尔茜！
Arcee!

92
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,540
噢 见鬼
Oh, scrap.

93
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,690
是我干的吗？
Did I do that?

94
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,850
我看不像
Don't think so.

95
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,680
你还好吗？
You OK?

96
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,840
好着呢 你呢？
Natch. What about you?

97
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,210
好得不得了…
Peachy...

98
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
喔…
Whoa...

99
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,570
别担心 神子
Don't worry, Miko.

100
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,370
我能顶住
I got it under control.

101
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,370
你知道为什么塌方吗？
What do you think caused the cavein?

102
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,140
天晓得
Who knows.

103
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,430
但愿阿尔茜和杰克都平安 因为…
I just hope Arcee and Jack are safe, 'cause...

104
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,560
我们肯定需要帮手
We can definitely use an assist.

105
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,150
你负责顶天立地 小隔
Just keep raising that roof, Bulk.

106
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,840
我来想办法出去
I'll get us outta here.

107
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,870
哈哈…明知故犯 主人？
Hahahaha... Predictable, master?

108
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,940
你就这么评价我吗？
Is that what you called me?

109
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,580
现在轮到谁翻不了身？
Well, now, who has hit rock bottom?

110
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,820
说什么？对不起
What's that? I'm sorry.

111
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,710
隔着一座五行山 我什么都听不清
I can't hear you beneath all that rubble.

112
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:32,080
哈哈…告辞了 威震天陛下！
Hahahaha... Farewell, Lord Megatron.

113
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,000
愿你一锈到底！
May you rust in peace!

114
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,480
不过 这种遭遇对你来说是小儿科
But you have survived far worse.

115
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,130
如果你自己逃了出来
If you managed to free yourself

116
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,400
就会怪罪我见死不救
you would blame me for your setback.

117
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,490
你发火的时候 我肯定会理亏
And there is no word that I could possibly escape from your wrath.

118
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,760
更不用说
Or worse yet

119
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,900
那些傻瓜随从肯定会来找你
your mindless followers will come looking for you

120
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,240
并因为营救你而立功
and take credit for your rescue.

121
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,370
这个功劳 应该属于我
Credit, that could rightfully be mine.

122
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,200
啊！威震天！
Ah! Megatron!

123
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,830
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

124
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,790
隔板？
Bulkhead?

125
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,430
神子？
Miko?

126
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,750
噢 那东西应该有用
Oh, that could come in handy.

127
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,350
神子
Miko.

128
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,320
我力大无穷
I'm feeling strong.

129
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,020
不 你不行了
No, you're not.

130
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,910
我只需要…休息一会儿…
I just need to... rest for a second.

131
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,130
就够了
That's all.

132
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,710
神子 听我说
Miko, listen to me.

133
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,560
这下面没有新鲜空气
There is no fresh air down here.

134
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,840
如果你消耗氧气太快…
If you use up the oxygen too fast...

135
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,550
我们会窒息！
We could suffocate!

136
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,890
不是我们 神子 是你！
Not we, Miko, you!

137
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,860
汽车人不需要呼吸 你忘了？
Autobots don't need to breathe, remember?

138
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,160
对啊！是从外太空降临的
Right! Smack down in outter space.

139
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,730
太厉害了…
That was cool...

140
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,020
好吧 要不我就…慢一点
OK, what if I just... slow down

141
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,030
减少…呼吸
breathe... less.

142
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,160
不 你必须立即住手
No. You need to stop, now.

143
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,530
不行 小隔
I can't, Bulk.

144
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,000
我必须救你出去
I have to get you out of here.

145
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,780
神子 拜托 别担心我
Miko, please, don't worry about me.

146
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,870
我很好
I'm fine.

147
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,800
出发
Roll out.

148
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,570
你听到了吗？
Do you hear that?

149
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,650
听起来像…
Sounds like...

150
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,530
钻探机
Drilling.

151
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,370
一定是阿尔茜和杰克
Got to be Arcee and Jack.

152
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,370
我们在…这儿！
We are in... here!

153
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,370
这儿…
Here...

154
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,500
神子 找个东西 砸我的脚
Miko, grab something, and bang it on my foot.

155
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,810
你能行吗？
Can you do that?

156
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,610
我不想伤着你
I don't want to hurt you.

157
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,860
我不是吹牛
I know it's hard to believe

158
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,640
我可是超级结实
but I'm tougher than I look.

159
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,190
用尽全力砸
Give it all you got.

160
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,250
我猜…
I suppose

161
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,430
帮助倒霉鬼脱困 是你最不想做的事
helping those less fortunate would be completely out of the question.

162
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,100
如果真的是那样
If that is the case

163
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,060
你可以用钻头把我杀掉
you might as well use your drill to finish me.

164
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:29,400
我保证 你以后再也不会有这么好的机会了
I guarantee you will never have a better opportunity than right now.

165
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,150
好了 你还等什么？
Well, what are you waiting for?

166
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,590
这是莫大的荣耀 机不可失！
Think of the glory--seize the day!

167
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,440
擎天柱会趁机动手的
Optimus would.

168
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,460
不 他不会
No, he wouldn't.

169
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,120
这是乘人之危
Not like this.

170
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,170
我一定会把今天的对话内容 一五一十告诉擎天柱――
I will be sure to share the details of our little conversation with Optimus--

171
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,090
然后扯出他的火种！
the day I rip out his spark!

172
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,950
好姑娘
That a girl.

173
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,980
刚才什么声音？
What was that?

174
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,880
没什么
Nothing.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,820
来吧 继续砸
Go on, keep banging.

176
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,560
隔板 怎么回事？告诉我！
Bulkhead, what's happening? Tell me!

177
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,970
我的手臂…快撑不住了…
My arms... they're starting to give...

178
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,450
疼吗？
Does it hurt?

179
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,760
有点
A little.

180
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,280
隔板！
Bulkhead!

181
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,320
帮手来了
Help's coming.

182
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,950
我们得把他们引过来
We just got to guide them here.

183
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,380
再砸一次！
Hit me again!

184
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,850
神子 动手！
Miko, do it!

185
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,120
他们靠近了吗？
Are they any closer?

186
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,740
我听不出来
I can't tell.

187
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,150
这里的回声…
The sound is all...

188
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,510
太难听了！
freaky in here!

189
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,210
哈哈…太好了！
Hahaha, yes!

190
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,610
阿尔茜找到我们了！
Arcee found us!

191
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,100
哈哈哈…不要再质疑我的忠诚了…
Hahahaha... Put any doubt of my allegiance to rest.

192
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,350
他来干嘛？
What's he doing down here?

193
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,280
神子 躲到我身后 快！
Miko, get behind me, now!

194
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,780
哎呀呀 这不是隔板和他的宠物小臭虫嘛
Well, well, if it isn't Bulkhead and his pet vermin.

195
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,580
哎哟 看来你腾不出手了 是吧 汽车人？
My, you do have your hands full, don't you, Autobot?

196
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,550
要打就冲我来 红蜘蛛
Do whatever you want to me, Starscream.

197
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,330
先放人类走！
But let the human go!

198
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,860
不 我不离开你
No. I'm not leaving you.

199
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,980
看来 这个人类想留下
It appears that the human wishes to remain.

200
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,060
红蜘蛛 别逼我
Starscream, don't push me.

201
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,920
你喜欢跟大机器人一起玩 对不对 小姑娘？
You like playing with the big robots, don't you, little girl?

202
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,200
够了 汽车人！
That's it, Autobot!

203
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,030
我要…
I will...

204
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,980
什么？你要干什么？
What? You'll what?

205
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,080
让这块巨石砸到我们俩头上吗？
Maybe bring down the ceiling on top of all of us?

206
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,820
快跑 神子！
Run, Miko!

207
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,160
没错 跑吧 神子
Yes, run, Miko.

208
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,130
我想看看你如何逃命
I would love to see you try.

209
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,540
说真的 我想看看
Really, I would.

210
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,800
啊！
Ah!

211
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,140
杰克 带神子离开这儿 快！
Jack, get Miko out of here, now!

212
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,680
上来 上来！
Come on, come on!

213
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,690
快跑 神子！
Run, Miko!

214
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,370
我们不能丢下隔板！
We can't leave Bulkhead!

215
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,290
杀两个 赚一双
And then there were two.

216
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,480
阿尔茜会来救他的 对吗？
Arcee will save him, won't she?

217
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,730
趁威震天爬出来之前 我们俩得想办法逃出去
You and I just need to find a way out of here before Megatron digs himself free.

218
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,230
威震天也来了？
Megatron's here, too?

219
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,460
以为我会求饶吗 红蜘蛛
If you think I'm gonna beg for mercy, Starscream

220
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,830
省省吧！
forget it!

221
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,170
是啊 跪地求饶太丢脸了 不是吗？
Er, yes, begging for mercy would be quite pathetic, wouldn't it?

222
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,630
不过 把你活捉 我就立大功了
Well, you're much more valuable to me alive.

223
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,950
威震天该对我刮目相看 我不光救了他
Imagine Megatron's appreciation when I not only rescue him

224
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,530
还抓了个汽车人
but deliver a Autobot.

225
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,730
那样一来 我就可以重振雄风了
I believe that would restore my statue quite nicely.

226
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,910
别动 红蜘蛛
Don't move, Starscream.

227
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,320
嘿 小隔
Hey, Bulk.

228
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,120
嘿 小茜
Hey, Cee.

229
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,940
举起手来
Raise your hands.

230
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,040
噢…
Oh...

231
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,950
我们可以就地解决他
We could finish him, here and now.

232
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,510
可惜我没带手雷
Shame I didn't bring any grenades.

233
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,190
如果换成擎天柱 会下手吗？
Would Optimus finish them?

234
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,500
不 他多半不会
No, he probably wouldn't.

235
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,100
这是乘人之危
Not like this.

236
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,790
但擎天柱也不会救他们的 对吧？
But Optimus wouldn't rescue them, either. Right?

237
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,020
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

238
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,560
主人 您还活着！
Master. You are alive!

239
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,910
感谢火种源！
Thank the Allspark!

240
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,740
我没有抛下您 主人
I did not abandon you, master.

241
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,090
我回来…是要救您！
I returned... to save you!

242
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,810
救我？
Save me?

243
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,410
火种可鉴 威震天陛下
Look into my spark, Lord Megatron.

244
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,410
我是真心的！
My intentions were true.

245
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,120
求求您 发发慈悲吧！
Please, have mercy!
