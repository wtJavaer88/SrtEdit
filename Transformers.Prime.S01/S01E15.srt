1
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,120
睡得舒服吗 红蜘蛛？
Resting comfortably, Starscream?

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,610
尽管你伤得不轻
Despite the extend of your injuries

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,410
但我的医务兵向我保证 你很快就能康复
my medical staff assures me that you shall make a rapid recovery.

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,950
但愿您也快点消去心头的怒火
Hopefully, every bit as rapid as your wrath is swift.

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,290
真是世事难料啊
Hahahahahaha... and how swiftly things change?

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,270
想想看 不久之前
To think that but a short time ago

7
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,210
还是你站在这里 而我躺在那里
it was you who were standing here while I was lying there

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,490
可惜你棋差一着 没能置我于死地！
right after your failed attempt to terminate me.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,670
不过你记好了 亲爱的红蜘蛛：
But know this, dear Starscream:

10
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,310
你再也休想翻身上位
our position shall never again be reversed.

11
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,910
红蜘蛛 你失去理智了吗？
Starscream, have you lost your senses?

12
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,690
你还没完全康复呢！
You haven't fully recuperated.

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,010
我感觉很好 击倒 再好不过了！
I feel fine, Knock Out, never better!

14
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,460
你真是神医啊 现在给我滚开！
You are a brilliant physician. Now get out of my way!

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,780
啊…黑暗能量让你恢复了力量 主人
Ahhh... Dark Energon may have replenished your strength, master.

16
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,090
但你难道忘了吗？\N你还没有拿回 你原本的那块碎片
But how could you forget, that you never reclaimed your original shard?

17
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,060
宇宙大帝之血流入我的血脉之日
Once the blood of Unicron flows through my veins

18
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,150
就是我翻身上位之时！
our positions shall be reversed.

19
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,380
原以为我对这种东西的了解 仅限于学术方面
I had hoped that my growing expertise on the subject would remain purely academic

20
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,000
但这个微弱的信号 显然又是一股黑暗能量
but though faint, this is clearly a Dark Energon signature

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,660
而且移动迅速
and it's moving fast.

22
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,670
是威震天
Megatron.

23
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,730
他又从哪儿找到了那东西？
Where did he find more the bad stuff?

24
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,690
他用那能量要干嘛？组建新的丧尸大军吗？
What's he gonna do with it? Recruiting new army of the undead?

25
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,330
僵尸虎？
Zombie-cons?

26
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,800
不能排除这种可能性
We cannot rule out the possibility

27
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,260
特别是 威震天似乎要去一个老地方
especially since Megatron seems to be heading to a familiar site.

28
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,400
啊 强大的天震葬身于此
Ah, the grave site of the mighty Skyquake.

29
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,710
生前你不假思索地拒绝我的领导
So quick to reject my authority while you lived

30
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,030
但作为被我复活的第一名战士
but as the first of my reanimated warriors

31
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,420
你应该听我号令！
you shall bow to my command!

32
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,200
是的…黑暗能量之力…是我的了！
Yesss... power of Dark Energon... be mine!

33
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:15,450
啊…融为一体 哈哈哈…我感觉到了！
Ahhh.... symbiosis... hahahahaha... I can feel it!

34
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,090
威震天刚从休眠中醒来不久
Megatron has barely emerged from stasis

35
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,470
看来他迫不及待要弥补损失的时间
and it seems he's already making up for lost time.

36
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,140
隔板 大黄蜂 救护车 准备出发
Bulkhead, Bumblebee, Ratchet, prepare to roll out.

37
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,390
我也去？
Me?

38
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,740
如果要对付的是黑暗能量
If we are dealing with Dark Energon

39
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,660
我可能需要你的专业知识
I may well require your expertise.

40
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,540
阿尔茜…
Arcee...

41
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,620
当环陆桥操作员 明白！
Bridge operator, got it!

42
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,580
干掉他 隔板 把心脏带回来
Go get'em, Bulkhead. Bring the heart.

43
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,300
无动于衷 这可不是神子的风格
That's not like Miko not wanna go.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,590
她肯定在打什么鬼主意
She's definitely up to something.

45
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
快拦住她！
Make it a break!

46
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,040
那不安全！
It's not safe.

47
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,540
第一次参加僵尸虎大战 我决不能错过！
I'm not gonna miss my first zombie-cons' throwdown!

48
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,030
神子？
Miko?

49
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,390
那不是威震天！
That's not Megatron!

50
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,310
起来吧 天震！站起来！
Rise, Skyquake! Rise!

51
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,690
快来观赏活死人的战斗吧！
Let's see some fight of the living dead already!

52
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,850
神子 你在想什么？
Miko? What were you thinking?

53
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,350
她什么都没想
She wasn't.

54
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,740
嘿 上次我完全错过了
Hey, I totally missed out last time.

55
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,580
这次也许是惟一的机会 能抓拍几张照片
This could be my only chance to take some snaps.

56
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,800
我的手机 肯定是落在基地了
My cellphone. I must have dropped it back at base.

57
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,890
红蜘蛛！
Starscream.

58
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,370
汽车人？
Autobots?

59
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,470
投降吧！
Stand down.

60
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,480
要投降的是你！
You stand down.

61
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,620
你伤不了我\N黑暗能量已经流遍了我的经脉！
You cannot harm me while Dark Energon flows through my veins!

62
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,980
你打断了他的翅膀 他飞不起来了
You clipped his wing. He's grounded.

63
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,170
快啊 快啊 快站起来！
Come on, come on, rise already!

64
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,450
我是红蜘蛛指挥官
This is Commander Starscream

65
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,730
请向我的坐标紧急开启环陆桥
requesting emergency Ground Bridge to my coordinates.

66
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,750
真不敢相信 你害我丢了手机！
Ugrrr... I can't believe you make me lose my phone!

67
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,080
怎么成我的错了？
Eheh, how was this my fault?

68
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,060
噢 不
Oh, no.

69
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,380
基地呼叫擎天柱 孩子们不见了
Base to Optimus, the kids are missing.

70
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,390
我们已经看到了 立即打开环陆桥
We have a visual, send the GroundBridge immediately.

71
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,570
两个？你们三个！进我们的环陆桥 快！
Two? You three! Into our Ground Bridge, now!

72
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,040
走吧！
Come on！

73
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,360
救护车 怎么回事？
Ratchet, what is happening?

74
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,050
双重环陆桥的传送门之间 一定是产生了反馈
The dualing GroundBridge portals must be feeding back on each other.

75
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,440
神子…我们得把孩子们救出来
Miko... we gotta get the kids out of there.

76
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,450
我的手！
My arm!

77
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,160
不准提起这件事！谁都别说！
Not a word about this! To anyone!

78
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,650
你们没事吧？
Are you guys OK?

79
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,890
是的 我想没事
Yea, I think so.

80
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,030
刚…刚才是怎么了？
What.. what just happened?

81
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,120
我不敢肯定
I can't be certain

82
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,210
但如果同一坐标的两座环陆桥形成对流
but if two GroundBridges sent to the same coordinates crossed streams

83
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,980
反馈效应可能会引起系统超载
the feedback could have triggered the system overload.

84
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,660
可能？嘿 那简直是肯定的！
Could? Hello? More like totally did!

85
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,400
孩子们顺利通过了吧？
The kids made it through, right?

86
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,180
他这话什么意思？
What's he talking about?

87
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,360
隔板 我们在这儿呢！
Bulkhead, we are right here!

88
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,190
阿尔茜 孩子们安全回到基地了吗？
Arcee, did the children make it safely back to base?

89
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,820
没有 你们没看到他们吗？
Negative. You don't see them?

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,040
毫无踪影
No sign.

91
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,220
什么？毫无踪影？
What? No sign?

92
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,320
好吧 别闹了 小隔
OK, seriously Bulk?

93
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,720
哇！
Woaaah!

94
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,470
他从你身上穿了过去…
He went right through you.

95
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,840
我们不是活人！
We are not alive!

96
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,620
我不想变成鬼魂！
I don't wanna be a ghost!

97
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,350
等等 为什么我们之间能碰到？
Wait, how can we still touch each other?

98
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,250
救护车 孩子们有可能被
Ratchet, could the children have been

99
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,640
传送到报应号内部吗？
transported on to the Nemisis instead?

100
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,180
不大可能 既然红蜘蛛没有进入我们的基地
Not likely, if Starscream didn't arrive at our base.

101
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,990
最合理的解释就是定位混乱
The most likely explanation is a dislocation.

102
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,160
孩子们可能只是被传送到 一个随机的地点
The children may simply have been bridged to an unintended destination.

103
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,900
既不是这里 又正是这里？
Another place but in the same place?

104
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,290
你…你什么意思？
Wh... what do you mean?

105
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,010
我们很可能在另一个四维空间
We're probably in a different dimension.

106
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,510
另一种现实 一个暗影空间
Some kind of alternate reality, a shadowzone.

107
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,170
书呆子又来了
Nerd alert.

108
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,510
看 天震的墓空了
Look, Skyquake's tomb is empty.

109
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,400
天震死而复生 我们怎么会没发现？
How do we miss Skyquake rising and shining?

110
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,240
看来红蜘蛛得偿所愿了
It would seem Starscream got what he came for.

111
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,800
以后再考虑这个问题
Another matter for another time.

112
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,210
目前 我们的首要任务是找到杰克 神子和拉斐尔
Right now, our priority is locating Jack, Miko and Raphael.

113
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,290
阿尔茜 传送我们回基地
Arcee, bridge us back to base.

114
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,470
僵尸！
Zombie!

115
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,930
伙计们 小心！
Guys, look out!

116
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,570
隔板！
Bulkhead!

117
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,460
它就在你们后面！
It's right behind you!

118
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,640
太好了！连它也碰不到他们
Awesome! It can't touch them either.

119
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,690
如果那东西碰不到汽车人…
If that thing can't touch the Bots...

120
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,380
就跟我们一样
Just like we can't...

121
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,120
那么和我们一起被困在暗影空间的 就是个霸天虎僵尸！
Then we are trapped in a shadowzone, with a Decepticon zombie!

122
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,730
就算我们现在没死 变鬼魂也是迟早的事
If we aren't ghosts now, we will be soon.

123
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:51,940
快！
Come on!

124
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,230
杰克 我的眼镜！
Jack, my glasses!

125
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,650
太危险了
Way too dangerous.

126
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,250
没有眼镜 我什么都看不见
I can't see without them.

127
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,200
你怎么 七老八十了吗？
What are you, ninety？

128
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,390
别说风凉话！
Not helping!

129
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,360
好吧！
Fine!

130
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,530
等等！
Wait!

131
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,630
拿去吧 小老头 快跑
Here you go, gramps. Let's book.

132
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,190
也许能设一个陷阱 想办法砸坏它！
Maybe we could set up a trap, trying to crash it!

133
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,770
用什么砸？除了地上的尘土 这儿根本没有实物
With what? Nothing around here is solid except dusts on the ground.

134
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,390
我们不能一直逃下去 但或许能藏起来
We can't run forever. But maybe we can hide.

135
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,810
救护车 如果孩子们被误传到了未指定的地点
Ratchet, if the children were misdirected to an unintended location

136
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,360
有没有办法可以锁定他们的位置？
is there anyway to get a fix on their coordinates.

137
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,280
如果他们迷路了 神子应该会打电话给我的
If they were lost, Miko would have called me by now.

138
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,380
打给他们？没错！
Call them? Yes!

139
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,700
难怪神子没有打电话
That's why Miko hasn't phoned.

140
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,870
我试试打给杰克
Let me try Jack.

141
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,950
僵尸最好的一点就是 他们很慢 像爬一样
The best thing about zombies-- they are slow-moving.

142
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,810
- 是你的…\N- 电话！
Is that your...

143
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,170
喂 阿尔茜？
Hello, Arcee?

144
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,610
杰克 听见了吗？
Jack, can you hear me?

145
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,940
没声音
Nothing.

146
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,390
喂 阿尔茜？唉 没声音
Hello, Arcee? Uh, nothing.

147
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,040
天哪 谁想得到
Gee, imagine that

148
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,110
四维空间的手机信号这么差
the forth dimension has lausy cellphone reception.

149
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,610
嘿 伙计们…电话响了
Hey guys, guys, guys, the phone rang.

150
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,170
说明有信号
We are getting a signal.

151
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,890
汽车人看不见也听不见我们 可能是因为…
Maybe the Autobots can't see or hear us because...

152
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,740
我们也许在做超高速运动
we are moving at hyper speed or something.

153
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,350
你觉得他们能收到我们的信息吗？
Do you think that they could read us?

154
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
短信！
Texting!

155
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,420
给我发短信！如果我的手机在基地 他们或许能看到！
Text me! If my phone is back at base, maybe they'll see it!

156
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,280
呃…你能边跑边发吗？
Uh... can you type and run?

157
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,070
我们要在一大片扭曲力场中识别波动能量
We are dealling with fluctuating energy profiles inside a wide distortion field

158
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,040
不过 也许可以反向追踪到他们的坐标
but it may be possible to back-trace their coordinates.

159
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,910
似曾相识
Déjà vu

160
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,000
什么？
What?

161
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,090
你不觉得这里看起来很眼熟吗？
This doesn't look familiar to you?

162
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,500
不觉得
Not really.

163
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,300
老兄 我们只是在绕圈子！
Dude, we just ran one big circle!

164
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,590
太棒了！
Sweet!

165
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,400
它一定也是在爆炸时被困在这儿的
It must have gone trapped in here during the explosion, too.

166
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,220
既然这是个真家伙 我们就能用
Well, if it's solid, we can use it.

167
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,400
呃 红蜘蛛 我想不通 这是怎么搞的
Uh, Starscream, I don't quite understand how this could have happened.

168
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,370
不通也得通！
And yet, it did!

169
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,920
你能想象我有多惊慌吗？
Can you imagine my horror?

170
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,160
当时我在想事情 我的手臂突然自己掉了！
There I am, minding my own business, when my arm just falls off!

171
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,810
显然 威震天对我造成的伤害 不是你想的那么简单！
Clearly Megatron inflicted more damage upon me than you realize!

172
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,010
医生…
Doctor...

173
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,600
这样吧 想开点
Well, on the bright side

174
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,870
这正是个升级的绝好机会
this provides an excellent opportunity for an upgrade.

175
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,750
唔…我看看 你可以试试这个声波炮
Uh.. let's see, you could go with this sonic cannon.

176
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,440
很稳定 维护简单 只是不大气派
It's reliable, low maintenance, although it lacks of certain flare.

177
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,990
我个人推荐氖射线
Personally I prefer the null-ray.

178
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,960
闪光和火力的搭配恰到好处
It has just the right mix of flash and fire power.

179
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,650
我不想换新设备！
I don't want a new model!

180
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,670
我只想让我的手臂完好如初！
I just want the same arm I had before!

181
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,590
但是红蜘蛛 你的装备有点…过时了
But Starscream, your equipment is a bit... obsolete...

182
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,190
不知道还有没有废旧的备用品
I'm not sure I have another one lying around.

183
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,980
当然了 也可以尝试用原肢修复――原肢你还留着吧？
Of course we could try to salvage yours-- you kept it, didn't you?

184
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,360
已经…无法修复了
It was beyond recovery.

185
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,700
谁知道怎么发射这玩意儿？
Anyone know how to fire this thing?

186
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,430
我没看到扳机
I don't see a trigger.

187
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,610
红蜘蛛似乎是通过手指来操作的
Starscream did something with his fingers.

188
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,930
只能发射一次 要一击命中
We have one shot. We need to make it count.

189
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,110
还敢惹我们吗？
How do you like us now?

190
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,850
快 快！
Come on, come on!

191
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,100
为什么僵尸的手 比它本身跑得还快？
How can a zombie arm move faster than the actual zombie?

192
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,270
神子的电话
Miko's phone.

193
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,070
刚才它没闪过
It wan't blinking before.

194
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,950
是条信息
It's a message.

195
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,080
“与僵尸同被困在另一个空间 救命！”
"In alternate dimension with zombie. Help!"

196
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,360
听起来很离谱
That doesn't sound possible.

197
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
救护车 能确定手机信号的地理位置吗？
Ratchet, can we triangulate the geographical position

198
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,230
在平行四维空间里？
In a parallel dimensional plane?

199
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,560
我们试试看
Let's find out.

200
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,430
我的黑暗能量碎片
My Dark Energon shard.

201
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,130
有脉冲？我的战士还活着！
Pulsing? My warrior lives!

202
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,410
啊…看看我在仓库找到了什么
Ahh... Look what I found in storage.

203
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,920
你又干什么去？！
What are you doing?

204
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,290
你说的没错 击倒
You were right, Knock Out.

205
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,560
我跟原来的零件太有感情了
I'm much too attached to my original appendage.

206
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,890
我会找回来的
I will retrieve it.

207
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,440
通过计算相对时差和球面畸变数据
Now, calculating for relative time delays and iron spheric distortions

208
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,500
信号的发射源地点
the signal eminated from the exact location

209
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,290
和之前的环陆桥坐标完全相同！
as the original GroundBridge coordinates!

210
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,330
但我们在那儿找过了
But we already looked for them there.

211
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:34,210
虽然找过 但却找错了空间 如他们的短信所说
Perhaps, but not in the correct dimensional phase as their message stated.

212
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,270
不过 如果我重新启动引发事故的那个反馈循环
But, if I can recreate the feedback loop which triggered the event

213
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,430
应该能生成一个营救传送门
I might be able to generate a rescue portal

214
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,940
从他们所在的空间…
allowing passage from their dimension...

215
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
传送回基地？
Back to base?

216
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,580
不！这可是跨空间传送 隔板！
No! We are talking about inter-dimensional travel here, Bulkhead!

217
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,790
将漩涡轨道重新定向 风险太大！
Attempting to redirect the vortex trajectory would be far too risky.

218
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,260
大家都明白
Everyone knows that.

219
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,790
如果坐标不是绝对一致
If the coordinates aren't precisely the same

220
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,360
他们会被传送到哪儿 谁都不知道！
who knows where the humans could wind up?

221
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,020
噢 拜托！
Oh, come on!

222
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,850
这地方就像个大型旋转木马
This place is like one big merry-go-round.

223
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,580
天震？你的主人在召唤你！
Skyquake? You master summons you!

224
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,210
那个怪胎怎么跑进了我们的空间？
How'd that freak get into our dimension?

225
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,640
他没进来 他看不见我们
He didn't. He can't see us.

226
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,140
别管红蜘蛛了 我们得继续跑！
Forget Starscream, we get to run...

227
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,310
再跑一圈…
some more.

228
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,710
环陆桥传送门？
A GroundBridge portal?

229
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,500
一定是出口！
That has to be a way out of here.

230
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,490
汽车人看到我们的信息了
The Autobots saw our texts.

231
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,980
什么？我的？还是他们的？
What? Mine? Or theirs?

232
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,450
如果我们穿过去 一定会跟红蜘蛛碰面
If we go through, we will smack into Starscream.

233
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,620
如果我们不过去…
If we don't...

234
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,320
就变成僵尸的盘中餐
We are zombie chow.

235
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,850
还有第三个选择 继续绕圈跑
Option 3, we get running in circles.

236
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,960
听我口令
Follow my lead.

237
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,810
跑！
Now!

238
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,840
人类？你们这堆虫子从哪儿…
Humans? Where did you vermin...

239
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,240
不！
No!

240
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:22,630
这不是我的手…啊…
This isn't mine... ah... Unhand me!

241
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,650
杰克 神子 拉斐尔
Jack, Miko, Raphael.

242
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,310
啊 又是汽车人？
Ah, Autobots again?

243
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,570
请求开启紧急环陆桥 快！
Requesting emergency GroundBridge, now!

244
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,800
听着 如果要责备谁的话 就拿我开刀吧
Look, if you are gonna blame anybody, blame me.

245
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,530
不好意思 你能重说几十遍吗？
I'm sorry, could you repeat that a couple of dozen times?

246
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,700
神子 你的经历算是给你足够的教训了
Miko, what you endured has been lesson enough.

247
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,320
你们安然无恙 我们就放心了
We are just glad you are all safe.

248
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,340
幸好你落下了这个
Guess it was a good thing you dropped this.

249
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,860
可惜你一张照片都没拍到
Too bad you didn't get any pictures though.

250
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,350
算了 没什么
Nah, that's OK.

251
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,390
我想 从今以后
I think after today

252
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,280
僵尸的特写镜头 已经深深烙在我脑子里了
I pretty much have zombie close-up seared into my brain.

253
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,240
怎么回事？威震天又把你当破铜烂铁砸了一遍？
What happened? Megatron pound you like scrap metal again?

254
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,810
我不想提了
I would rather not discuss it.

255
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,730
老实说 红蜘蛛 你得善待自己一点
Honestly Starscream, you need to take better care of yourself.

256
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,270
你没捡回你的手臂吗？
Didn't you retrieve your limb?
