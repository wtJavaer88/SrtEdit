1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,010
好了！家务做完了
All right! Chores are done.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,170
现在能去玩沙丘赛车吗？
Now can we do some dune bashing?

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,740
我没想好 神子
I don't know, Miko.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,200
上次我花了一个星期去清理发声器里的沙子
Last time I spent a week picking sand out of my articulators.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,500
不过市里有个大脚车拉力赛…
But there is a monster truck rally in town...

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,250
擎天柱 我收到一个来自秘密波段的信号
Optimus, I'm receiving a signal of our restricted band.

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,760
好像来自一艘宇宙飞船 就在这个太阳系内
It appears to be coming from a starship inside the solar system.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,320
是一个汽车人的标识信号
It's an Autobot identification beacon.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,210
还有其他的汽车人吗？
So there are other bots out there?

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,780
塞博特恩陷入死寂的时候 很多人都流落到太空
The masses scattered to the galaxies when Cybertron finally went dark.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,290
不过 虎子们经常用假信号当作诱饵
But, cons have been known to bait traps with false beacons.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,550
不明飞船 这是汽车人前哨基地欧米加1号
Unknown vessel, this is Autobot outpost Omega One.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,850
表明你的身份
Identify yourself.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,820
霸天虎作战部队的欢迎仪式 可比这热闹多了
I've had warmer welcomes from Decepticon combat brigades.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,190
千斤顶？
Wheeljack?

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,520
你这打虎子老手！
You old Con-crusher!

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,050
你大老远跑这儿来干嘛？
What do you do all the way out here?

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,050
隔板？是你！
Bulkhead? That's you!

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,850
怎么那么多的安全措施？
What's with all the security?

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,850
我们住的这块大石头上爬满了虎子们
The rock we are on is crawling with Cons.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,780
你什么时候过来？我们正缺人手
How soon can you get here and even the odds?

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,780
明天的某个时刻 但我得踩踩油门
Sometime tomorrow, but put metal to the pedal.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,640
又来了个汽车人？
Another bot's coming here?

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,090
这可太酷了！
How cool is that?

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,830
千斤顶…
Wheeljack

26
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,620
我只听说过他的大名
I know of him by reputation only.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,000
你确认是他的声纹吗？
Can you verify his voiceprint?

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,830
百分之一千是他 擎天柱
He is one thousand percent the real deal, Optimus.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,940
我们会提供着陆坐标 千斤顶
We will send landing coordinate, Wheeljack.

30
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,350
祝旅途平安
Safe journey.

31
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,490
到时候见 哥们儿
See you soon buddy.

32
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,190
我给你准备个隆重的欢迎仪式
I'll make sure you get a proper welcome.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,940
你这朋友什么来头？
So who is the boyfriend?

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,960
我和老千是老相识了
Haha, me and Jackie go way back.

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,730
我们曾经并肩战斗在…
We were part of the same war unit C

36
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,130
雷霆救援队
C the Wreckers

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,790
虎子们碰上我们 只能有来无回！
which means the cons are gonna wish he never found us.

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,070
“千斤顶？你大老远跑这儿来干嘛？”
"Wheeljack? What do you do all the way out here?"

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,020
“隔板？是你！”
"Bulkhead? That's you."

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,980
“怎么那么多的安全措施？”
"What's with all the security."

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,260
“我们住的这块大石头上爬满了虎子们”
"The rock we are on is crawling with Cons."

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,410
来了个战斗英雄 嗯？
A war hero, mh?

43
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,550
我们要抓紧时间
We haven't much time.

44
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,800
千面客！
Makeshift!

45
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,520
“住的这块大石头上爬满了虎子们”
"The rock we are on is crawling with Cons."

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,820
“你什么时候过来？我们正缺人手”
"How soon can you get here and even the odds?"

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,790
“明天的某个时刻 但我得踩踩油门”
"Sometime tomorrow, but put metal to the pedal."

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,810
“到时候见 哥们”
"See you soon buddy."

49
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,910
“我给你准备个隆重的欢迎仪式”
"I'll make sure you get a proper welcome."

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,950
我也会准备一个隆重的欢迎仪式
I do know how to prepare and proper welcome.

51
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,170
千斤顶的飞船正接近着陆区
Wheeljack ship is approaching the landing zone.

52
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,750
他只是碰巧路过吗？
You think he’s here to visit?

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,820
说不定会留下来呢！
Maybe he'll stay!

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,860
嗯 但得给他找个人类同伴
Hmm, have to find his own human though.

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,870
环陆桥开始运行
Ground Bridge cycling up.

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,240
都怪该死的吸屑虫！
Uh, blast to the Scrapblets.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,950
自从上次被侵蚀后 设备便大不如前了
The equipment hasn't been the same since the infestation.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,660
就是说 千斤顶将在地球的另一面着陆
So Wheeljack is gonna land half way around the world

59
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,290
然后你再把他接过来？
and then you'll bridge him here?

60
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,590
我们基地的位置要保密 不能冒险
We can't risk revealing the location of our base

61
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,380
这是为防止霸天虎跟踪千斤顶的飞船
just in case the Decepticons are tracking Wheeljack's ship.

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,130
哥们 我从没见过你这么兴奋
Dude, I've never seen you so stoked.

63
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,650
噢 你会喜欢上千斤顶的
Ho, you're gonna love Wheeljack.

64
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,970
我们亲如手足！
We were like brothers!

65
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,530
今晚我们要好好乐乐！
And tonight, we are gonna party!

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,080
好棒啊！
S-weet!

67
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,010
麻烦来了
Bogies

68
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,930
正向千斤顶的方位迅速接近
closing fast on Wheeljack's position.

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,400
这群虎崽子！
Con-scum!

70
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,520
如果你们想扫我的雅兴
If you are trying to ruin my day

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,850
可得加把劲了
you are gonna have to try harder.

72
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,580
一群温顺的小猫
You Cons have gone soft on me.

73
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,020
快点 要赶在汽车人到达之前！
Swiftly, before the Autobots arrive!

74
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,510
把桥打开 救护车 我们要错过好戏了！
Open the bridge, Ratchet. We're missing all the action.

75
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,640
我去准备医疗舱
I’ll prepare sig-bay.

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,030
给谁准备？虎子们？
Hehe, who for? The Cons?

77
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,430
他可是响当当的千斤顶啊
This is Wheeljack we are talking about.

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,100
我没说错吧
Hehe, I told about it.

79
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,670
以为我会需要增援吗？
Ever think I might need a hand here?

80
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,240
啥？去糟蹋一场好戏？
What? And spoil the show?

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,330
你漏了一个
You missed one.

82
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,500
如果你们就这么几个人
If this is all you get

83
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,040
这星球的情况可比我想像得要糟
the planet is in bigger trouble than I thought.

84
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,710
老千！
Jackie! Hahahahaha...

85
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,720
有完没完啊 你个流星锤？
Haha, watch the finish, you old racking ball.

86
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,440
老千 过来
Jacky, come here.

87
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,030
这是我另一个死党 神子！
Meet my other best buddy, Miko!

88
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,190
她的实力跟咱俩不相上下
She can wreck with a best of us.

89
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,620
你好
Hi ya.

90
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,250
你好好看着隔板 别让他找麻烦
You keeping Bulkhead out of trouble?

91
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,600
我会的
I try.

92
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,370
但麻烦总是主动找上门来
But trouble finds us anyway.

93
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,480
我们会相处融洽的
We are gonna get along just fine.

94
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,020
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,820
久仰大名
It's a privilege.

96
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,590
彼此彼此 战士
Likewise, soldier.

97
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,540
你远道而来 有什么发现？
What have you to report from you long journey?

98
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
从一个星球到另一个星球
Been bouncing from rock to rock

99
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,220
寻找朋友和敌人而已
searching for signs of friend or foe.

100
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,420
现在 两样都找到了
Now, I find both.

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,950
我们人少 但都是精锐
We are few, but strong.

102
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,620
我们失去过同伴
We have suffered losses

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,820
但也得到了教训
but we have grown.

104
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,960
我们也非常欢迎新成员的加入
And we would relish welcome in a new member into our fold.

105
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,140
我感到荣幸
I would be honored.

106
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,990
那就开始狂欢吧！
Then let's get this party started!

107
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,200
真是乐疯了
Oh, joy!

108
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,190
千面客穿过环陆桥的那一刻
The moment Makeshift passed through that Ground Bridge

109
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,890
我们就失去了他的追踪信号
we lost his tracking signal.

110
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,570
汽车人基地看来的确守卫森严
The Autobot base is no doubt heavily shielded to

111
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,770
我们难以摸清它的位置
prevent us from locating it.

112
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,920
不过 没关系
No matter

113
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,850
我对千面客有绝对的信心
I have complete faith in Makeshift.

114
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,320
我们的卧底已经打入了他们内部
Our inside man is already inside.

115
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,640
告诉威震天 如果他觉得隔板认不出那个冒牌货
Tell Megatron he's fragged in the head if he thinks

116
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,570
那他的脑子就有问题了
Bulkhead won't sniff out an impositor.

117
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,680
你还不知道吗 霸天虎现在由我统领
Haven't you heard, I lead the Decepticons now.

118
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,280
你？哈！
You? Hah!

119
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:12,130
是的 他可能还有利用价值
Yes! Yes... He may yet be of use.

120
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,760
千面客很擅于伪装
Makeshift is very good at keeping up appearances.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,060
他只需骗过你的朋友们
He need only fool your friends long enough

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,850
然后从内部打开环陆桥
to open their Ground Bridge from within.

123
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,870
那样我就能知道汽车人基地的位置了
So that I may finally learn the location of the Autobot base.

124
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,960
接着 我派出的突击队
And send in my strike team to

125
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,330
会让擎天柱体内的能量洒遍整个基地
stain its floor with the spilled energon of Optimus Prime.

126
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,760
来吧 老千 让我看看你的能耐！
Come on, Jackie. Show me what you get.

127
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,200
好球！
Oh, oh, hahaha, nice lob.

128
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,030
那是什么？
So, what's that about?

129
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,380
那叫抛球
It’s called Lobby

130
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,400
塞博特恩上最受欢迎的消遣项目
the favorite past time on Cybertron

131
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,900
特别是对于勇士阶级
especially among warrior class.

132
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,520
来吧 拉夫! 让我们看看你的舞姿
Come on, Raf! Show us some moves.

133
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,840
哦 那好吧
Oh, alright.

134
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,440
没错 机器舞
Hehe, of course, they're robot.

135
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,740
擎天柱呢？
Where is Optimus?

136
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,090
兜风去了
Went for a drive.

137
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,200
领袖们不参加派对的
Primes don't party.

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,070
冲你来了！
Coming at you! Yew!

139
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,780
你们知不知道 我正在进行精确的校准工作！
You know what? I am attempting to perform sensitive calibrations here!

140
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,720
抱歉 大夫
Sorry, doc.

141
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,850
看来我们有点兴奋过头了
Guess we are a little charged up.

142
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,790
整座桥都是你建的 对吧？
You built this bridge from scratch, huh?

143
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,120
是的
I did.

144
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,810
这的确是个庞大的工程
That’s quite a feat of engineering.

145
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,960
是的 没错
Yes it is.

146
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,180
出问题了吗？
Something wrong with it?

147
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,350
上次运作时的响声听起来不对劲
I didn't care for the way it sounded of this last jump.

148
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,070
我把它关掉了
I put it in shutdown.

149
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,590
那需要用的时候怎么办？
What if you need to use it?

150
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,100
喔 中断磁盘整理程序会造成不可修复的损坏
Woo... I can't disrupt the defrag process without causing unreparable damage.

151
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,170
那…磁盘整理程序需要多久？
So uh... How long would the defrag take?

152
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,470
如果幸运的话 几小时吧
A few hours, if we are lucky.

153
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,500
也可能更久
Maybe longer.

154
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,630
千面客还没有打开他们的环陆桥
Makeshift still hasn't open their Ground Bridge

155
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,140
或传送他们的坐标
or otherwise transmitted their coordinates.

156
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,470
尽管他伪装得天衣无缝
His disguise may be flawless

157
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,110
但他不可能把汽车人一骗到底！
but he won't fool the Autobots forever!

158
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,590
当时我们在那里 通讯失灵
So there we were, no communications

159
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,180
能量不足 被虎子们包围
low on energon, surrounded by Cons.

160
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,090
猜猜千斤顶是怎么干的？
So what does wheeljack do?

161
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,300
告诉他们 老千！
Hehe, tell them, Jackie.

162
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,670
当然是我最拿手的！
Well, what I do best.

163
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,190
他拧开唯一的一颗手雷塞进了主换热器
He chucked his only grenade and smacked into the primary heat exchanger.

164
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,530
是啊 当时看来这主意不错
Yea, seem like a good idea at that time.

165
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,120
整个区域像超新星爆发一样
The joint went supernova!

166
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,910
帅啊…
Awesome...

167
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,280
是啊 现在都还能从我背上找出弹片呢
Yea, I'm still picking shrapnel out of my back side.

168
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,450
我不觉得惊讶
I'm not surprised

169
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,840
就冲你那背部的体积
given the size of your back side.

170
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,580
于是乎 老千有了个外号
There is it, Jackie signature.

171
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,560
“一颗手雷闯天下”
One grenade, one shot.

172
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,200
嘿 你没事吧？
Hey, you are alright?

173
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,920
怎么？
What?

174
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,480
你好像有些反常啊
You don't seem like yourself.

175
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,110
你这话什么意思？
What do you mean?

176
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,390
我不清楚 你似乎过于沉默了！
I dunno you seem, quiet.

177
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,210
在罐子里呆得太久了
Ah, I've been stuck in a can too long.

178
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,980
在我疯掉之前 出去透透气吧
I should go top side before I get stern crazy.

179
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,830
我早上有巡逻任务 你可以一起来
I have patrol in the morning. You can come with.

180
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,020
我们现在就去吧！
Let's go now.

181
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,440
让派对不欢而散？
And break up the party?

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,930
拜托 他们多喜欢你啊！
Come on. The gang's loving you.

183
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,050
去讲讲在暗峰山的战斗
You got to tell about the Battle of Dark Mount Pass.

184
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,700
你去吧 讲故事你在行
You'll tell them. You're better at it.

185
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,510
不如让神子带我逛逛你们的基地吧
How about if Miko here shows me the rest of your base.

186
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,620
啊 当然可以 老千 去吧
Well, yea. Sure, Jackie. Go ahead.

187
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,150
参观现在开始
Tour starts now.

188
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,850
你懂乐器吗？
Do you play any instruments?

189
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,350
你能飞吗？你揍过的霸天虎比隔板还多吗？
Can you fly? Have you thrust  more Decepticons than Bulkhead?

190
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,570
你没事吧？
You alright?

191
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,160
没事 只是…有点走神罢了
Yea. Just, out of thoughts I guess.

192
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,950
别告诉我 你…妒忌
Don't tell me you're... jealous.

193
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,090
妒忌神子交到新朋友？怎么会呢
That Miko's making a new friend? Come on.

194
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,770
只是…
Something

195
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,400
只是感觉千斤顶有些不对劲
something is just not right about Wheeljack.

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,100
隔板 想想看
Bulkhead, really.

197
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,890
他走过那么多星系
He's travelled galaxies.

198
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,370
你们几个世纪没见了
You haven't ever seen him for centuries.

199
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,460
他可能有点太空时差
He could just be rocket lagged.

200
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,740
你也知道 汽车人也是会变的
Well, bots do change, you know?

201
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,400
老千不会的
Not Jackie.

202
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,720
你哪儿也走不了 汽车人
You are not going anywhere, Autobot.

203
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,420
废话真多
Blablabla...

204
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,160
基本上就是这些
So that's pretty much it.

205
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,350
能量堆 发电机 军械库
Energon stock pile, power generator, armory

206
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,010
都是可以用来玩大爆炸的
everything you need to blow the joint sky high.

207
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,160
这个堡垒具体在哪里？
Where is this bunker located, exactly?

208
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,350
如果我告诉了你
If I told you

209
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,870
我就得把你的火种室扯出来！
I'd have to rip out your spark chamber.

210
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,660
开玩笑的！
Kidding!

211
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,530
就在内华达州的贾斯帕市郊区
Just outside Jasper in Nevada.

212
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,770
虽然我不觉得对你有什么用处
Though I don't expect that'll mean much to you.

213
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,260
说不定有用…
Can't say it does.

214
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,210
那 除了过桥 还有其他出路吗？
So, eh, anyway out of here besides bridging?

215
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,300
问这干嘛？
Why?

216
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,700
你不会是打算要走吧？
You’re not planning to leave already, are you?

217
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,810
来吧 我带你过去
Come on, I'll show you.

218
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,330
差不多了
Almost there.

219
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,620
听着 我比任何人都了解千斤顶
Look, I know Wheeljack better than anyone.

220
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,240
你们在聊什么呢？
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

221
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,920
我刚才在跟他们讲我们在暗峰山的战斗
I was just telling the guys all about you and me, at the Battle of Dark Mount Pass.

222
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,070
那故事可精彩了！
That’s a heck of the story.

223
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,190
没错 讲来听听！
Yep. Tell it.

224
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,370
讲 讲 讲 等我们兜完风后再讲吧？
Talk, talk, talk. How about after we go off roading?

225
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,370
神子 这不关你的事！
Miko, stay out of this.

226
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,500
隔板 别这样
Bulkhead, easy.

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,740
我看没必要…
I'm not sure I...

228
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,540
讲！
Tell it!

229
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,610
好吧 既然你要重温过去 隔板
Fine. You want to live in the past, Bulkhead.

230
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,790
雷霆救援队困在了一队霸天虎巡逻队和熔炼坑之间
The Wreckers were trapped between an Decepticon patrol and the melting pit.

231
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,360
虎子们凶猛无比
The cons were vicious

232
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,820
我们被完全压制了
bearing down on us with everything they had.

233
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,240
我和隔板与敌军一番大战
Me and Bulkhead engaged the enemy

234
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,660
把他们变成了废渣
left them for scrap

235
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,360
然后我杀出一条血路
then I made us a way out

236
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,440
踩着他们的后备箱 跳过了熔炼坑
using their backsides as stepping stone to cross the melton metal.

237
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,600
不就是这样吗？
Is that how it happened?

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,910
没错
Yea

239
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,310
的确就是这样
that's exactly how it happened.

240
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,010
除了一个小细节
Except for one little thing

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,330
我并不在场！
I wasn't there.

242
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,770
什么？
What?

243
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,240
我当时已经离开雷霆救援队 追随了擎天柱
I'd already left the Wreckers to join up with Optimus.

244
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,820
只看千斤顶的公开服役记录 你是不会知道的
But you wouldn't know that if all you did was access Wheeljack's public service record.

245
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,340
隔板 那些事跟这有什么…噢！
Bulkhead, what is that have to do with.. Oah...

246
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,120
神子!
Miko!

247
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,240
别过来 否则我把她捏成肉泥！
Stay back. Or I'll squeeze her into pulp.

248
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,880
千斤顶 你在干什么？
Wheeljack, what are you doing?

249
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,810
霸天虎懦夫！
Decepticon coward!

250
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,410
把女孩放了 我才是你的对手！
Let the girl go and face me.

251
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,900
别心急
Don't fret

252
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,370
接下来的仗够你打的
plenty of fighting to come.

253
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,300
到底有没有真的千斤顶？
Is there a real Wheeljack?

254
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
当然有
Oh indeed.

255
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,050
我估计红蜘蛛陛下正拿他找乐子呢
And I expect lord Starscream is making sport of him.

256
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,180
你肯定千面客收到你给他的坐标了吗？
Are you certain we are at the coordinates you supplied to makeshift?

257
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,320
那他还磨蹭什么？！
Then what is taking him?

258
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,820
你们的人也许受到了英雄般的欢迎
Maybe they give your boy such a hero's welcome.

259
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,220
他受到感召 所以弃暗投明了
He got the warm and fuzzies and decided to switch sides.

260
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,050
你不觉得你在以寡敌众吗？
Do you not see that you are vastly out-numbered?

261
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,630
他们是观赏我在你身上打洞的最好观众！
I see fellows who might bestly enjoy watching me pumps up dints into you.

262
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,930
干掉他！
Eh, destroy him!

263
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,470
到时候了！
About time!

264
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,900
瞧啊 瞧啊
Well, well.

265
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,770
让派对正式开始吧！
Let's get this party started!

266
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,520
如果是我 就会在那些臭虫进来之前把洞封上
I'd shut that hole before the stinks come through.

267
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,320
立即冲进环陆桥！
Enter the Ground Bridge now!

268
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,760
脏活儿让我来！
Ugly is mine.

269
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,320
哪个是真的千斤顶?
Which one is the real Wheeljack?

270
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,040
哎呀 我分不清了！
Eh, I lost track!

271
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,050
那才是我的老千！
That's my Jackie.

272
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,120
你 按下开关
You, hit the switch.

273
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,670
是时候清理垃圾了
It's time to take out the trash.

274
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,100
全归你了 哥们
All yours, buddy.

275
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,420
你们还在等什么？去啊！
What are you waiting for? Go!

276
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,220
好球！
Nice lob!

277
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,630
告诉我 至少你知道他们基地所在的位置！
Please, tell me that you at least learned the location of their base!

278
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,550
当然 红蜘蛛陛下
Indeed, lord Starscream.

279
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,220
它在一个隐秘的碉堡里 就在靠近…
It is in a hidden bunker, just outside of...

280
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,970
哇！后退！后退！后退！！
Wow! Back, back, back!

281
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,730
噢 不！
Oh no.

282
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,640
千面客 你这蠢货！
Makeshift, you fool!

283
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,230
就像一个不断循环的噩梦
It's like a recurring nightmare.

284
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,760
现在你是领袖卫队的一员了
Now that you're part of Team Prime.

285
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,930
你得选择一个伪装形态
We need to pick out a vehicle mode for you.

286
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,300
我有个建议
I have some ideas.

287
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,000
嗯 关于那个 小隔
Uh, about that, Bulk.

288
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,180
现在我的飞船修理好了
Now that my ship's repaired.

289
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,150
我很感兴趣 对于外面世界的未知力量
I'm itchy to know, what else I might find out there.

290
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,380
什么 你要离开？
Wait, you're leaving?

291
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,260
为什么？
Why?

292
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,000
千斤顶 记住 这里永远是你的港湾
Wheeljack, know that you always have a haven here.

293
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,080
老千从不原地踏步
Jackie never stays.

294
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,430
但他总会回来的
But he always comes back.

295
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,940
这里能坐下两个人 小隔
There's room for two, Bulk.

296
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,710
即使你的背部再大也不成问题
Even with a backside like yours.

297
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,360
谁知道在外面会找到什么呢？
Who knows who we might find out there?

298
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,970
一些老战友？
Some of the old crew?

299
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,490
听起来不错 老千
Heh, sounds like fun, Jackie.

300
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,900
但我已经心有所属
But my ties are here now

301
