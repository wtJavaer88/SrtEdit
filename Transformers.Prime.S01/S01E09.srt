1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,850
擎天柱！
Prime!

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,700
擎天柱！
Prime!

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,550
福勒探员 有何贵…
Special agent Fowler, to what do we owe...

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,310
还能干什么？霸天虎呗！
What else, Cons!

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,680
我把他们赶至绝路
I chased them off from some hard ordinates.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,490
他们也把我敲了下来！
But not before they blew me out of sky.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,240
又输了？
Hm，again?

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,240
他们想抢我的“那玩意儿”
They tried to smash and grab for the dingus.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,610
哪个玩意儿？
The... what's it?

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,620
动态核能发电系统（D.N.G.S）
Dynamic Nuclear Generation System.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,350
也就是“那玩意儿”
A.K.A. dingus.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,030
是种供能原型机 我正要送到西岸去测试
It's a prototype energy source. I'm porting to the coast for testing.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,070
太荒唐了
That's absurd.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,500
红蜘蛛怎么会看上这种原始技术？
Why would Starscream bother with such primitive technology?

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,280
我猜他们是想制造一种大规模杀伤性武器
I'm guessing they are making a big bad primitive weapon, of mass destruction.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,090
如果这个小东西被熔毁
If this baby would melt down

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,100
这里和周边四个州都可能受到辐射污染
it would radiate this state and the four next door.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,950
福勒探员说没说过 他在哪个州出的事？
Eh, did Agent Fowler say which state he is currently in?

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,470
我现在束手无策 擎天柱
I’m a sittin' duck here, Prime.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,270
我要你们打开环陆桥
I need you to spin up your bridge

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,920
在虎子们杀回来之前 火速把“那玩意儿”送到目的地
and send the dingus to its destination before the Cons come back for it.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,170
用环陆桥传送这种极不稳定的装置 恐怕不妥
I'm afraid that sending such a volatile device through the Ground Bridge is out of the question.

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,890
如果在传送途中发生意外
If there were to be an accident during transmission

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,020
辐射产生的污染就会通过环陆桥的漩涡扩散
the radiation of which you speak could propagate through Ground Bridge vortex

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,910
会波及50个州 甚至更远
and harm all 50 states, and beyond.

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
你还有别的高招吗？
You got any better ideas?

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,700
啊…不必了 福勒探员
Ahh... No need, Agent Fowler.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,150
我来负责开车
I will handle the driving.

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,810
这一路可够我受的
It's gonna be a long trip.

30
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,080
汽车人 出发！
Autobots, roll out.

31
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,700
你们的坐标已经锁定 擎天柱
We are locked on your coordinates, Optimus.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,290
不出意外的话 你们会在日落前到达目的地
Barring any complication you should reach the drop off point by sun down.

33
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,460
快走啊 死老头！
Move it, gramps!

34
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,450
福勒探员 有这个必要吗？
Agent Fowler, is that really necessary?

35
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,890
别跟我说你是个“三好司机”
Uh, don't tell me one of those textbook drivers.

36
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,990
货物由一辆无武装的民用卡车运送
They are transporting in an un-armed civilian truck.

37
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,970
派地面部队出击
Send in the ground units.

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,200
知道吗 这次你帮了我的大忙 擎天柱
You know, you're saving my bacon here, Prime.

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,720
能帮上忙 我很荣幸
I am proud to be of service.

40
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,280
当然 要是你们和虎子在自己的地盘上打 我就更轻松了
Of course, not like I'd need your help if you and the Cons had stuck to turning up your own corner of Galaxy.

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,200
你的意思是 在我们到来之前 你们的世界是太平盛世吗？
Are you suggesting that no evil existed in your world before we arrived?

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,730
这个嘛 这是…两码回事
Well, it was a… different evil.

43
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,280
听听收音机怎么样？
How about some radio?

44
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,430
你这种人大概喜欢听乡村音乐
You seem like a Nashville sound kind of guy.

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,340
就是他
That's the one

46
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,170
是那个虎子把我打下来的
the Con who shot me down.

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,730
他叫什么？翼形螺母？二愣子？还是鸟人？
Who is he? Wingnut? Dingbag? Skyguy?

48
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,720
看看身后
Watch your rear views.

49
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,750
施展不开拳脚 真是浑身发痒啊 老大
Feel like a little constricted without the use of my fist here, boss.

50
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,320
不到万不得已 必须保持车辆形态
Remain in vehicular mode unless absolutely necessary.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,850
居然来了一群虎子
A whole team of Cons!

52
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,960
什么？我没发现任何信号
What? I'm not picking up anything.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,050
他们一定使用了屏蔽技术
They must be utilizing a cloaking technology.

54
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,380
停车！
Pull over.

55
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,930
哎呀 我好怕怕啊！
Well I'll be dipped.

56
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,560
袭击我们的不是霸天虎 是人类
Our assailants are not Decepticons, they are humen.

57
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:19,960
人类？
Humen?

58
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,320
人类？
Humen?

59
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,010
拜托 敢挑衅汽车人？
Oh, please. Taking on our Bots?

60
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,280
他们死定了！
They are road kill!

61
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,650
先生们
Gentlemen

62
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,190
让他们停车
stop their engines.

63
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,850
他们是哪路的？
Who are these guys?

64
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,970
汽车人 保持伪装形态
Autobots, maintain your cover

65
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,720
使用最小武力 解除武装即可
and apply minimal force, disarmament only.

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,260
那些司机不一般
Those are not civilian drivers.

67
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,230
来点新鲜空气吧
Could use some air.

68
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,870
擎天柱 右转！
Prime, bear right!

69
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,690
我问什么 你就答什么！
Care to tell me everything I want to know?

70
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,680
希望你处理“那玩意儿”时 别这么笨手笨脚
I do hope you take better care of that dingus than you do your captives.

71
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,250
我是特工威廉・福勒
Special Agent William Fowler here.

72
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,940
报上名来！
Identify yourself!

73
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,920
我叫塞拉斯
I am Silas

74
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,060
不过你可能更熟悉另一个名字
by of greater consequence to you

75
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,580
我们是“机械党”
we are MECH.

76
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,610
给你个警告
Fair warning

77
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,180
我们自有办法拿到你的仪器
we will be helping ourselves to your device

78
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,550
不惜任何伤亡代价
even if it means inflicting cacualties.

79
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,230
真的吗？
Is that so?

80
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,840
告诉我 小塞
Tell me, Sygh?

81
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,680
“那玩意儿”现在的市价是多少？
What's the market price for a dingus these days?

82
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,630
你觉得我们是想卖掉它吗 福勒特工？
What makes you think we intend to sell it, Agent Fowler?

83
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,550
战争正在酝酿
There is a war brewing

84
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,250
世界秩序即将焕然一新
between the new world order and the newest.

85
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,960
胜者 必定是拥有最尖端科技的一方
And the victor, will be the side armed with the most innovative technology.

86
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,760
我说小塞
So Sigh

87
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,310
你觉得“机械党”已经掌握了最尖端技术吗？
you think MECH has all the most radical tech?

88
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,060
司机绝不是一般人
Definitely not civilian drivers.

89
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,230
回头见 小塞
Later, Sigh.

90
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,820
福勒探员 不要小看这个“塞拉斯”
Agent Fowler, do not take your Silas lightly.

91
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,070
威震天当时宣扬的正是这种理念
Megatron preached the very same ideology

92
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,100
后来塞博特恩爆发了大战 我们的星球毁于一旦
before plunging Cybertron into the Great War that destroyed our world.

93
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,050
擎天柱 准备实行第二步计划
Optimus, prepare to initiate phase 2.

94
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,450
向南五英里处 就是会合地点
5 miles ahead to the south,  you will reach the rendezvous point.

95
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,370
“向南五英里处 就是会合地点”
"5 miles ahead to the south,  you will reach the rendezvous point."

96
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,400
这么说 汽车人已经离开了他们的基地
So, the Autobots are outside the confines of their base

97
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,120
似乎正忙得焦头烂额
and sound otherwise engaged.

98
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,010
也就是说 他们对我们毫无防备
Which means, they will never see us coming.

99
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,790
找到并消灭他们！
Find them, and scrap them!

100
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,900
遵命 红蜘蛛陛下！
Yes, lord Starscream.

101
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,220
那儿就是目的地
There's our destination point.

102
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,140
汽车人 保持紧密队形
Autobots, keep a tight formation.

103
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,570
战术失误
Tactical lair

104
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,140
只有一个出口
only one way out.

105
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,770
空中支援？
Air support?

106
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,640
是敌还是友？
Ours or theirs?

107
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,930
擎天柱 有麻烦了！
Optimus, you have company.

108
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,880
军方怎么向自己人开火？
Military fired on one of their own?

109
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,790
长官 “那玩意儿”！
Sir, the dingus.

110
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,340
长官 好在没检测到辐射
Ugh, sir, I'm not reading any radiation.

111
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,830
“那玩意儿”没有熔毁
The dingus didn't melt down.

112
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,270
是的 确实没有
No, it did not.

113
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,440
福勒探员 为了你和汽车人的安全
Agent Fowler, I'm afraid that if you and we are to survive.

114
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,130
恐怕我们现在不得不解除伪装了
It has become absolutely necessary to drop our cover.

115
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,700
原来那些传言是真的
So the rumors are true.

116
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,750
机械生命体就站在我们眼前
Living technology stands before us

117
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,650
但恐怕他们长久不了
though perhaps not for very long.

118
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,040
作壁上观吧
Remain here.

119
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,500
悉听尊便
Will do.

120
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,340
跑了这么远
After a long road trip

121
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,390
终于可以变形了
it feels good to get out of the car

122
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,610
活动活动筋骨
stretch my legs

123
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,060
踢爆它几个排气管！
and kick some tailpipe.

124
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,070
长官 如果“那玩意儿”不在卡车上…
Sir, if the dingus wasn't in the truck..

125
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,520
对 这个嘛
Yes, that.

126
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,540
福勒特工 和巨人一起共事 千万要小心
Special Agent Fowler, you need a jung life walking among titans?

127
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,270
下来吧 我给你们引见引见
Come on, down. I'll introduce you.

128
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,250
另择吉日吧
In good time.

129
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,850
现在我很想知道 “那玩意儿”是如何凭空消失的
But in the moment I'm too busy wandering how the dingus might have vanished into thin air without a trace.

130
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,990
失陪了
Now if you could excuse me

131
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,500
我要去赶火车
I have a train to catch.

132
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,130
擎天柱！
Prime!

133
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,450
塞拉斯识破第二步计划了！
Silas got wise to phase two!

134
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,140
我知道了！
I understand!

135
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,690
擎天柱 能听到吗？
Prime! Do you read me?

136
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,780
擎天柱！
Prime!

137
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,460
擎天柱受了重伤！
Optimus is down!

138
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,680
“机械党”要去抢“那玩意儿”了！
And MECH's gonna grab the dingus.

139
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,180
快想想办法！
We need to think of something quick!

140
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,670
你是说 来个“第三步计划”？
You mean like a phase three?

141
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,070
好吧
OK.

142
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,900
开动脑筋！
Come on, think!

143
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,170
好吧 如果“机械党”想得到“那玩意儿”
Alright, if MECH wants the dingus

144
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,820
他们必须上火车
they have to get on that train.

145
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,800
要是我们先上车呢
What if we get on board first!

146
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,140
想想看 来个真人对打！
You know, run some human on human interference？

147
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,400
绝对不行！
Absolutely not!

148
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,140
没错 那等于自杀
Yea, that would be suicide.

149
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,290
拜托 想变成“大熔炉合众国”吗？
Hello?! The United States of Meltdown?

150
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,970
人命关天啊！
Lives are at stake?

151
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,520
是你们的命！
Yes, yours!

152
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,010
你们要传送的地方 不光是密闭空间
You want me to not only bridge you into a confined space

153
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,480
而且移动速度每小时140多公里！
but one traveling at 90 miles per hour?

154
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,180
我根本无法想象可能出现的意外
I can't even count the number of ways that can go wrong!

155
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,580
大面积错位损伤 四肢骨折 金属烧伤
Mass displacement trauma, twisted limbs, metal burn?

156
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,560
呃 也许没有最后那种
Well, maybe not the last one.

157
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,500
不管怎么说
Regardless

158
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,540
要把环陆桥坐标锁定在高速移动的物体上 几乎不可能
it is nearly impossible to fix Ground Bridge coordinates on something moving at that speed.

159
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,210
要是能…跟踪火车的坐标呢？
Would it help if we had access to the train's coordinates?

160
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,560
那另当…
Well...

161
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,800
解除他们的武装
Demobilize them.

162
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,650
我们进来了
We are in.

163
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,320
收到 杰克
I read you, Jack.

164
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,330
手机通讯补丁很管用
The cell phone com-link patch works.

165
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,690
拉夫 “机械党”的人要在车顶降落
Raf, MECH's landing on top of the train.

166
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,840
大概20秒后 会有个岔口
In about 20 seconds, you are gonna come to a fork.

167
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,580
抓紧了
Brace yourselves.

168
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,890
怎么回事？
What happened?

169
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,920
有黑客
Hacker.

170
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,960
初级黑客
Former hacker.

171
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,190
什么？
What?

172
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,900
我就说我们这技术不靠谱吧？
And what have I been saying all alone about our technology?

173
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,700
这算什么？帮我们争取10秒钟吗？
So what that buy us? 10 seconds?

174
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,250
拉夫失算了
Raf is using his touch.

175
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,220
想吃我一斧子吗？
You want a slice of this?

176
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,720
快来啊！
Well do you?

177
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
我也一样！
What she said!

178
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,020
长官！
Sir.

179
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,080
撤退
Retreat.

180
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,330
你可真勇猛
Wow, you are pretty fierce.

181
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,420
作战原则第一条
First rule of the combat

182
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,860
绝不给敌人留下战利品
never leave the enemy with the spoils.

183
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,530
救护车 “机械党”炸断了铁轨！
Ratchet, MECH's moved the train tracks.

184
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,930
快把我们传送回去！
You need to bridge us out of here.

185
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,010
还有那些士兵！
The soldiers, too.

186
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,460
我们无法跟踪火车的坐标数据！
We've lost access to the train data.

187
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,180
没有坐标 我就没法接你们回来！
I can't bridge you back without your coordinates.

188
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,420
擎天柱 “机械党”炸了铁轨 杰克和神子还在火车上
Optimus, Jack and Miko are on that train and MECH has blown the tracks!

189
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,260
我正赶过去
I'm on my way.

190
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,930
全速前进！
Maximum overdrive!

191
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,700
我们跳车怎么样？
Maybe we should jump?

192
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,570
时速可是140公里啊！
At 90 miles per hour?

193
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,030
要么摔死 要么烧死 你选吧
It's the impact or the meltdown, take you pick.

194
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,920
我们当初干嘛非来不可？
What we were thinking volunteering for this?

195
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,990
下次你最好先想办法来脱险
Next time your need to do a better job of talking us of the situations.

196
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,400
还有下次吗…
Next time?

197
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,050
如果我们跑到车尾 是不是能多活几秒钟？
Or we can ourselves another few seconds if we are in the back of the train, right?

198
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,370
神子 至少 我们能死在一起
Miko, at least, we are in this together.

199
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,090
拉夫 重要提示！
Raf, this is important!

200
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,190
一定要把我的吉他留给隔板
Make sure Bulkhead gets my guitar.

201
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,610
先别急着说遗言
Don't read the will just yet.

202
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,500
擎天柱在哪儿？
Where is Optimus?

203
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,180
他要赶火车
He has a train to catch.

204
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,640
身手不错嘛 天外来客
Well played, visitor.

205
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,240
但我们“机械党”不会善罢甘休
But MECH still has un-fielded advantages

206
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,420
我们会有办法和你们对抗的
and we will find a way to level that playing field.

207
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,900
就算要给你开膛破肚
Even if we have to open you up.

208
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,890
也要摸清你们的老底
To see what makes you tick.

209
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,810
擎天柱 你和孩子们…
Optimus, are you and the children

210
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,450
都好吗？
intact?

211
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,750
安然无恙 救护车
Intact, Ratchet.

212
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,900
危机解除了
Crisis averted.

213
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,480
不过我们脚下这颗星球 与想象中相去甚远
But the world in which we live is a different one than previously imagined.

214
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,460
这里也有本土的霸天虎…
One which is bond its own Decepticons

215
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,020
披着人皮的老虎
in human skin.
