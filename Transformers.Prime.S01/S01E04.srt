1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,440
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,400
“破坏者”宇宙大帝之血
It's as if the blood of Unicron the Destroyer

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,410
好像流遍了我浑身的经脉
flows through my veins.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,860
可那会是黑暗能量吗？
Dark Energon?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,230
那东西非常罕见 几乎搜索不到
It's so scarce as to be virtually non-existent.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,200
有生人介入
Contact with civilians.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,680
他们的安全由我们保护
We're protecting them.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,770
把这个福勒给我带来
Fetch me this Fowler.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,490
告诉我汽车人基地的位置
Tell me the location of the Autobot base.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,170
是求救信号
It's an SOS.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,630
- 糟了\N- 糟了
- Scrap.\N- Scrap.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,880
觉醒吧 我的战士们！
Rise, my army!

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,010
请看 这就是传说中的…黑暗能量！
Behold, the power of Dark Energon!

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,340
威震天亵渎了\N我们共同先祖的长眠之地…他于心何忍！
Megatron has desecrated the resting place of our fallen ancestors... and his own!

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,600
连死人也免不了被他推上战场
Not even the dead are free from his war-mongering.

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,610
终于 我感受到和黑暗能量共生的妙处了
At last, symbiosis, I can feel it.

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,870
我可以完全控制我的军队
I possess complete control over my army.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,410
摧毁他们！
Destroy them!

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,530
擎天柱 如果我们的对手已经死过一次
Optimus, if our combatants are already deceased

20
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,980
我们能再“杀死”他们吗？
How can we possibly defeat them?

21
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,160
救护车 撤退！
Ratchet, retreat!

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,970
你先返回基地！
Bridge yourself back to base!

23
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,640
不 我要和你共进退 擎天柱
No, I shall stand with you, Optimus.

24
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,960
战斗结束后 你可能需要治疗
You may require a medic when this is over with.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,520
我建议 把他们解剖
I recommend dissection.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,720
切得越碎越好！
The smaller the pieces, the better!

27
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,170
好主意 老朋友
Sound advice, old friend.

28
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,900
我已掌控了黑暗能量
I have mastered Dark Energon.

29
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,110
如果你战死 擎天柱
When you fall, Optimus

30
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,660
你也会成为我的部下
you too, shall join my army.

31
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,460
上车 快！
Get in, now!

32
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,080
谢谢 隔板
Thanks, Bulkhead.

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,580
是啊 谢谢
Yea, thanks.

34
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,410
你…你们怎么来了？
What... what are you doing here?

35
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,460
我们担心神子
We were worried about Miko.

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,640
你看到她了吗？
Have you seen her?

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,730
她长什么样？
What's she look like?

38
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,560
全体下车
Everyone out.

39
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,970
这一次 拜托 在这儿等着！
And this time, please, wait here!

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,390
神子在哪儿？
Where's Miko?

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,450
神子？！
Miko?

42
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,480
我吐在脚垫上了
I heaved on your floor mats.

43
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,990
抱歉
Sorry! Ugh...

44
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,990
提醒我 以后别坐过山车了
Remind me never to do that again.

45
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,470
他们把我们忘了吗？
Think they forgot about us?

46
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,990
我又要吐了
I'm gonna heave again.

47
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,010
把他们扔进监牢
Bring them to the brig.

48
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,090
红蜘蛛指挥官把另一个人类也关在那儿
Commander Starscream has keeping the other human there.

49
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,700
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

50
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,330
感谢你们清理了大门口
Appreciate you cleared the front door for us.

51
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,860
但进攻霸天虎战舰可不是娱乐活动
But storming the Decepticon warship was not on the activities list.

52
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,520
我们像在娱乐吗？
Tell me about it.

53
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,070
- 自己人！\N- 还用说！
- Friendly!\N- Hello!

54
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,920
竟然带人类出来打仗？
Brought the humans, huh?

55
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,930
你来试试撇下他们看看！
You try getting them to stay behind!

56
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,580
我们得找到福勒 再把孩子们带出去
We need to find Fowler and get these kids outta here.

57
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,690
他在监牢
Uh, he's in the brig.

58
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,430
我亲爱的福勒探员
My dear Agent Fowler.

59
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,070
你一定知道 汽车人已经把你抛弃了
You do realize the Autobots have abandoned you.

60
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,870
我是你现在唯一的依靠
I am the only one you can rely upon now.

61
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,290
快把我想知道的告诉我
So, tell me what I want to know

62
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,670
否则…
or...

63
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,210
求你了 别这样
Please, no more.

64
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,390
他们在…政府的秘密基地
They're in secret government base.

65
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,920
说下去
Go on.

66
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,330
还有呢？
Yes?

67
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,600
那是个旧炼钢厂
In the old steel mill

68
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,450
好像在嘉年华游乐园地下吧？
was it under that carnival's fun house?

69
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,860
去看看外面怎么回事！
Someone find out what is going on out there!

70
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,420
擎天柱 长时间接触黑暗能量
Ugh, Optimus, this prolonged exposure to Dark Energon

71
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,340
我们会吃不消的
is sapping our strength.

72
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,560
我们必须背水一战
We cannot falter now.

73
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,270
擎天柱！
Optimus! Eah...

74
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
这么多年过去了 擎天柱
After all these years, Optimus

75
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,690
宝刀不老嘛！
still at the top of your game!

76
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,860
我的将士们 干掉他们！
My legion, finish them!

77
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,850
安全
Clear.

78
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,200
在这儿等着
Wait in here.

79
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,260
他们行动缓慢 容易受到攻击
They're slowing us down, and they're easy targets.

80
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,830
只要他们不乱跑
They'll be alright in here

81
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,080
就不会有麻烦
as long as they stay put.

82
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,500
刚才真是太吓人了
That was intense.

83
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,360
现在不吓人吗？
Was?

84
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,150
我们被卷进来 都是因为你
It's your fault that we're stuck in this intensity.

85
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,510
你是怎么想的 神子？
What were you thinking, Miko?

86
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,260
是我让你跟来的吗？
Did I ask you to follow me?

87
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,340
是你要组建乐队的
You wanted us to be a band.

88
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,120
乐队不是应该“步调一致”吗？
Doesn't that usually mean "playing together"?

89
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,440
那我要考虑单飞了！
Well, maybe I decided to go solo!!

90
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,890
那我还是要关心你的安全！
Well, maybe I have some regard for your safety!

91
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,060
噢 对不起 你也叫擎天柱吗？
Oh, I'm sorry, is your name Optimus?

92
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,180
有隔板保护我就够了 谢谢关心！
You can leave my protection to Bulkhead, thank you very much!

93
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,780
别闹了！你们俩闭嘴！
Stop it! Both of you!

94
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,650
噢 嘿嘿嘿 拉夫 拉夫 没事的
Oh, hey hey hey, Raf, Raf, it's... it's ok.

95
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,960
是啊 我们不会有事的
Yea, we're gonna be fine.

96
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,620
我们的搭档会回来救我们的
Our bots will come back for us.

97
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,560
是啊 他们会把我们送回家
Yea. They're gonna take us home.

98
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,410
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

99
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,760
嘿 拉夫
Hey, Raf

100
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,310
你能看懂那个吗？
what do you make of that?

101
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,700
是重要资料
It's important.

102
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,330
非常重要
Really important.

103
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,990
睁开眼 你这可怜的肉团！
Wake up, you pathetic lump of flesh!

104
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,300
奶奶？该吃饼干了吗？
Mmm... Grandma? Is it cookie time?

105
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,390
怎么了？！
Well?

106
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,550
别太心急！
Not so fast!

107
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,860
我不想动粗
I wouldn't.

108
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,270
噢 我可没准儿…
Oh, but I MIGHT...

109
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,130
必须把它交给擎天柱
We got to get this to Optimus.

110
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,250
说不定这是太空玉米片的食谱呢
How do you know it isn't just a recipe for space nachos?

111
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,270
我一看就知道那是数学问题
I know math when I see it.

112
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,700
那可是个信息量巨大的方程式
And that is one serious equation.

113
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,060
你可以…下载它吗？
Can you... download it?

114
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,500
我有个闪存盘
I got a flash drive.

115
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,570
但这里好像没有接口
But I don't see anywhere to plug it in.

116
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,090
这东西太外星化了
This tech is way alien.

117
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,330
现在 我要带福勒探员先走一步
Now, Agent Fowler and I will take our leave.

118
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,260
恶魔说 耶！
The evil says "yep!"

119
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,410
神子 拍张照片！
Miko, take a picture!

120
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,800
好主意！
Great idea!

121
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,910
嘿 说你呐！
Hey, you!

122
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,720
不是它 是那个！
Not of that, of that!

123
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,480
快 快 快！
Go, go, go!

124
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,310
我说过 别乱跑！
I told you to stay put!

125
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,210
我喜欢馅饼
I like pie.

126
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,030
可以去吃馅饼吗？
Can we stop for pie?

127
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,430
你们找到福勒了！
You found Fowler!

128
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,620
好哎！
ROCK ON!

129
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,880
干得漂亮 擎天柱！
Bravo, Optimus!

130
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,150
这只是个序幕
Though this is but a prelude.

131
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,800
你最好为正戏保存一点实力！
You may wish to save your strength for the main event!

132
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,830
你不会得逞的 威震天
You will not prevail, Megatron.

133
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,440
除非我体内的能量枯竭！
Not while energon still flows

134
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,370
除非我体内的能量枯竭！
through my veins!

135
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,770
来日方长 我体内的黑暗能量也长流不息
Fit in, for this Dark Energon which flows through mine.

136
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,210
如果这还不算威震天的正戏
If this wasn't Megatron's in game

137
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,060
什么才算呢？
what is?

138
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,870
你们到底怎么了？
What happened to you guys anyway?

139
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,530
我们碰上了一队不死的塞博特恩战士
We engaged an army of undead Cybertronian warriors.

140
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,970
僵尸？
Zombies?

141
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,280
你们打僵尸竟然不带我？
You fought zombies and I missed it?

142
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,630
隔板
Bulkhead

143
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,960
让人类跟你一起参加战斗 可不是个明智的决定
you exercised extremely poor judgement at allowing the humans to accompany you.

144
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,980
不会有下次了 擎天柱
It won't happen again, Optimus

145
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,710
我…我发誓
I promise.

146
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,840
那不关隔板的事
But it wasn't Bulkhead's fault.

147
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,930
神子 别说了！
Miko, please!

148
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,840
你们看
And check it out.

149
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,290
这才叫侦察！
Recon!

150
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,320
救护车 你来看
Umm... Ratchet, have a look.

151
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,130
这对威震天来说可能是重要资料
It could be of importance to Megatron.

152
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,950
喔 威震天回来了？
Wow, Megatron's back?

153
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,260
是个坏消息 对吧？
That's really bad news, right?

154
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,030
我…看不懂
I... don't understand.

155
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,330
噢
Oops.

156
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,470
那个虎子想把拉夫炸飞
That's the Con who'd tried to blow Raf away.

157
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,300
他还没来得及动手
At least that's what it look like

158
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,320
隔板就三下五除二把它解决了
before Bulkhead rearrange his grill.

159
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,350
神子 拉夫差点没命
Miko, Raf was almost killed!

160
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,550
这可不是闹着玩的
This isn't a game

161
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,840
你那死脑袋什么时候才会明白？
when do you gonna get that through your fixed skull?

162
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,980
嗯 我们全都差点没命 杰克
Umm, we were all almost killed, Jack.

163
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,610
你 我 拉夫
You, me, Raf

164
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,070
还有他们！
even them!

165
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,900
如果和汽车人在一起 每天都有生命危险
Well, if this was just an average day with the Autobots

166
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,390
那我不干了
then I don't wanna be a part of it.

167
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,740
彻底退出
Not any more.

168
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,490
杰克
Jack

169
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,280
我们从没想过让你去冒险
putting you in harm's way was never our intent.

170
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,280
可是 生命悬于一线的不止是你们三个了
However, it is no longer the safety of you three that is at risk

171
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,400
而是全体人类
but the safety of all human kind.

172
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,040
如果你们要离开 我们会尊重这个决定
We will respect your decision if you wish to leave.

173
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,210
别依依不舍了 门在这儿
No point in long good-byes. Here's the door.

174
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,960
走吧 拉夫
Come on, Raf.

175
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,280
我要留下来 杰克 学校见
I'll be ok, Jack. See you at school.

176
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,200
好的
Sure thing.

177
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,580
我知道 你们不存在
I know, you don't exist.

178
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,580
别逼我去抓你回来
Don't make me hunt you down.

179
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,830
求你了 威震天陛下 我没料到…
Please, Lord Megatron, I meant no... Ah...

180
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,770
我告诉过你要等我的命令！
I ordered you to await my command!

181
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,490
可你干的蠢事弄垮了我的飞船！
Instead, your mindless agenda resulted in the disabling of my ship!

182
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,340
还耽误了我的大事！
And the delay of my plans!

183
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,280
我没别的想法 主人
My intentions were pure, master.

184
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,330
我只是想帮您除掉擎天柱！
I only wanted you to be rid of Optimus!

185
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,930
除了我 没人能除掉擎天柱
No one rids me of Optimus Prime but me.

186
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,940
你明白吗
Do you understand

187
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,950
明白吗？
do you?

188
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,250
威震天陛下 我会处理好的 我发誓！
Lord Megatron, I will make things right, I swear!

189
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,600
我知道怎么能让您的计划回到正轨！
I know how to set your plans back on course!

190
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,710
说清楚点 红蜘蛛
Explain, Starscream

191
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,320
别磨蹭
quickly.

192
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,710
我现在明白了 你要赶回家修车
Now I understand why you had to rush home.

193
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,490
你没有更刺激的事可做吗 神子？
Don't you have something more exciting to do, Miko?

194
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,130
看来 你就在这儿混日子 对吧？
So, this is where you hang, huh?

195
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,450
在东京老家的时候
Back home in Tokyo

196
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,840
我有可爱的父母和两只纯种猫

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,150
琪琪和叮当

198
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,450
我去最好的学校 三岁就开始学钢琴
I went to the best school, to piano lessons since I was three.

199
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,350
挺好的嘛
How nice for you.

200
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,440
不 闷死了
No, how boring.

201
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,880
那不是我想要的
It wasn't me.

202
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,810
当时要转学到这儿 我高兴得不得了
Why do you think I jumped at the chance to transfer here?

203
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,980
因为内华达州贾斯帕是世界娱乐中心吗？
To Jasper, Navada

204
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,180
因为内华达州贾斯帕是世界娱乐中心吗？
the entertainment capital of the world?

205
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,170
谁知道啊 唉 那些人撒谎
Yeah, well, the bros sure lied.

206
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,410
学钢琴其实也挺有意思的
Piano lessons were starting to look pretty good, in fact.

207
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,330
然后 就发生了过去几天的事情
But then, the last couple of days happened.

208
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,820
你到底想说什么？
Do you have a point?

209
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,550
你觉得呢？
You bet?

210
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,250
你今天做的我都看见了
I saw what you did today

211
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,790
你救了拉夫
when you saved Raf

212
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,640
还救了我
when you came to save me.

213
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,730
这些年我一直学着要负责任
I've been raised to be responsible

214
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,910
对功课 对妈妈 对工作负责任
to my schoolwork, to my mom, my job.

215
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,270
哥们儿 听我说
Dude, hear me out.

216
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,730
你不是厨子
You're no fry cook

217
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,380
你是摇滚明星
you're a rock star.

218
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,980
别装平凡了 杰克
Stop pretending you're normal, Jack.

219
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,660
你绝对不是这种人
You'll never fit in.

220
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,390
你注定要干些大事
You were born to do so much more.

221
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,880
谢谢你 神子
Thanks, Miko.

222
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,120
但我觉得平凡更适合我
But I think normal suits me fine.

223
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,990
这不可能
It can't be.

224
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,120
擎天柱！
Optimus!

225
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,510
这些是时空漩涡发生器的技术资料
These are engineering specs for a space-time vortex generator.

226
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,580
威震天正在建造太空桥
Megatron's building a Space Bridge

227
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,720
也许他已经建成了
if he hasn't already.

228
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,680
他走得越早越好
The sooner he leaves, the better.

229
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,280
隔板 太空桥是个双向通道
Bulkhead, a Space Bridge runs in two directions.

230
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,450
威震天可能不是要离开地球
Megatron may not be using it to leave Earth

231
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,490
而是用它召集军队
but to bring through his conquering army.

232
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,850
那就是威震天所谓的正戏吗？
The main event Megatron referred to...

233
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:06,000
可是 唯一能让威震天召唤无数死人的地方是…
But the only place Megatron could possibly recruit that many fallen warriors...

234
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
一点没错…
Precisely...

235
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,970
塞博特恩
Cybertron.
