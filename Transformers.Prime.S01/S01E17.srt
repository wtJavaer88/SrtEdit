1
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,510
只使用压制火力
Suppression fire only.

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,200
我们这次抓活的
We take this one alive.

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,680
密集队形
Tight formation.

4
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,050
别告诉我 机械党居然看不出来
Don't tell me MECH never considered that

5
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,170
受伤的霸天虎在公开频道发出求救信号 可能是个陷阱
an open channel distress signal from an injured Decpeticon might be a trap.

6
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,010
下回我会牢记在心的
I'll bear that in mind next time.

7
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,560
下回？
Haha, next time?

8
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,210
你对倒霉的打击干的那些事 已经成了霸天虎无线电台的热门话题
Decepticon radio chatter's all abuzz about the workover you gave poor Breakdown.

9
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,730
作为一名前霸天虎成员
As an ex-Con myself

10
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,320
我真该收拾你一顿！
I really should have disarrayed you for that!

11
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,740
不过 一个故交和她的小无赖
But, an old acquaintance and her nasty little human destoried my ship and skinned my knee.

12
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,390
我一定要以牙还牙 干掉他们
I mean to pay them back in kind, both of them.

13
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,510
如你所见
You see.

14
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,760
我比大多数霸天虎更能适应这个鬼地方
I make it in and out of place as most Decepticons can't

15
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,420
但我毕竟是初来乍到
but I'm still learning to navigate this planet.

16
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,740
机械党能得到什么好处？
What's in it for MECH?

17
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,220
我会饶你一命
I'll let you live.

18
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,340
你本想来抢回那个受伤的“变形金刚” 对吗？
And since you came to collect that "Transformer", was it?

19
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,930
我可以把阿尔茜的残骸留给你
I'll throw in whatever is left of Arcee

20
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,450
但是 我要尝鲜
after I've broken her.

21
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,850
谢谢你送我回家 杰克
Thanks for walking me home, Jack.

22
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,490
你真有风度
You're a real gentleman.

23
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,910
我可不想在睡前听见你发动机的轰鸣
I don't want you reved up before bedtime.

24
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,430
妈妈睡觉很轻 而且…
Mom's a light sleeper, and...

25
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,600
我想她不会明白…
I don't think that she'd understand about...

26
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,240
明白什么 杰克？
Understand what, Jack?

27
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,440
明白这个月你为什么第三次违反宵禁？
You breaking curfew for the third time this month?

28
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,510
妈妈？
Mom.

29
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,420
明白为什么你的老板打电话 说你又没去换班？
Or why your boss called about you missing another shifted work?

30
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,920
还是为什么我收到 你的艺术史老师发来的邮件
Or maybe the email I received from your art-history teacher

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
讨论你上课时睡觉的问题？
who's concerned you've been falling asleep in class?

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,390
妈妈 他翻来覆去只说两个词 美术和历史
Well, two words, mom, art and history.

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,540
告诉我 那些传言不是真的 杰克
Tell me the rumors aren't true Jack.

34
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,780
告诉我 你没用摩托车去飙车
Tell me you're not racing that motorcycle.

35
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,290
不 不 等等…你从哪儿听说的？
No, no, wait... Where did you hear that?

36
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,190
这是个小地方 人言可畏
Small town, people talk.

37
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,320
我在急诊室工作 杰克
I work in an emergency room, Jack.

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,140
我可见过飙车的下场
I've seen what can happen.

39
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,890
求求你 告诉我 你没跟那群坏孩子学坏
So please, tell me you haven't fallen in with the bad crowd.

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,590
什么？
What?

41
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,960
不 不不 我的朋友们都是好孩子
No, no, no, no. My friends are the good crowd.

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,480
好得不能再好了
Seriously good.

43
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,380
我让你留下那辆车 是因为我相信 你已经够成熟了 能掌握分寸
I let you have that bike because you convinced me you are mature enough to handle it.

44
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,320
但我认为需要适当提醒你一下
But I think you may need a gentle reminder.

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,480
信息已查收 妈妈
Message received, mom

46
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,620
铭记在心
loud and clear.

47
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,740
这次谈话很受用
I'm glad we had this talk.

48
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,840
我是说
I meant

49
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,170
这几个星期不准骑摩托车 看你能不能收心
let's see if a few weeks without the distraction of your motorcycle will do the trick.

50
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,850
但是…
Eh, but...

51
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,490
没有但是！除了学校和工作 你哪儿也不许去
No but! You're grounded from everything but school, and work.

52
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,820
如果你想骑车出去
And if you want to take a bike to either

53
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,090
就骑自行车吧
you'll pedal.

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,920
我是认真的 杰克
Serious face, Jack.

55
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,640
如果我发现摩托车不在车库…
If I see that motorcycle out of the garage...

56
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,860
好了 去洗洗睡吧
Now, go wash up and get some sleep.

57
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,000
我爱你
I love you.

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,530
你被禁足期间 我会想你的
I'll miss you while you're grounded.

59
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,800
别担心 阿尔茜 我每天都会来看你的
Don't worry Arcee. I'll visit you here every day.

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,490
呃 杰克？
Eh, Jack?

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,870
我不能呆在这里
I won't be here.

62
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,600
静坐两个星期 我的轮胎肯定会胖死了
Sitting on my fat tire for two weeks is not an option.

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,200
不不不… 你也看见我妈那副表情了
No, no, no... You saw mom's serious face.

64
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,160
阿尔茜 让她一直蒙在鼓里 我已经感觉很愧疚了
Well, Arcee, I feel badly enough that I had to lie to her all this time

65
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,610
但如果你不在
but if you're not here

66
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
她会觉得 我把她的话当成耳旁风
she's gonna think that I'm blowing her off.

67
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,470
深呼吸 杰克
Deep breath Jack.

68
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,420
你妈妈很晚才下班
Your mom works late nights.

69
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,730
我会尽量在她到家之前 回到车库
I'll try to be back in the garage before she gets home.

70
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,070
但是… 不敢保证
But... no promises.

71
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,450
嘿 妈妈
Hey, mom.

72
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,200
杰克 你今晚不打算吃外卖吧
Jack, I hope you're not planning to eat take-out tonight.

73
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,980
我提前下班了 可以给禁足的儿子做一顿营养晚餐
I took my break early so I could cook my grounded son a wholesome dinner.

74
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,320
哟…有机豆腐！好东西！
Oh-organic tofu! Awesome!

75
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,300
嘿 你肯定比我快 我一会儿就到家
Hey, eh, car beats ten-speed. I'll be home soon.

76
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,330
我爱你 再见
Love you. Bye!

77
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,990
拜托 快接 快接 快接
Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up.

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,120
阿尔茜！你不会没在车库里吧？
Arcee! You wouldn't be in the garage right now?

79
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,320
我没在 杰克
Negative, Jack.

80
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,140
我们回头再说行吗？
Can we talk about this later?

81
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,080
不行 妈妈正在回家的路上
No. Mom's on her way home.

82
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,730
如果你不立刻回家 我就要被禁足一辈子了
If you don't race back there right now, I will be grounded for life.

83
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,330
而且妈妈可能让我把你拆了卖掉
And mom will make me sell you for parts.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,820
小蜂 你能应付吗？
Bee, can you handle it?

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,190
救护车 我需要环陆桥
Ratchet, I need to bridge.

86
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,590
杰克！
Jack!

87
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,860
杰克 你居然不听我的话
Jack! I can't believe you disobeyed me.

88
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,290
摩托车呢？
Where is the motorcycle?

89
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,000
呃…
Eh...

90
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,440
你在说什么？
What do you mean?

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,160
我不是把她放在那儿了吗
She's right where I left her.

92
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,090
是你让哪个狐朋狗友偷偷送来的
Did you get one of your crew to sneak it in?

93
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,200
还是你刚刚推进来的？
Or did you just walk it up again?

94
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,230
好吧 妈妈 你真的想知道？
OK, mom. You really wanna know?

95
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,740
做好心理准备
Fasten your seatbelt.

96
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,120
我的摩托车是个有自主意识的机械生命体 来自一颗遥远的星球
My motorcycle is a sentient robotic organism from a distant planet

97
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,860
她的队伍驻扎在地球上
part of a team stationed here on Earth

98
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,320
正在打一场秘密战争
fighting a secret war.

99
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,980
放学后的大部分时间 我都和她的战友呆在一起
And I spent most of my time after school hanging with her crew.

100
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,950
杰克…
Jack...

101
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,370
最酷的是
And the coolest thing

102
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,320
这还不是她的真实形态
this isn't even her actual form.

103
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,070
她其实是个巨大的机器人 可以变成摩托车
She's really a giant robot, who can transform into a vehicle.

104
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,730
够了 杰克
Enough, Jack.

105
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,170
没事了 阿尔茜 现身吧
It's OK, Arcee, show yourself.

106
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,430
她… 她很害羞
She is... She's shy.

107
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,710
阿尔茜？说真的
Arcee? Really?

108
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,220
别再躲了 不用撒谎了
No more hiding, no more lies.

109
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,100
噢 拜托 出发啊！
Oh, come on, roll out already!

110
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,290
那么 嗯…
So, em

111
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,930
那群和你在一起的坏孩子是…
the bad crowd you've been hanging out with is a...

112
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,900
科幻俱乐部的？
science fiction club?

113
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,510
我要回去工作了
I have to get back to work

114
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,640
等我回家 我们再继续谈
we will continue this when I get home.

115
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,920
真是两肋插刀啊 “搭档”
Thanks for the support, "partner".

116
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,020
别怪我 记住…
Don't blame me, remember...

117
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,330
我知道 我知道…
I know, I know...

118
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,710
你不存在
You don't exist.

119
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,390
你飞船上的黑匣子 在爆炸中受到严重损毁
Your ship's black box sustained serious damage in the explosion.

120
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,740
但我们用软件从安保部件中 恢复了部分画面
But our software was able to reconstruct a few frames from the security thingy.

121
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,330
就是他
That's him.

122
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,490
我的杰克
My Jack.

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,420
我们的面部识别算法 会把杰克的图像发到网上
Our facial recognition algorithm will send Jack's image across the web--

124
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,080
不是你那种网
another kind of web.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,320
啊… 有料了
Ah... the mother lode.

126
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,650
政府资料库？
Government database?

127
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,230
社交网站
Social networking page.

128
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,980
所有关于杰克的有用信息都在这里了
Everything worth knowing about Jack Darby is right here.

129
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,580
十六岁 内华达州贾斯帕市
Age sixteen, Jasper, Nevada.

130
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,480
母亲是… 琼・达比 一名护士
Mother... June Darby, a nurse.

131
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,820
或许我对杰克太苛刻了
Maybe I'm being too hard on Jack

132
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,370
可是他撒谎
but he lied.

133
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,820
要让他吸取教训 我只能坚持…
And the only way he's gonna learn is if I stick to my...

134
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,710
阿尔茜 我妈回来了吗？
Arcee, is mom home yet?

135
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,870
我没看见她的车
I didn't see her car.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,500
不知道
Don't know.

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
我也是赶在她之前 从基地传送过来
I just bridged from base to beat her here.

138
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,150
哦 那儿有你的一个包裹
Oh, and there's a package for you.

139
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,290
你好 杰克
Hello, Jack.

140
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,540
塞拉斯
Silas.

141
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,440
这是什么？怎么回事？
What is it? What's going on?

142
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,300
机械党
MECH.

143
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,690
他们连我住哪儿都知道？
They know where I live?

144
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,120
我们对你家人的了解 更胜于你
We know things about your family that even you don't know.

145
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,400
比如 你知道你妈妈身在何处吗？
For example, do you know where your mother is?

146
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,910
你做了什么…
What did you...

147
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,230
要知道 杰克 我们不打算伤害她
Understand, Jack. We have no intention of hurting her.

148
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,410
事实上 我们更乐意让你们母子俩尽快团聚
In fact, we'd like to reunite the two of you as soon as possible.

149
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,360
只要你和阿尔茜 跟着这个通讯器内置的GPS坐标
I just need you and Arcee to follow the GPS coordinates programmed into this communicator.

150
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,110
它会带你们来到我的临时军营
They'll lead you to the temporary facility I've set up.

151
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,180
救护车…
Ratchet...

152
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,070
阿尔茜！
Arcee?

153
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,360
我是不是忘了说 我们的通讯器 能扰乱联络信号和你的大脑？
Did I not mention our communicator scrambles the signal and your brains?

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,580
无论是破解通讯 还是企图联系其他汽车人
Any break in communication or attempt to reach the other Autobots

155
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,880
达比小姐就会…那个…
and Miss Darby... Well

156
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,760
发生什么后果 我可概不负责
I wouldn't want to feel responsible for the outcome.

157
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,990
如果因为我被牵扯进来 导致她发生意外 我…
If anything happens to her because of my connection to all this, I...

158
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,630
杰克 机械党只对我感兴趣
Jack, MECH is only interested in me.

159
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,920
他们一旦如愿以偿
Once they get what they want

160
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,780
就会放了你妈妈
they'll let your mom go.

161
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,720
这怎么能让我安心
That's not exactly reasuring.

162
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,380
你也是我的家人
You're family, too.

163
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,480
那么… 怎么办？
So... What's the plan?

164
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,890
老办法
The usual.

165
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,020
妈妈？
Mom?

166
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,090
是在找琼吗？
Looking for June?

167
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,540
她就在附近某个地方挂着呢
She's hanging around here somewhere.

168
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,840
毒蜘蛛！
Airachnid!

169
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,480
她怎么来了？
What's she doing here?

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,590
帮帮他们 求你了
Help them, please.

171
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,150
他们和你一样 是人类
They are humen like you!

172
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,230
你不能让毒蜘蛛…
You can't let Airachnid...

173
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,860
几条人命不值一提 你才是我们想要的科学奇迹
A few human lives are a small price to pay for a miracle of science like yourself.

174
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,340
阿尔茜
Arcee...

175
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,900
一会儿我要和你私下里谈谈
You and I will have a private session later.

176
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,470
我保证
Promise.

177
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,940
先生们
Gentlemen.

178
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,690
我对人类还不完全了解
I'm still learning about human kind

179
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,000
但有件事我很清楚 杰克
but one thing is clear to me, Jack.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,770
你们人类对于家人格外关心
You people care deeply about family.

181
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,770
因此 我能想到的最有爱心的复仇手段
Therefore, the sweetest revenge I could possibly devise

182
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,290
莫过于让你亲眼看我如何让你家破人亡
would be to make you watch as I take your family apart.

183
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,370
如果你敢伤害我妈妈
If you hurt my mother

184
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,720
- 我…
- I...

185
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,720
- 你应该记得我很喜欢赛跑
- You remember how much I enjoy sport

186
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,960
对吧 杰克？
don't you, Jack?

187
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,890
所以 我要给你个机会去救你妈妈
So I'll give you the opportunity to save your mother.

188
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,120
我把她藏在了这附近
I've stashed her close by.

189
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,010
如果你能在十二点的钟声响起前救下她
If you can rescue her before the stroke of twelve

190
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,980
我就把你们俩完璧归赵
I will let both of you go unharmed.

191
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,720
成交吗？
Deal?

192
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,790
如果我做不到呢？
And if I can't?

193
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,460
你认为呢？
What do you think?

194
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,400
求求你 别让她这么做
Please, don't let her do this.

195
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,900
你放我们走 我们谁都不说
You can let us go. We won't tell anyone.

196
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,090
够了
Enough.

197
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,020
没错 杰克
Yes, Jack.

198
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,860
要像个男子汉
Man up already.

199
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,460
六分钟
Six minutes.

200
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,290
妈妈 妈妈！
Mom? Mom!

201
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,510
虽然我们答应那个蜘蛛人 由她给你开第一刀
Now, I know we promised the spider-bot that she would have first crack at you

202
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,480
但是我有预感 她不再打算借刀杀人…
but something tells me she plans to turn our mutual crisscross...

203
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,400
而是想一箭双雕
... into a double-cross.

204
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,930
塞拉斯 我们现在没法把它运走
Silas, we don't have the means of transporting it right now.

205
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,920
那我们只能见好就收了
We'll have to cut and run.

206
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,200
切开她
Open her up.

207
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,240
妈妈！
Mom!

208
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,500
妈妈！
Mom!

209
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,230
杰克？
Jack?

210
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,930
杰克 你怎么来了？
Jack, what are you doing here?

211
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,290
这些人是谁？
Who are these people?

212
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,670
我怎么跑到…这里面了？
How did I get in this, this... stuff.

213
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,160
别担心 妈妈 我会把你弄出来的
Don't worry, mom. I'm gonna get you out.

214
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,220
杰克 那些机器人都是真的吗？
Jack, the robots are real?

215
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,780
我提前完成了！
I beat your deadline!

216
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,450
恐怕没有 杰克
'fraid not, Jack.

217
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,180
在午夜找到你的妈妈还不算数
The task wasn't for you to find your mother by mid-night.

218
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,250
你必须救下她
You had to rescue her.

219
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,660
但时间到了
And time's up!

220
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,760
现在
Now.

221
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,080
乖乖地坐在一边
Take a seat, sit back

222
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,340
欣赏恐怖表演吧
and enjoy the horror show.

223
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,500
快点儿 先生们
Make haste, gentlemen.

224
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,210
弄乱一点没关系
And don't worry about making a mess.

225
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,980
说起来 杰克
You know, Jack.

226
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,550
她是你的妈妈
She is your mom.

227
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,610
我为什么要独享快乐呢？
Why should I have all the fun?

228
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,430
选择权给你 是痛苦难耐 还是痛不欲生？
So you get to choose, agonizing, or excruciating?

229
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,930
不 不！
No, no!

230
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,310
杰克 你妈妈想知道答案
Jack, your mother wants to know.

231
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,780
别吊她的胃口喔
Don't leave her "dangling".

232
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,860
你这怪物 住手！
You monster. Stop this!

233
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,350
时间只够取出一个部件
We only have time to take one part.

234
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,710
直接拿走心脏
Go straight for the heart.

235
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,460
让她走
Let her go.

236
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,040
不管谁赢谁输 残骸都是我们的
No matter the outcome, the spoils will be ours.

237
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,680
杰克 如果你还举棋不定
Well, Jack. If you won't decide

238
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,880
我想就得由女士来选择了
I guess it's lady's choice.

239
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,610
妈妈 对不起
Mom, I'm sorry.

240
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,140
不！
No!

241
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,130
杰克 是你的摩托车吗？
Jack, your motorcycle?

242
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,660
我会解释的 妈妈
I can explain, mom.

243
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,170
等等 我已经解释过了
Wait, I already did.

244
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,870
机械党放跑了打击
MECH lost Breakdown.

245
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,310
可他们连你都看不住吗？
What were the odds they can't hold on to you?

246
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,900
不！杰克！
No! Jack!

247
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,090
妈妈！
Mum!

248
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,520
杰克――！
Jaaaaack!

249
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,330
啊 杰克！
Ah, Jack!

250
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
坚持住 琼
Hang on, June.

251
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,270
瞄准那个大爬虫
Aim for the creepy crawling.

252
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,040
他们是怎么找到这儿的？
How did they find us?

253
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,070
你放我们走 我们谁都不说
You can let us go. We won't tell anyone.

254
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,040
多谢相救 福勒探员
Thanks for coming, Agent Fowler.

255
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,290
早知道还有虎子 我就该叫擎天柱来
If I'd known Con were involved, I would have called in Prime.

256
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,340
恐怕我妈一夜之间 受不了那么多刺激
That might have been too much for mom to handle in one night.

257
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,880
啊！又来这套！
Ah! Not again!

258
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,690
不！
No!

259
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,120
原来是这样的 太有才了
So that's how it's done. Genius.

260
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,510
达比夫人
Mrs Darby

261
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,950
我是特工威廉・福勒
I'm special agent William Fowler.

262
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,640
该让你知道真相了
It's time you knew the truth.

263
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,140
近几个月 杰克一直…在我处实习
For the past several months, Jack's been... interning for me at the agency.

264
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,450
福勒探员 我妈是不会买账的
Agent Fowler, mom's not gonna buy it.

265
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,560
他说对了
He's got that right.

266
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,640
福勒探员
Agent Fowler.

267
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,350
让我猜猜――什么都没留下？
Let me guess-- without a trace?

268
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,600
哼！
Uhh!

269
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,870
那么 她是你的…
And she would be your...

270
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,490
摩托车 保镖 汽车人 朋友
Motorcycle, guardian, Autobot, friend.

271
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,440
叫我阿尔茜好了
Call me Arcee.

272
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,370
谢谢你 阿尔茜
Thank you, Arcee.

273
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,530
看来我可以兑现诺言 带你去兜风了
I think it's time for that ride you once made me promise.

274
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,230
妈妈 这就是我的科幻俱乐部
Mom, meet my science fiction club.
