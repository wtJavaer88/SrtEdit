1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,620
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,090
虎子们回来了
The Cons are back

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,050
飞过山处境非常危险
Cliff might be knee deep in scrap.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,310
飞过山的生命信号…刚刚消失了
Cliffjumper's life signal... just went offline.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,460
时至今日 地球上只剩下我们五个汽车人了
As of today, only we five Autobots remain on this earth.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,310
他们是什么？
What are they?

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,670
会说话的车变的机器人
Talking cars that turn into robots

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,300
或者机器人变的车
or the other way around.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,870
听着 你可能有危险
Look, you maybe in danger

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,450
因为你看到了我们
because you are one of the few

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,230
很少有人知道我们的存在
one of the only who have ever seen us.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,410
你们为什么来地球？
Why are you here?

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,170
保护你们的星球免受威震天的侵害
To protect your planet from Megatron.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,580
但如果他即将东山再起
But if his return is imminent

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,810
又要掀起一场腥风血雨
it could be catastrophic.

16
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,240
我回来了！
I have returned!

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,750
威震天陛下 您不在之时 我们发现了数个能量矿
Of the energon deposits we have located while you're away, Lord Megatron

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,040
而这个矿的储备简直是取之不竭
this one is by far the most significant.

19
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,300
这段时间 机械兵一直在不停地采矿
The drones have been mining without a pause during your absence

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,310
库存量尤为可观
and have amassed quite a stock pile.

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,900
来人啊 给我拿个样本！
You there, fetch me a sample.

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,480
红蜘蛛！
Starscream.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,550
既然我已经回来了
Now that I have returned

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,120
就该由我发号施令
I will issue the commands.

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,330
我…明白 威震天陛下
I… understand, Lord Megatron.

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,090
作为您的忠实奴仆
Then as your humble servant

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,210
我随时准备启动太空桥
shall I ready the Space Bridge

28
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:47,230
迎接这三年来 您在太空组建的霸天虎军队
to bring forth the Decepticon army you have surely gathered during your three years in space?

29
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,690
我的军队会来的
My army will come.

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,720
但我在太空漂流时
But my time away has yielded a more...

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,780
找到一种能够增强实力的神秘方法
intriguing means of materializing them

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,500
这种物质的液体形态
the solidified form of the matter the ancient techs refer to

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,120
在古代资料中被称为――宇宙大帝之血
as the blood of the Unicron.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,550
“毁灭者”宇宙大帝
Unicron the Destroyer.

35
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,450
但据说他的血液跟火种不兼容
But it is said that his blood is the anti-spark.

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,890
“采于宇宙之滨 将得黑暗能量”！
Plucked from cosmic shores, gaze upon Dark Energon.

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,380
传说它威力无比 甚至能…起死回生
Legend tells that it holds the power to... revive the dead.

38
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,810
我们需要找具尸体来试试看
We require only cadaver to be certain.

39
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,030
你愿意做出巨大牺牲吗？
Are you willing to make the ultimate sacrifice?

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,480
这个我看没必要
That may not be necessary.

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,430
请允许我 威震天陛下
If I may, Lord Megatron.

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,190
就当是为您的回归献上的贺礼
Consider it a welcome-home present.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,660
既然你们发现了我们
And since you now know of our existence

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,700
照昨晚的事情来看
I fear that as of the last night

45
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,580
恐怕霸天虎是不会放过你们的
the Decepticons know of yours.

46
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,510
明白 如果看到任何不明车辆 立刻报警
Got it, if we spot any strange vehicles, call 911.

47
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,460
我们可以走了吗？
Can we go now?

48
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,230
你疯了吗？
Are you insane?

49
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,800
这儿对我来说就像天堂一样
I'm living a dream here in Botswana

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,880
你们谁都别想破坏我的美梦！
and I will now allow you or anyone else to shatter it.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,030
你们三个最好接受我们的监护
It is best that you three remain under our watch.

52
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,240
起码我们要弄清楚 敌人有什么意图
At least until we can determine our enemy's intentions.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,580
擎天柱 恕我直言
Optimus, with all due respect

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,510
无论在这里还是别处 这些孩子都同样危险
the human children are in as much danger here as anywhere.

55
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,680
小孩子？
Children?

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,190
他们没有防护罩！
They have no protective shell!

57
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,310
如果不小心被踩到 他们就…扁了
If they get underfoot, they will go… squish.

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,940
那么从现在起 救护车
Then for the time being, Ratchet

59
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,430
我们必须走一步 看一步
we must watch where we step.

60
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,730
那是什么？
What's that?

61
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,660
近程传感器
Proximity sensor.

62
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,920
有人在上面
Someone's up top.

63
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,410
是福勒探员
It's Agent Fowler.

64
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,100
我们不是唯一知道你们的人类吗？
I thought we were the only humans who know about you guys.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,160
特派员福勒是我们和外界之间的特别联络人
Special Agent Fowler is our designated liaison to the outside world.

66
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,180
他来找我们 一定有要事发生
As he tends to visit only when there're issues.

67
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,780
你们最好暂时先别和他见面
It maybe best if you did not meet him at this time.

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,580
七辆车被毁 三十四起剐蹭事故
Seven wrecks, thirty-four fender benders

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,600
三小时交通堵塞
a three hour traffic jam

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
还有一条特别消息
and a particular note:

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,170
多家媒体报道 发现一辆不明车型的高速摩托
numerous reports of a speeding motorcycle of unknown make

72
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,840
和一辆黄黑条纹的肌肉车
and a black & yellow custom muscle car.

73
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,240
那么 你有什么心里话要说吗 擎天柱？
So, anything you care to get off your tin chest, Prime?

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,770
情况尚在我们控制之下 福勒探员
We have the situation under control, Agent Fowler.

75
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,520
他们回来了 是吧？
They're back, aren't they?

76
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,630
如果你指的是霸天虎
If you're referring to the Decepticons

77
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,200
我怀疑他们从未离开过
I have doubts that they ever left.

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,710
你们的星球太有开发价值了
Your planet is much too valuable.

79
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,330
那我现在就要通知五角大楼
Then it's time to wake up the Pentagon.

80
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,850
听我说 福勒探员
Hear me, Agent Fowler.

81
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,820
如果和霸天虎对抗
We're your best

82
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,260
我们也许是你们唯一可以依靠的力量
possibly your only defence against the Decepticon threat.

83
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,120
别太自负
Says you.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,390
嘿 肉条
Hey, fleshy.

85
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,510
有人血溅高速公路吗？
Did anyone get spattered on that freeway?

86
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,630
领袖卫队知道什么时候该用武力
Team Prime knows when to use force

87
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,540
出手的轻重我们心中有数
and how much to use.

88
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,070
隔板 那个我还有用呐！
Bulkhead, I needed that!

89
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,240
够了！
Enough!

90
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,600
军队的干涉只会导致更大的灾难
Military involvement will only result in catastrophe.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,930
或许你可以接受人类尸横遍野 福勒探员
Perhaps you can condone wide spread human casualties, Agent Fowler.

92
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,550
但我 决不能接受
I, however, cannot.

93
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,390
那就为我们双方的利益着想 擎天柱
Then do us both a favour and handle this, Prime

94
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,690
做得…干净点儿
under the radar.

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,250
要么让我来
Or I will.

96
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,930
不自量力
Pretty big bearings…

97
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,300
区区一个人类而已
for a human.

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,040
福勒探员担心的是他的世界 隔板
Agent Fowler has concerns for his world, Bulkhead

99
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,890
这是他的职责
as he should be.

100
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,620
看看源自黑暗的力量
Let us see if power born of darkness

101
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,320
能否重燃火种
can reignite the spark.

102
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,060
那就是你的计划？！
That's your plan?

103
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,440
复活死掉的汽车人 让我们挨揍？
Bring Autobots back from the dead to attack us?

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,320
那已经不再是个汽车人了
That is no longer an Autobot.

105
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,600
只是个没有意识的猛兽
Just a mindless beast

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,170
它唯一的本能就是 摧毁挡在路上的一切
it's only instinct to destroy anything in its path.

107
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,910
看吧 红蜘蛛
There, Starscream

108
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,330
我无坚不摧的军队已经上路 这终极武器…
rise the indestructible seed of my army, the ultimate weapon…

109
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,630
一旦被我掌握 将会大发神威
once I learn to control it.

110
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
该死的地球科技！
Blast that earth tech!

111
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,890
飞过山的信号又出现了
Cliffjumper's signal pop back online.

112
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,420
飞过山是谁？
Who's Cliffjumper?

113
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,290
怎么可能？
How is that possible?

114
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,550
当然不可能
It isn't.

115
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,180
又出故障了
Another bug.

116
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,970
系统故障一大堆
The system is chock-full of them.

117
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,320
飞过山有没有可能还活着？
If there's any chance Cliff's alive?

118
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,140
救护车 准备医务室
Ratchet, prepare sick bay.

119
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,660
可能用得上
We may need it.

120
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,630
我们能做点什么？
what can we do?

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,620
和救护车留守
Remain with Ratchet.

122
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,230
汽车人 出发！
Autobots, roll out!

123
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,140
刚才是怎么回事？
What just happened?

124
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,180
我用环陆桥把他们送到了特定的坐标地点
I transported them to the designated coordinates via the Ground Bridge.

125
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,590
环陆桥是什么？
What's a Ground Bridge?

126
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,410
太空桥技术的简化版而已
Oh... A scale-down version of Space Bridge technology.

127
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:59,080
因为我们现在没有星际旅行需要的设备和能量
Since we don't currently possess the means or the energon required for inter-galactic travel.

128
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,770
你们被困在…
You're stuck here…

129
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,000
地球上了？
on earth?

130
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,310
和你们困在一起 是的
With the likes of you, yes.

131
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,880
但我建造了环陆桥
But I constructed the Ground Bridge

132
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,010
可以到达你们星球的任何角落
to enable travel from here to anywhere on your planet.

133
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,270
人类能用吗？
Whoa, does it work for humans?

134
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,500
当然能
Naturally.

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,680
你是说
You mean I could just

136
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,400
我这么一跳 就能到东京去看我的父母吗？
shoot on over and visit my parents in Tokyo?

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,650
眨眼工夫
Within moments.

138
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,620
这样吧 我马上把你们三个都送过去
In fact, allow me to send you there immediately, all three of you.

139
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,850
说话当心 救护车
Watch it, Ratchet.

140
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,130
能量矿
Energon mine.

141
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,800
照这个规模来看
Judging by its scale

142
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,970
霸天虎应该已经开采过一段时间了
the Decepticons have been tunneling here for quite some time.

143
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,980
我们去找飞过山！
Let's find Cliffjumper.

144
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,760
这是什么玩意儿？
What is this, anyway?

145
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,460
坏了 别碰
Broken, don't touch.

146
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,520
那个也别碰
Don't touch that either.

147
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,330
有什么东西是我们可以碰的吗？
So is there anything we can touch?

148
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,190
你们干嘛要用人类的计算机？
How come you guys are using human computers?

149
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,320
我们别无选择
It certainly isn't by choice.

150
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,670
我们当时接管了这个导弹发射井
It was handed down from the previous talents

151
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,550
这是那些天才留下的
when we inherited this former missile silo.

152
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,890
我根据需要做了一些调整
I made modifications as I see fit.

153
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,100
我想我能把故障修好
I think I can fix that.

154
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,540
真的吗？
Really?

155
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,010
这是超级复杂的科技 知不知道？
You know this is complex technology, don't you?

156
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,730
这可不是儿童玩具！
I mean it isn't a child's toy.

157
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,760
现在试试
Now try.

158
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,690
全速冲击！
Maximum overdrive!

159
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,220
全不费功夫
What an operation.

160
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,280
宇宙大帝之血
Blood of Unicron.

161
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,460
我如何才能揭开你的奥秘
How might I fathom the depth of your mystery

162
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,330
并得以支配你那惊人的力量？
become worthy of wielding your astonishing power.

163
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,410
威震天陛下 矿场出现入侵者
Lord Megatron, intruders have been detected in the mines.

164
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,900
擎天柱？
Optimus?

165
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,480
就是他
Indeed.

166
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,960
我还需要时间
I need more time to prepare on appropriate reception for my old friend.

167
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,960
为老朋友准备一个体面的欢迎仪式
I need more time to prepare on appropriate reception for my old friend.

168
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,910
启动飞船 准备撤离
Ready the ship for departure.

169
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,090
可我挖到的那些能量
But the energon I've mined...

170
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,690
会被汽车人抢走的！
the Autobots will sieze it!

171
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,770
那就把矿炸掉！
Then blow the mines!

172
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,230
是飞过山 我看到了
It's Cliff. I have a visual.

173
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,120
我们掩护你 上吧！
We'll cover you, go!

174
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
飞过山！
Cliff!

175
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,810
我们回家吧 搭档！
Let's get you home, partner!

176
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,720
擎天柱！
Prime!

177
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,060
我也想留下 但我有点洁癖
I'd stick around, but I'm squeamish.

178
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,730
要爆炸了！
The drone is gonna blow!

179
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,740
汽车人 出发！
Autobots, roll out!

180
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
救护车 把我们传送回去
Ratchet, bridge us back.

181
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
使用目的地坐标
Use the arrival coordinates

182
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,310
快！
now!

183
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,730
千钧一发啊
Cutting it a little bit close.

184
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,260
飞过山怎么样了？
How about Cliffjumper?

185
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,100
那爆炸是怎么回事？
What was that explosion?

186
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,180
你们打架了吗？
Was there a fight?

187
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,610
下次我们能去吗？
Can we come with next time?

188
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,390
听着！
Look!

189
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,580
嘿 嘿 神子
Hey, hey, Miko.

190
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,480
我们去看看 他们的抽屉里有什么宝贝
Let's go see what the bots hide in their sock drawers.

191
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,440
真的假的？
Seriously?

192
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,530
阿尔茜 你看到什么了？
Arcee, what did you see?

193
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,630
不是飞过山
Not Cliff.

194
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,320
起码…现在不是了
At least... not anymore.

195
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,230
他被改变了 被分尸
He was mutated, butchered

196
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,260
像大战时虎子做的试验那样
like something from those Con experiments during the war.

197
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,190
我没事 只是有点晕
I'm fine, just dizzy.

198
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,310
机器人也会头晕？
Robots who get dizzy?

199
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
机器人也会难过？
Robots with emotions?

200
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,600
机器人也会死？
Robots... who can die?

201
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,060
这是什么？
What is this?

202
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,660
不知道
Don't know.

203
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,260
飞过山浑身上下都是
Cliff was covered in it

204
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,680
还流了出来
leaking it.

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,750
马上去洗个净化澡 快
Go take a decontamination bath, now.

206
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,200
擎天柱  我不想打扰你 但…这儿没信号
Optimus, I hate to bug, but... no bars.

207
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,350
这是安全措施
A security precaution.

208
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,620
发射井的墙壁阻断了所有无线电波
The silo walls isolate all radio waves.

209
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,820
如果我现在不打电话给我妈妈
Well, if I don't call my mom like now

210
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,990
我敢肯定 警察会开始找我的
I'm pretty sure the cops will be out looking for me.

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,390
你犯过法吗？
Have you broken the law?

212
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,950
噢 是宵禁
Oh, curfew

213
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,320
已经晚上十点多了
it's after 10pm.

214
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,250
我也该回家了
I'd better get home, too

215
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,260
否则我一年都别想出门
or I'll be grounded for a year.

216
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,290
地球风俗
Earth customs

217
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,160
是我考虑不周
I hadn't considered.

218
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,400
但还是要保证你们的安全
But the issue of your safety remains.

219
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,470
隔板 送神子回家
Bulkhead, accompany Miko home.

220
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,080
太棒了！吓死我的监护人！
Awesome! My host parents will freak!

221
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,270
保持伪装形态进行监视
And maintain covert surveillance in vehicle form.

222
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,350
在路边望风 明白
Curbside duty, got it.

223
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,880
大黄蜂 你来照顾拉夫
Bumblebee, you'll watch over Raf.

224
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,960
救护车…
Ratchet...

225
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,020
忙着呢！
Busy!

226
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,530
阿尔茜 你护送杰克
Arcee, you'll accompany Jack.

227
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,930
噢 我还是晕
Oh, still dizzy.

228
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,320
医生说你没事了
You're fine, says your physician.

229
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,330
阿尔茜 我只想说
Arcee, I just wanted to say

230
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,960
对于你的损失 我真的很遗憾
I'm really sorry for your loss.

231
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,380
你能理解什么叫损失吗？
What could you possibly know about loss?

232
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,800
怎么？你以为只有你才有心事吗？
What? You think you're the only one with problems?

233
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,000
泡妞失败算什么心事！
I'm not sure girl-trouble counts!

234
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,620
我敢说 我泡妞失败 正因为那晚碰见了你
I'm pretty sure my girl-trouble started the night I met you.

235
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,220
虎子！
Cons!

236
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,850
不！是我妈
No! Mom.

237
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,430
杰克？
Jack?

238
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,180
妈妈！别激动 我可以解释
Mom! Don't freak, I can explain.

239
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,260
你能吗？
Can you?

240
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,600
杰克逊・达比 我们已经谈过这个了
Jackson Darby, we've talked about this.

241
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,960
我知道 那个…
I know, and...

242
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,210
你不懂
You don't know.

243
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,240
你不知道 你不在家时 我已经够担心了
I worred about you enough when you were not here.

244
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,600
我现在还要担心你骑摩托出事吗？
Now I have to worry about you driving a motorcycle?

245
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,870
我已经十六岁了
I'm sixteen.

246
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,280
不可能永远骑十变速自行车
I can't be riding a ten speed forever.

247
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,180
你哪来的钱买这个？
How did you even afford this?

248
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,110
是二手货
It's used.

249
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,250
挺破的 真的
It's abused, really

250
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,180
需要大修
needs a ton of repairs.

251
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
但其实…
But the point is...

252
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,110
买头盔的时候 我还是小孩
I may have been a kid when I bought this

253
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,180
但我已经长大了
but I'm not anymore.

254
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,920
你经常教育我 做选择要负责任
You always tell me to make responsible choices.

255
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,680
现在 我选择了她
Well, I chose her.

256
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,030
我会负责的
And I'll be responsible.

257
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,410
我发誓
I promise.

258
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,080
“她”？
"Her"?

259
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,080
我觉得你还不能把女孩子带回家过夜
I don't think you could be bringing girls home just yet.

260
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,650
我…觉得是她带我回来的
I'd... like to think she brought me.

261
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,450
好吧 很高兴你终于有理由戴头盔了
Well, I'm glad you finally have a reason to wear your helmet

262
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,920
每次骑车都要戴！
every single time you ride.

263
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,600
你得先跟我打招呼才行
You... will take me for a spin every once in a while?

264
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,820
看情况吧
We'll see.

265
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,920
她的脾气不太好
She's kind a temperamental.

266
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,670
嘘 你疯了吗？
Shhh, are you crazy?

267
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,370
会吵醒我妈妈的！
You'll wake up my mom!

268
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,140
去拿头盔 是时候上路了
Grab your helmet, it's go time.

269
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,080
今天是星期六啊！
Oh... It's Saturday!

270
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,910
你可以在基地陪大黄蜂看动画片
You can watch cartoons back at base with Bumblebee.

271
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,570
动画片…我都十六岁了
Cartoons? I'm sixteen.

272
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,330
留个纸条给你妈妈 不然她会担心的
And leave a note for your mom. She worries.

273
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,780
我看您不必再担心汽车人的骚扰了 主人
I don't think you need to worry further Autobot interference, master.

274
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,440
擎天柱已经完蛋了
Not with Optimus gone.

275
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,750
你说这话有什么证据吗？
And what evidence do you possess of this fact?

276
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,990
我炸掉了矿场
I destroyed the mines

277
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,800
按您的指示
as you instructed.

278
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,590
消灭擎天柱没那么容易
Optimus is not so easily destroyed.

279
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,450
我们之间千万年的战斗就可以证明
We have millennia worth of battles behind this to prove it.

280
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,900
或许您该休整一下 陛下
Maybe you should take a break, my Lord.

281
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,410
我担心 过度和黑暗能量接触
I worry that too much contact with the Dark Energon

282
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,030
会对您产生某种…负面影响
might allow its properties to adversely affect you.

283
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,380
其实 红蜘蛛
Or perhaps, Starscream

284
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,440
我可能还没接触够呢！
I have not permitted myself contact enough!

285
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,310
等等！威震天陛下 不！
Wait! Lord Megatron, no!

286
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,310
别拿您的火种室冒险！
Not your spark chamber!

287
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,540
您不知道会有什么后果！
You do not know what it will do!

288
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,030
这种粘液的基本元素 我从没见过
The base elements of this goo are like nothing I've ever encountered.

289
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,070
阿尔茜的症状发展迅速
It must be extremely concentrated

290
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,530
说明它一定是高度浓缩的
to have affected Arcee so rapidly.

291
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,170
可惜
Unfortunately

292
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,370
缺少合适的诊断工具
complete results are slow coming

293
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,150
完整分析慢得要死
without the use of proper diagnostic tools.

294
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,800
全都怪你 隔板！
Thank you very much, Bulkhead!
