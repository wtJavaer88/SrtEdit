1
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,760
隔板
Bulkhead

2
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,690
你我二人在这个鬼地方居然也会相遇
imagine you and I bumping into each other in the middle of 

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,100
都怪那个该死的能量信号
nowhere while tracking a stray energon signal.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,030
没错 打击
Yea, Breakdown

5
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,320
今天是你的幸运日
it must be your lucky day.

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,620
你的人类小宠物在哪儿？
Where is your pet human?

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,270
等我消灭你之后 再去拜访她如何？
How about when I finish with you, I'll pay her a visit?

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,940
戳到你的软肋了么？
So the wrecker's got a soft spot.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,090
短暂的重逢让我终生难忘…
As much as I'll miss our little reunions...

10
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,980
这一锤送你上路！
... hammer time.

11
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,660
长官 以我们现有的运力 只能带走一个
Sir, we only have the resources to transport one.

12
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,400
带走那个打赢的
Take the victor.

13
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,820
“马可” “马可”
Marco. Marco.

14
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,250
“马可”！
Marco!

15
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,250
神子？
Miko?

16
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,540
哼…你应该接着说“波罗”！
Hmmm... You're supposed to say "Polo"!

17
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,820
呃？
Eh?

18
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,100
神子 跟救护车说 我需要环陆桥
Miko, let Ratchet know I need a Ground Bridge.

19
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,540
单枪匹马独自迎敌 只是匹夫之勇 隔板
Engaging the enemy on your own was foolish, Bulkhead.

20
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,360
打击偷袭我
Breakdown jumped me.

21
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,770
我就知道他不行 啊！
I knew I could take 'em. Ugha!

22
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,220
别乱动
Stay still.

23
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,750
看那家伙的惨状就知道了 对吧 小隔？
But we should see the other guy, right, Bulk?

24
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,110
呃 对了 关于这个…
Uh, yea, about that...

25
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,120
你没能消灭他？
You didn't torch him?

26
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,500
不完全是
Not exactly.

27
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,340
我以为是你们干的
I figured you all did.

28
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,190
哦…
Oh...

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,930
我醒来时 打击已经…不在了
When I came to, Breakdown was, just gone.

30
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,350
我记得有直升机的声音
I remember hearing a copter.

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,330
可能是福勒探员把他带走了？
Maybe it was Agent Fowler?

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,650
不是我
Not me.

33
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,670
但我猜到是谁了
But I have an idea who.

34
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,210
告诉我“绑虎事件”发生的位置
Show me where this Con-napping occurred.

35
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,480
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

36
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,540
打击现在下落不明
I fear Breakdown has gone missing.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,410
是汽车人干的吗？
The Autobots?

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,950
根据那个精准无比的声波 提供的监视资料
According to surveillance provided by the astonishingly accurate Soundwave

39
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,740
绑架打击的是人类
Breakdown was abducted by humans.

40
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,170
你想说什么？
You point?

41
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,900
我强烈建议
My strongest recommendation

42
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,600
组建一支救援队 把那群自讨苦吃的害虫消灭干净！
we assemble a rescue team to hunt the vermin responsible for this outrage.

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,690
让打击自生自灭吧
Breakdown is on his own.

44
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,660
啊？呃…
Hah? Eh...

45
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,120
主人的意思是？
Master?

46
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,300
如果打击轻易落在比他弱小的人类手中
If Breakdown allowed himself to be captured by those smaller than him

47
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,260
如果打击轻易落在比他弱小的人类手中
weaker than him

48
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,390
那只能说他气数已尽了
he deserves whatever fate awaits him.

49
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,800
但少了打击这个核心成员 我们…
But Breakdown is a key player in our, eh...

50
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,650
您的智慧毋庸置疑 威震天陛下…
Your wisdom reigns supreme, Lord Megatron...

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,430
…暂时的
... for now.

52
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,290
什么？
What?

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
肮脏的肉球！
Filthy fleshlings

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,010
你以为你们是谁？
who do you think you are?

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,870
我们是机械党
We are MECH

56
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,020
而我 就是塞拉斯
and I, am Silas.

57
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,630
立即放了我 我可以留你们一条生路
Release me now and I will let you live.

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,700
抱歉 对我们而言 你可是无价之宝
I'm afraid you are far too valuable to us.

59
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,640
呵呵 威震天从来不付赎金
Hehe, Megatron will never pay a ransom.

60
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,140
哦 你误会了
Oh, you misunderstand.

61
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,680
我们要的不是赎金
We don't want a ransom.

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,470
而是你
We want only you.

63
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,420
你的整个身体
All of you.

64
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,270
这就是我们发现隔板的地方
This is where we picked up Bulkhead.

65
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,910
位于俄罗斯东部的堪察加半岛
The Kamchatka Peninsula in Eastern Russia.

66
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,880
二十年前首次火山喷发后 大部分地区被遗弃
Much of it was abandoned twenty years ago when its volcano first erupted.

67
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,940
我有情报 今天早些时候 那里曾有机械党出没
My intel reported MECH activity there earlier today.

68
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,430
机械党？你是指那群技术狂人？
MECH? You mean those techy guys?

69
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,100
那些人知道我们就在这个星球上
The very ones who know of our existence on your planet.

70
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,960
他们一定跟踪了我们
They must have tracked one of us there.

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
但他们带走打击 目的何在？
But what would they want with Breakdown?

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,760
这有什么？让他们放心走吧
What's it matter? They can have him.

73
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,630
呵 是啊 被人类拖走了 哈！
Heh, yea. Dragged off by humans, Ha!

74
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,840
我也算是为人类做了善事 对吧？
Guess I softened him up for 'em, huh?

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,540
不害臊…
Nya...

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,250
救护车 重新激活环陆桥的上一个坐标
Ratchet, reactivate the previous Ground Bridge coordinates.

77
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,610
我们要营救打击
We will rescue Breakdown.

78
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,100
什么？
What?

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,370
擎天柱 你在开玩笑吧？
Optimus, you can't be serious.

80
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,940
机械党把他拆了才好呢
MECH can melt him down for all I care.

81
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,960
让虎子们自己去救人吧
Let the Cons rescue their own.

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,460
威震天从来不会在乎一个手下的性命
It is unlikely that Megatron would bother with an errand of mercy.

83
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,330
好吧 可我们干嘛要去救打击
OK. But this is Breakdown we are talking about.

84
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,330
有时候 为了顾全大局 我们必须看远一点
Sometimes we must rise above ourselves for the greater good.

85
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,430
噢 这话什么意思？
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

86
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,960
打击会心怀感激 幡然悔悟 然后弃暗投明？
Breakdown's gotta be grateful and go all soft and join the cause?

87
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,910
尽管霸天虎改邪归正的可能性不大
While it is unlikely that any Decepticon will choose the path of good

88
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,260
但他们毕竟有改变命运的潜力
even they possess the potential for change.

89
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,650
切！我就知道你又要说教了
Neh! I knew where this was headed.

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,750
我说的顾全大局
By greater good

91
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,360
是指人类
I meant human kind.

92
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,780
机械党是目前最明确的威胁
MECH presents a clear and present danger.

93
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,740
擎天柱说的对
Prime's right.

94
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,880
大个子
Two time.

95
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,640
机械党正四处搜取最具突破性的科技
We know MECH is obssessed with obtaining ground-breaking technology.

96
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,350
所以我们不能让塞博特恩生物科技
Which means we cannot allow Cybertronian biology

97
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,440
落入他们的手中
to fall into their hands.

98
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,670
开门见山
Full disclosure

99
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,500
我们打算把你肢解
we intend to pull you apart.

100
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,920
给你一个“打击”
Break you down

101
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
怎么说都行
if you will.

102
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,880
我们会利用所发现的一切 研发新一代武器
And we will utilize whatever we discover to develop a new generation of weaponary.

103
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,570
恐怕你不会活到解体完成
I'm afraid that you won't survive the process.

104
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,330
所以我要提前感谢你的无私奉献
So thank you in advance for your sacrifice.

105
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,120
机械党会牢记这份人情的
MECH is very much in your debt.

106
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,070
你正在犯一个天大的错误 小不点儿
You're making a very big mistake, little man.

107
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,260
我要把你干掉 让他们从地板上拼凑你的尸体！
When I'm finished with you, they'll have to scrape you off the floor!

108
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,070
你显然不会晕血
Since you evidently aren't squeamish

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,920
所以我让你观赏全程
I'll allow you to watch.

110
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,320
他的痛觉感受器都关闭了吗？
Are his pain receptors disabled?

111
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,000
很好 这样他就不会大呼小叫了
Good, then he won't make as much noise.

112
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,170
拆开他
Open him up.

113
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,310
别这样 小隔
Come on, Bulk

114
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,200
你应该一起去
you got to go with.

115
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,960
我就是不去
Don't wanna.

116
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,220
隔板
Bulkhead.

117
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,910
大哥 抱歉
Optimus, I'm sorry.

118
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,370
这种事我做不了
I just can't do it.

119
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,200
我支持你的选择
I support your choice.

120
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,490
- 什…什么？\N- 什么？
- Wh-wh-what?\N- What?

121
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,490
考虑到你和打击之间的恩怨
Given your history with Breakdown

122
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,250
你的判断力可能会受到影响
your judgement maybe clouded

123
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,620
这对任务有弊无利
and thus jeopardize the mission.

124
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,870
另外
Besides

125
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,950
那名霸天虎更需要的是医生 而不是战士
the Decepticon maybe more in need of a medic than another warrior.

126
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,030
我准备好了 擎天柱
Locked and loaded, Optimus.

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,340
汽车人 出发！
Autobots, roll out!

128
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,820
好吧 祝你们马到成功
Fine, happy hunting.

129
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,950
呃！
Uh!

130
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,610
呃 你想干点啥？
Uh, what do you see?

131
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,750
怪兽电影两集连放？
Creature double feature?

132
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,270
随便你
Sure.

133
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,150
哇哦 算我一个
Whooa, I'm in.

134
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,940
没有生命迹象
No signs of life.

135
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,710
人类和塞博特恩人的都没有
Human or Cybertronian.

136
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,260
别管那些胎痕了 大黄蜂
Forget the tracks, Bumblebee.

137
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,370
我收到一个微弱的能量信号 西北偏北方向 约四分钟路程
I'm picking up a faint energon signal three kliks north by northwest.

138
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,850
是打击
Breakdown.

139
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,200
但我们应该收不到他的信号 除非…
But we shouldn't be getting a reading, unless...

140
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,880
他的能量泄漏了
His energon's been spilled.

141
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,540
“哥斯拉大战五头猿”
Dinolizard vs. Five-Headed Ape

142
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,470
你要错过大场面了
you are missing the smack down.

143
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,070
不 错过大场面的是你
No, you are missing the smack down

144
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,330
气死我了
which stinks

145
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,940
打击是你的老对手
'cause Breakdown is your arch-enemy

146
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,150
不是擎天柱的
not Optimus's

147
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,270
更不是机械党的
and definitely not MECH's.

148
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,950
唉…神子 你不懂
Hugh... Miko, you don't understand.

149
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,490
打击和我
Breakdown and me

150
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,240
我们有很深的过节
we go way back.

151
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,980
你不知道 他干过什么坏事
You have no idea the things he's done.

152
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,460
我绝不会去救他 明白吗？
I am not rescuing him OK?

153
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,420
这次不会 以后也没门儿！
Not now, not ever!

154
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,320
 我没让你去英雄救美男 小隔
Dah, you don't need to bromance him, Bulk.

155
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,090
你需要的是打败他！
You just need to beat him!

156
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,340
呃 什么？
Uh, what?

157
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,000
不救他 你就没机会揍他了
No rescue, no rematch.

158
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,780
走这边
This way.

159
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,080
信号就来自…
Readings coming from right...

160
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,540
…这里
... here.

161
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,230
打击的眼睛
Breakdown's eye.

162
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,770
是机械党
MECH.

163
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,140
你要干嘛？
What are you doing?

164
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,090
视觉接收器可能保存了最后收到的影像
The optic receptors might have retained the final image received.

165
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,450
你猜怎么着？
What do you know?

166
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,120
科学怪人又赢了
Weird science wins again.

167
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,260
哦…
Oh...

168
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,350
哎呀呀 擎天柱
Well, well, Optimus Prime.

169
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,590
很高兴又“亲眼”见到你了
A pleasure to "set eyes" on you again.

170
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,530
他把视学接收器改为双向传输了
He's converted the optics to a two-way feed.

171
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,320
你一定就是塞拉斯
And you must be Silas.

172
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,980
正是本人
In the flesh.

173
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,430
但由于我的俘虏不是你的人
But being that our captive is not one of yours.

174
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,790
我得承认
I have to admit

175
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,210
我以为来的会是…
I was expecting...

176
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,650
…威震天
... Megatron.

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,370
在当前状况下
In this circumstance

178
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,640
汽车人和霸天虎有了共同的敌人
Autobots and Decpticons share a common foe.

179
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,600
机械党跟你们那些敌人没有共同点！
MECH is anything but common.

180
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,710
我们的客人提供了大量 关于机械生命体的信息
Our guest is yielding quite a bit of information about your bio-mechanics

181
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,250
正如你们所见
as you can see.

182
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,410
可惜打击自己看不大清楚了
Although Breakdown himself can't see so well any more.

183
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,230
我们不怕你！
We don't fear you!

184
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
噢 你们早晚会怕的
Oh, but you should.

185
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,510
实际上 我强烈建议 你们别站得太死板了
In fact, I would strongly urge that you not stand your ground.

186
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,310
这是个陷阱！
It's a trap!

187
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,450
既然这样 你是不是该喊“出发”了？
Would this be a "roll out" kind of trap?

188
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,280
火速撤离！
Evacuate now!

189
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,790
好了 谁知道他们把打击的零件藏在哪儿了？
So, any idea where they're keeping the rest of Breakdown?

190
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,860
手术过程好看吗？
Enjoying the view?

191
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,090
真是讽刺 你的救星现在可能死无全尸了
Ironically your would-be rescuers may be in more pieces than you right now.

192
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,540
霸天虎没那么不堪一击！
Decpticons don't break that easy!

193
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,210
我可没说他们是霸天虎
Who said they were Decpticons?

194
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,870
那不可能
That doesn't make sense

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,620
汽车人怎么会来救我
Autobots wouldn't come to rescue me.

196
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,830
“马可”！
Marco!

197
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,210
你应该接着说“波罗”！
You're supposed to say "Polo"!

198
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,520
又来了个送死的
More grist for the mill.

199
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,310
今天是你的幸运日
It must be your lucky day.

200
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,290
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

201
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,930
救你出去
Getting you outta here.

202
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,500
没错 我也觉得太离谱
Yea, I don't believe it either.

203
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,950
你还能走么？
Can you walk?

204
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,060
呃 应该能
Uh, I think so.

205
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,560
能跑么？
Can you run?

206
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,690
要死战到底 决不逃跑！
Never run when you can fight!

207
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,110
别用那玩意儿对着我 好么？
Just keep that thing pointed away from me, alright?

208
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,260
怪兽二人组杀过来喽！
Creature double feature coming at you!

209
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,060
你有逃跑的计划吗？
You have some sort of escape plan?

210
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,470
有 但不合你的口味
Yea, but you're not gonna like it.

211
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,640
隔板呼叫擎天柱
Bulkhead to Optimus

212
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,240
到我的坐标处集合
Rendezvous to my coordinates

213
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,620
我需要支援
I'm in need of backup.

214
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,020
长官 不明敌机正在接近
Sir, incoming bogies.

215
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,470
所有单位注意
All units

216
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,040
撤出战斗 执行欧米加方案
disengage and initiate Omega Protocols.

217
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,150
是你的援兵吗？
Your backup?

218
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,970
红蜘蛛指挥官！
Commander Starscream.

219
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,100
居然和敌人私通？打击啊
Counsulting with the enemy, Breakdown?

220
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,800
是隔板救我出来的
But Bulkhead got me out of there.

221
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,700
我的火种充满感激之情 汽车人
Many spark felt thanks, Autobot.

222
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,560
现在消灭他
Now destory him.

223
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,740
但是…
But you...

224
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,260
你打算过几天加入他们的队伍吗？
Do you plan on joining their ranks anytime soon?

225
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,140
不想吧？那就跟他们划清界限！
No? Then be done with them already!

226
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,700
很不幸 隔板
Tough break, Bulkhead

227
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,750
此恩来生再报
maybe the next life.

228
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,390
消灭他！啊！
Destory him! Ah!

229
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,580
这一锤送你们上路！
Hammer time!

230
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,760
来啊 我把你们全都砸成碎片！
Come on, I'll scrap all of you!

231
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,760
撤退！
Ahh... Retreat!

232
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,390
你单枪匹马独自迎敌 比上次还要鲁莽 隔板
Engaging the enemy on your own was even more foolish this time, Bulkhead.

233
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,520
但是
But

234
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,250
我很欣慰 你能顾全大局 营救自己的对头
I am honored that you saw fit to rescue your rival.

235
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,770
你真的比以前成长了许多
You have truely risen above yourself.

236
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,810
你们看到了吗
Did you see

237
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,380
我赢了打击 还用他的铁锤狠狠揍了他们一顿！
I beat Breakdown and bashed them all with his own hammer!

238
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,300
这次复赛我赢了！
I won the rematch!

239
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,580
神子一定会为你感到骄傲的
I'm sure Miko would be proud.

240
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,110
总有一天 你要还我一个人情 打击
One day, you will repay you debt to me, Breakdown

241
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,720
到时候 你可要选对立场！
the day it comes time to choose sides.

242
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,730
呃 在轮子和虎子之间吗？
Uh, between Bots and Cons?

243
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,550
在我本人和威震天之间
Between myself and Megatron.

244
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,280
顺便说一句
Incidentally

245
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,140
我建议你不要向威震天提起这次拯救行动
I suggest that Megatron never know of this rescue.

246
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,710
你也想让他觉得 是你自己打败那些小不点儿的
You do what him to think you overcame the puny humans on your own

247
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,060
没错吧？
don't you?

248
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,780
试验品逃走了
The test subject escaped

249
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,220
但我们及时清理了现场
but we managed to sanitize the location and transfer

250
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,320
并将刚刚得到的数据 转移到了另一处基地
most of the newly acquired data to another facility.

251
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,890
对试验品各关键部件的详细扫描
Our diagnostic scans of the subject's vital components

252
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,690
（Chimera 奇美拉  希腊神话中狮头、羊身、蛇尾的吐火怪物)
were thorough enough for us to initiate Project Chimera.

253
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,690
足以让我们启动奇美拉计划
were thorough enough for us to initiate Project Chimera.

254
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,420
（Chimera 奇美拉  希腊神话中狮头、羊身、蛇尾的吐火怪物)
The power of the living mechines will

255
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,420
这些活体机器的力量
The power of the living mechines will

256
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,050
不日之后
some day soon

257
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,510
将属于机械党！
belong to MECH.
