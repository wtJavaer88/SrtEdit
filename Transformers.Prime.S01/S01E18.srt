1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,330
阿尔茜 有车辆接近
Arcee, a vehicular form is approaching.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,400
霸天虎吗？
Decepticon?

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,070
是我妈…
Huh... Mom...

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,740
又来了？
Again?

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,330
她担心我
She worries.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,000
嗨 甜心
Hi, honey.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,440
嘿 呃…
Hey, eh...

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,850
医院提前下班 所以我想顺便来看看
Finished my shift early at the hospital, so I thought I'd swing by.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,610
很高兴再见到你 医生
Good to see you again, doctor.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,750
阿尔茜
Arcee.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,740
对了 擎天柱在哪儿？
So, where is Optimus?

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,220
跟大黄蜂一起执行巡逻任务
On a scouting mission with Bumblebee.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,820
对不起让你扑空了
Sorry to disappoint.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,830
我难得穿一次高跟鞋…
And I wore heels and everything...

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,080
妈妈！
Mom!

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,560
真奇怪
That's odd.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,000
这种磁通量在任何一个星球上都…极其罕见
This is an extremely unusual magnetic flux... for any planet.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,750
我认识这种磁力特征 声波
I recognize this magnetic signature, Soundwave.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,760
这项霸天虎的发明要是落入敌手 可就太不幸了
And it would be unfortunate to have a Decepticon invention such as this used against us.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,910
我会取回这件武器 威震天陛下
I will secure the weapon, Lord Megatron.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,310
打击？哈！
Breakdown? Hah!

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,290
你连区区人类都敌不过 还想对抗汽车人？
If you can be bested by mere humans, what chance do you have against the Autobots?

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,660
请允许我戴罪立功 主人
Allow me to redeem myself, master.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,940
我所受到的羞辱 时刻提醒着我 决不再辜负您
What I have lost is a constant reminder that I must never again fail you.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,790
感觉到最后转弯产生的超重了吗？
Hahahahaha... Did you feel the Gs on that last turn?

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,170
隔板开车太猛了！
Bulkhead's an animal!

27
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,510
我记得 这里是个秘密俱乐部吧？
Remember when this used to be a secret club house?

28
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,940
呃 别担心 达比小姐 我们系了安全带
Eh, don't worry, Miss Darby. We were wearing seatbelts.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,030
我相信你 拉斐尔
I'm sure you were, Rafael.

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,190
嗨 神子！学校里怎么样？
Hi, Miko! How's school going?

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,140
什么？你听说什么了？
Why? What you hear?

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,000
我们得干活了 杰克
Let's do this thing, Jack.

33
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,200
可是 我刚到 我带了三明治喔
But, I just got here. I brought sandwiches.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
妈妈 我真得去帮阿尔茜 测试升级后的追踪系统
Mom. Look, I really need to help Arcee test her upgraded tracking system.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,280
好吧 只是 要小心
Well, just be careful.

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,240
没什么可小心的 只不过是例行检查
There's nothing to be careful about. It's a routine diagnostic.

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,780
你非得让杰克帮忙吗？
Are you sure you need Jack for that?

38
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,360
啊哦
Eh-oh...

39
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,140
隔板 你得再出趟外勤 调查一个诡异的磁力扰动
Bulkhead, I need you back in the field to investigate an odd magnetic disturbance.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,920
我也要去！
I'll go with!

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,890
喔 好好待着 神子
Whoa, stay put, Miko.

42
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,640
你怎么不跟他去？
Why aren't you going with him?

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,720
某人觉得不安全
Someone thinks it's not safe.

44
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,040
那杰克跟着阿尔茜就安全了？
But it's safe for Jack to go with Arcee?

45
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,160
妈妈 这完全是两码事
Mom, totally different.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,370
噢 说来听听
Oh, how?

47
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,320
妈妈是为你好 杰克
Mother knows best, Jack.

48
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,250
等等 隔板 我跟你去
Wait up, Bulkhead. I'm going with.

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,710
啊 我说什么来着？
Ah, what did I say?

50
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,460
中奖了
Jackpot.

51
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,810
我觉得 你不该独吞…
For me, you shouldn't have...

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,370
我没有
I didn't.

53
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,410
我听说虎子出了个败类
I heard a rumour about a rogue 'Con.

54
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,440
要不要我把你五花大绑 捉拿归案？
How about I hogtie you and haul you in?

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,810
哼 头脑简单 四肢发达
Huh, the primitive type.

56
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,520
独眼龙看不清目标距离 是吗？
Not much for depth perception any more, are you?

57
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,990
八角怪还有脸说别人！
Or not much for looks anymore.

58
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,520
葬礼真感人
It was a lovely burial.

59
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,820
不好意思 你说什么我听不清
Sorry, can't quite understand you.

60
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,690
那不是针对你 阿尔茜
Don't take it so personal, Arcee.

61
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,260
杰克的母亲只是…有保护欲望
Jack's mother's just... protective.

62
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,850
可她不知道 这几个月我一直在保护她儿子
Well, I protected her son for months before she had a clue.

63
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,180
等她恍然大悟之后…
Suddenly she wakes up to reality and...

64
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,160
又觉得我不够好
I'm not enough.

65
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,310
没错！
No kidding!

66
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,440
我们能不能拒绝她来基地？
Can't we ban her from the base?

67
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,200
神子 你怎么…
Miko, how did you...

68
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
呼叫环陆桥
Gonna need a bridge.

69
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,980
等等 别把我送回那个护仔老妈手里
Wait, don't send me back to helicopter mom.

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,550
我只是…怀念以前的时光
It's just... I miss the way things were.

71
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,700
取消呼叫 救护车
Strike that, Ratchet.

72
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,730
继续巡逻 还是让她跟着我们吧
It's only recon. She's safe with us.

73
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,690
太好了！
S-weet!

74
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,780
劲爆第七曲 小隔
Crank up track 7, Bulk.

75
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,460
什么第七曲？
Track 7?

76
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,490
你不觉得 这样巡逻太吵了吗？
Do you think that's a little loud for a recon?

77
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,060
侦察兵应该能杀人于无形
A scout should be silent but deadly.

78
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,060
（“杀人于无形”在美国日常生活中用于描述 “响屁不臭，臭屁不响”）
A scout should be silent but deadly.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,710
怎么？
What?

80
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,670
（“杀人于无形”在美国日常生活中用于描述 “响屁不臭，臭屁不响”）
Silent but deadly means something completely different on earth.

81
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,670
“杀人于无形”在地球上说的完全是另一回事
Silent but deadly means something completely different on earth.

82
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,360
小隔 我们继续巡逻吧
Bulk, let's get our recon on.

83
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,910
一向都是我领头的
I always take point.

84
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,210
我知道 可是神子喜欢打前哨 可以看风景
I know, but Miko likes to be at front so she can see.

85
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,960
不管到哪儿 我都是电灯泡
No matter where I turn, I'm the third wheel.

86
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,870
嗯…看来救护车说的磁通量就来自…
Hmm... looks like Ratchet's magnetic flux is coming from...

87
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,710
毒蜘蛛
Airachnid...

88
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,910
还有打击
And Breakdown.

89
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,200
正好是你们俩的宿敌
Both your arch enemies.

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,580
他们在窝里斗
And they're mashing it up.

91
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,870
为了抢那个
Over that.

92
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
那就是磁力扰动的来源
The source of the magnetic disturbance.

93
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,780
很好 有什么计划？
Alright, what's the plan?

94
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,560
神子 别动 我是认真的
Miko, don't move. I mean it.

95
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,460
阿尔茜 看呐 你带来一个新搭档让我开荤
Arcee. And look, you brought a new partner for me to snuff.

96
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,400
那是隔板
That would be Bulkhead.

97
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,660
谁问你了？
Who asked you?

98
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,670
人间大炮
Launch me.

99
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,680
不 她是我的
No, she's mine.

100
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,160
- 小心那个…\N- 明白
- Watch out for ...\N- Got it.

101
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,360
哇哦 他们俩是绝配
Wow. They're really good together.

102
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,530
嗯 照下来放进纪念册
Ugh... Smack down for the scrap book.

103
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,360
啊…谢谢
Ah... Thank you.

104
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,990
你会用那东西吗？
Do you even know what that does?

105
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,540
那可不是玩具！
It isn't a toy.

106
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,040
嘿！
Hey!

107
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,880
嘿！
Hey!

108
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,020
怎么回…
What's going...

109
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,680
哼哼…这个开关是干嘛的？
Hmhmhmm... What's this switch do?

110
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,090
威震天一定喜欢这东西
Megatron's gonna love this.

111
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,750
隔板！
Bulkhead!

112
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,000
虎子们逃跑了
The Cons are getting away.

113
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,840
嘿 我的手机！
Hey, my phone!

114
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,190
粘住了！
It's stuck!

115
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,290
阿尔茜呢？
Where is Arcee?

116
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,890
你干脆跟她结婚好了
Why don't you just marry her?

117
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,660
我就在你后面
I'm right behind you.

118
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,470
哪儿？
Where?

119
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,730
你应该…不用担心后院起火了
Let's just say... she's got your back.

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,570
见鬼
Scrap.

121
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,160
我是打击 我需要传送…
Breakdown here. I'm gonna need a bridge...

122
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,110
你们被磁力吸到了一起？
You've been magnetized... together?

123
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,210
呃 他们亲密无间
Uh... They're inseparable.

124
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,200
而且那个磁力装置就要被威震天拿到手了
And the device that did this is on its way to Megatron.

125
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,970
极化拳套 一项看似简单实则恐怖的发明
A polarity gauntlet. A deceptively simple but diabolical creation.

126
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,890
你到底能不能把我们分开 救护车
Just tell me you can unhitch us, Ratchet.

127
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,010
从目前的引力状况来看 可能只是残余的…磁力作用
It may simply be a residual magnetic charge, providing your current attraction.

128
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,640
他们俩不仅仅是吸引！
They are not attracted to each other.

129
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,120
恐怕抵消这个作用的最佳方案 是夺回拳套
But I'm afraid retrieving the gauntlet is our surest bet for reversing its effect.

130
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,280
威震天一旦拿到了这个拳套…
Once Megatron gets his hands on the gauntlet...

131
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,500
肯定不会只用它 在冰箱上贴便签和家庭照片
He'll use it for a whole lot more than attaching notes and family photos to the fridge.

132
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,580
杰克？我没听明白
Jack? I'm not following.

133
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,990
女士 我们是用合金铸造的
Madam, we are forged of metal alloy.

134
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,890
如果威震天按动开关就能把我们击退 我们可能再也没机会打败他了
If Megatron could repel us with a flick of the switch, we might never again have another shot at him.

135
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,970
瞬间力场
Instant force field.

136
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,170
更不用说 他可以用那东西把我们压成一堆废铁
Worse yet, he might use it to meld us all into a scrap pile.

137
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,680
好消息是 那个拳套还没走远
The good news is the gauntlet hasn't travelled far.

138
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,460
我强烈建议你们追上去
I would strongly advise pursuit.

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,780
四个轮子 很快就到了
We can catch up fast on wheels.

140
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,620
喔 喔 喔！你想把我折成两半吗？
Whoa, whoa, whoa! And snap me in half?

141
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,460
哦 对…
Right...

142
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,450
太棒了！
S-weet!

143
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,170
我来领头
I'll take point.

144
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,650
这次不行 小鬼
Not this time, kid.

145
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,950
什么？可是你说过…
What? But you said...

146
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,690
当时是巡逻 现在是战斗
That was recon. This is war.

147
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,780
我不能用你的安全冒险 你今天的历险到此为止
I'm not risking your well-being just so you can hit your daily adrenaline quota.

148
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,040
救护车 神子需要环陆桥
Ratchet, Miko needs a bridge.

149
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,770
就来
Coming up.

150
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,520
呃！杰克的妈妈就够烦人了 可你说话跟她一样！
Ugh! You think Jack's mom's bad? You sound just like her.

151
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,530
关心孩子有什么不对吗？
Is that such a bad thing?

152
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
我去接她
I'm gonna go for her.

153
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,170
很称手嘛！
It fits!

154
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,470
你知道 女孩总是嫌首饰不够多
You know, a girl can never have too many accessaries.

155
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,250
你也当过霸天虎 我们可以一起把礼物献给威震天
You were a Decepticon once. We can bring the prize to Megatron together.

156
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,870
让我回到那个狼窝？我出来单干 是因为我不喜欢与人分享
Go back to that boys' club? I struck out on my own because I don't like to share.

157
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,390
这东西正好能让轮子和虎子都离我远点儿
This will provide the perfect repellent against 'Bots and 'Cons alike.

158
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,520
我的后脑勺以前从没长过眼睛
Never had eyes in the back of my head before

159
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,440
现在连后背都有枪了
or blasters to cover my rear.

160
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,520
你也有了坚强的后盾
And you get a built-in shield.

161
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,930
隔板 你不会也觉得我很像琼吧？
Bulkhead, you don't really think I sound like June, do you?

162
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,290
呃…
Er...

163
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,120
她是过度保护
She's over protective.

164
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,610
我只是…一般保护
I'm just... protective.

165
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,250
完全不同…
Totally different...

166
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,050
接近拳套了
The gauntlet's close.

167
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,860
我猜 阿尔茜随后就到
I assume Arcee isn't far behind.

168
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,520
可以这么说
You might say that.

169
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,140
把手举起来 转过身去
Blast your hands in the air and turn around.

170
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,040
遵命…
Whatever you say...

171
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,020
停火协议还有效吗 肌肉男？
Still up for a truce, muscles?

172
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,280
我只不过是更恨隔板罢了
Only because I hate Bulkhead more than I hate you.

173
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,630
噢…怎么？
Oh... What?

174
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,340
隔板 你能站着别动吗？
Bulkhead, would you stay still?

175
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,980
我的错
My bad.

176
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,940
喔
Whoa...

177
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,800
需要帮手吗？
Need a hand?

178
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,590
不 她是我的！
No, she's mine!

179
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,780
两个轮子 一起送命
Two Bots. One stump.

180
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,740
小隔 低头！
Bulk, duck!

181
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,770
隔板…起…来！
Bulkhead... Get... up!

182
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,770
骨瘦如柴
Pins like a bug.

183
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,280
当然了 我有个一劳永逸的办法让你解脱
Of course I can think of one permanent way out of your predicament.

184
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,380
当然了 我有个一劳永逸的办法让你解脱
Of course I can think of one permanent way out of your predicament.

185
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,590
我攻上盘
I'll take topside.

186
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,100
哈！
Hah!

187
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,520
我自由了
I'm free.

188
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,810
想跳个舞吗？
Wanna dance?

189
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,650
你不是我喜欢的类型
You're not my type.

190
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,570
见鬼
Scrap.

191
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,750
让男生们自己玩吧
Let's leave the boys to themselves.

192
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,130
我们两个私下里谈谈
That would be the upclose and personal setting.

193
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,600
一条腿废了 还有五条陪你玩儿
One hand tied, five more to play with.

194
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,950
质量不过关 再多也没用
Quality, not quantity.

195
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,730
同性相斥
Opposite do not attract.

196
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,040
我们碰不到金属物体
We can't touch metal.

197
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,240
我们被极化了
We are polarized.

198
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,040
我总是见好就收
Always leave on the high note.

199
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,040
隔板 拳套！
Bulkhead, the gauntlet!

200
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,950
把他们解决掉吧
Let's finish this.

201
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,900
不怕再次合体吗？
And risk becoming twins again?

202
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,430
是个纪念品 不过…
Souvenir, but...

203
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,600
不建议在室内使用
We don't advise indoor use.

204
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,890
哎哟 他们都开始一唱一和了
Eyu... They even finish each other's sentences.

205
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,660
神子 看看这个――几道新伤
Miko, check it out-- new battle scars.

206
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,100
阿尔茜 嘿…
Arcee, hey...

207
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,670
小孩子别插嘴
Let the adults talk.

208
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,030
阿尔茜 我想我应该向你道歉
Arcee, I think I owe you an apology.

209
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,890
是吗？
You do?

210
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,440
我经常担心…尤其是觉得力不从心的时候
I worry... especially when I feel like I can't control things--

211
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,610
照顾一个处在青春期的孩子 太操心了
which, with a teenager, is all the time.

212
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,780
杰克和我一直很亲近
Jack and I have always been close.

213
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,200
特别是他父亲离开之后…
Especially, after his dad left. And...

214
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,590
我想我只是…很难一下子接受生活的变化
I guess it's just... hard to accept that all that's changing.

215
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,120
我也知道 生活迟早要改变 只是…
I mean I knew it would someday, but...

216
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,160
你不是我想象的那种 让杰克鬼迷心窍的女孩
you're not quite the type of girl I thought Jack would be ditching me for.

217
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,760
我想我们都有点过于留恋从前的时光
I think we've all been a little guilty of staying attached to the way things were.

218
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,210
打击 你竟敢空手回来见我？！
Breakdown, you dare to return empty-handed?!

219
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,620
不 主人
No, Master.

220
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,970
毒蜘蛛…久违了
Airachnid... it has been some time.

221
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,130
威震天陛下…说什么好呢？很高兴能归队
Lord Megatron... what can I say? It's good to be back.
