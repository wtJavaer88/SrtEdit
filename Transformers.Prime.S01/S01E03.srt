1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,850
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,330
你们三个最好接受我们的监护
It is best that you three remain under our watch.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,920
“将得黑暗能量”！
Gaze upon Dark Dnergon.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,590
传说它威力无比 甚至能…起死回生
Legend tells that it holds the power to... revive the dead.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,340
飞过山的信号又出现了
Cliffjumper's signal pop back online.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,770
我们去找飞过山
Let's find Cliffjumper.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,100
飞过山！
Cliff!

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,700
这是什么？
What is this?

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,890
不知道 飞过山浑身上下都是这东西
Don't know. Cliff was covered in it.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,940
等等！威震天陛下！
Wait! Lord Megatron

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,950
您不知道会有什么后果！
you do not know what it will do!

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,200
抓紧了 杰克
Tighten your grip, Jack.

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,310
你这是怎么了 阿尔茜？
Heh... Hey, what's with you, Arcee?

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,300
如果没有人追杀 你可能会感觉好一点
Thought you might actually enjoy the ride if you weren't getting shot at.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,310
噢 那就来吧！
Oh, bring it!

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,700
准备好了？开始！
Ready? Set...

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,680
神子 我的职责是保护你
Miko, I'm supposed to be protecting you.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,020
隔板 我待在十吨重的钢筋铁骨里面
Bulkhead, I'm strapped tight inside ten tons of metal muscle.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,450
万无一失
I'm protected.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,630
不公平 大黄蜂
No fair, Bumblebee

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,300
你的驾龄比我长多了
you've been driving a lot longer than I have.

22
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,920
总算安静下来了
Thank goodness for peace and quiet.

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,990
我们的客人还真难缠
House guests can be such a bother.

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,390
这是？
What?

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,750
擎天柱？
Optimus?

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,880
我的火种源啊！
Oh, by the Allspark!

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,690
那个我还有用呐！
I needed that!

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,950
别想翻身！
Stay broken!

29
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,140
那东西是什么来头？
Now, what could have caused that?!

30
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,430
我有个不详的预感 救护车
I have a grave suspicion, Ratchet.

31
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,940
黑暗能量
Dark Energon.

32
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,840
威震天陛下
Uh... haha, Lord Megatron?

33
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,130
“破坏者”宇宙大帝之血
It's as if the blood of Unicron the Destroyer

34
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,710
好像流遍了我浑身的经脉
flows through my veins.

35
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,340
我好像感受到他的思想了
As if I hear his very thoughts.

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,970
我现在知道该怎么做了
I now know what I must do.

37
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,880
那我要怎样效劳呢 主人？
Ugha, haha... And what can I do to assist you, master?

38
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,650
别装可怜
Quit grovelling

39
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,470
等我发令吧！
and wait my command!

40
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,050
声波！
Soundwave!

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,960
我怀疑 我们的主人去摘星的时候
I fear that when our master reached for the stars

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,940
感染上了某种…太空疯狂症
he came down with a touch of... space madness.

43
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,870
威震天陛下自从回归后 一直没有做出正确的判断
Lord Megatron has not been having sound judgement since his return.

44
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,450
加强全球监控！
Increase global surveillance!

45
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,810
“别装可怜”
"Quit grovelling

46
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,980
“等我发令吧！”
and wait my command!"

47
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,330
我不是聋子！
I'm not deaf!

48
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,750
但如果擎天柱真的还活着
But if Optimus Prime lives

49
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,260
我相信 如果我们能把他干掉
I believe it is in Lord Megatron's best interest

50
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,830
威震天陛下会龙颜大悦的
that we insure his enemy's destruction.

51
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,950
如果阿尔茜从飞过山身上取得的残留物
If the residual Arcee found on Cliffjumper

52
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,770
能让损坏的器材复活
brought you a broken equipment to life

53
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:35,850
那就是说 同样的物质也能让飞过山起死回生
it would stand a reason that the very same substance brought Cliffjumper back from the dead.

54
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,650
他的生命信号突然出现 也能说得通了
That would account for his life signal inexplicably coming back online

55
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,520
可是…那会是黑暗能量吗？
but Dark Energon?

56
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,040
那东西非常罕见 几乎搜索不到
It's so scarce as to be virtually non-existent.

57
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,520
它怎么会在地球上出现呢？
What would it be doing on earth?

58
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,600
它是被威震天带来的
It was transported by Megatron.

59
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,470
他目的何在？
For what purpose?

60
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,910
召集一支不死大军
To conquer this planet

61
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,530
征服这个星球
by raising an army of the undead.

62
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,680
这么说 威震天需要无数个旧烤箱了
Uh heh... Well, Megatron will need to break quite a few toaster ovens

63
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,060
我是说 在这个星球上
I mean, where on this world

64
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,490
哪有那么多塞博特恩星人的尸体啊？
would he find that many Cybertronian dead?

65
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,970
帅呆了
That was awesome.

66
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,210
我们能再玩儿一次吗？
Can we go again?

67
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,270
爽啊！
S-weet!

68
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,280
对不起
Sorry

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,840
一定是我丢在后座上的
must have left that in the backseat.

70
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,770
汽车人 准备…
Autobots, prepare to...

71
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,250
出发？
Roll out?

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,410
坚守岗位
Remain here.

73
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,170
救护车 跟我来
Ratchet, you'll come with me.

74
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,250
阿尔茜 我们会暂时中断联络信号
Arcee, we'll be outside communications range for some time.

75
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,980
你来接管基地
So I'm putting you in charge.

76
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,990
哥们儿 你个头最大
Dude, you're biggest.

77
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,680
你该当老大
You should be the boss.

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,000
呃 他…从不选我
Umm, he... never picks me.

79
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,360
擎天柱 恕我直言
Optimus, with all due respect

80
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,320
做保镖是一回事 看孩子是另一回事
playing bodyguard is one thing, baby-sitting is another.

81
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,880
还有 战后救护车根本没出过基地
Besides, Ratchet hasn't been in the field since the war.

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
我的活塞可能有点生锈
My pistons might be rusty

83
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,840
但我听得很清楚
but my hearing is sharp as ever.

84
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,370
这次嘛 只是侦察
For the moment, it's only reconnaissance.

85
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,630
那你的声音怎么有点不安？
Then why do I hear an edge in your voice?

86
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,610
阿尔茜 过去的24小时里发生了很多变化
Arcee, much has changed in the last 24 hours.

87
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,480
我们都需要去适应
And we all need to adapt.

88
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,900
救护车 把我们传送走
Ratchet, bridge us out.

89
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,050
好的 老大 那…
Okay, chief, so...

90
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,520
有什么活动？
what's on the activities list?

91
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,330
我去巡逻
I'm going on patrol.

92
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,670
但大哥叫我们呆在这里
But Optimus told us to stay.

93
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,620
你当头儿时 你就说了算
When you're in charge, you can call the shots.

94
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,080
小蜂 跟我来
Bee, with me.

95
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
隔板 你来当家
Bulkhead, you're in charge.

96
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,270
那…有什么活动？
So, eh... what's on the activities list?

97
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,250
我们来…乐队排练吧！
How about... band practice?!

98
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,270
可我们不是乐手啊
But we're not a band.

99
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,290
别这么不近人情 来吧 拉夫
Why so ambisocial? Come on, Raf

100
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,860
你带了什么？
you play anything?

101
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,640
键盘行吗？
Umm... keyboard?

102
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,940
电脑套装 很好 杰克？
Laptop ensembles, good. Jack?

103
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,750
我…只是有时候玩玩口琴
I... sometimes mess around on the harmonica.

104
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,030
我像玩乡村音乐的吗？
Do I look like I do country?

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,170
往身上涂些假血
Just cover yourself in fake blood

106
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,530
然后边跳边尖叫
and jump around screaming.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,850
隔板 注意
Bulkhead, precaution.

108
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,600
重型音效来了
Look over big industrial sound.

109
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,560
自力更生 乐队组成
DIY, we're a band.

110
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,150
你们最好学学那些歌
You just got to learn the songs.

111
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,360
这首是民谣
This one is a ballad.

112
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,720
《我的拳你的脸》（史密斯飞船乐队）
"My fist your face"

113
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,770
不是吧 你受不了这种原生力量？
Come on, you can't handle the raw power?

114
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,300
近程传感器 快藏起来！
Proximity sensor. Quick, hide!

115
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,290
擎天柱！
Prime!

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,920
福勒探员 呃 大哥不在
Agent Fowler, ugh, he's not here.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,350
这儿没有人
Nobody's here.

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,750
除了我以外
Except me, of course.

119
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,160
那他去哪儿了？
Well, where did he go?

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,770
等等 别告诉我 他在糟蹋一个小商场
Wait, don't tell me. He's out pancaking a mini mall.

121
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,180
我不管你们汽车人在自己的星球上说什么语言
Now, I don't know what language your bots speak on your planet

122
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,240
但擎天柱承诺过 你们会搞定霸天虎
but Prime promised you will handle the Decepticons.

123
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,780
在内布拉斯加州炸出个大弹坑
And blowing a crater in the middle of Nebraska

124
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,730
可不是“搞定”的意思
is not what the word "handle" means in English.

125
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,760
你给我告诉擎天柱…
So you tell Prime...

126
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,050
你们什么时候开始用电驱动了？
Since when do you bots electric?

127
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,770
嘿 你好吗？
Hey, how are you doing?

128
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,270
有生人介入
Contact with civilians.

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,120
领袖卫队这次太不像话了
Team Prime has really gone off book this time.

130
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,980
等等 别告诉我你们在办托儿所吗？
Wait, don't tell me. You're running a day-care center?

131
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,350
好吧…
Okay...

132
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,560
我们是…实习生
Uh, we're... interns.

133
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,520
在校实习生
Student interns.

134
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,490
要赚外快去买汽车
Earning extra credit in the auto shop.

135
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,590
买机器人
Robotics.

136
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,830
好 我们走
Ok. Let's move.

137
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,860
我会把你们三个带到联邦拘留所
I'm taking all three of you to federal custody.

138
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,630
为了你们的自身安全
That's for your own protection.

139
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,210
他们的安全由我们保护
We're protecting them.

140
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,940
真的吗？
Is that so?

141
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,940
那你可以向我在五角大楼的上司们解释
Well, maybe you can explain that to my superiors at the Pentagon.

142
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,890
别用那个电话 它…
Don't use that phone, it's...

143
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,130
坏了
out of order.

144
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,610
这不算完 大脚 走着瞧
This isn't over, big foot. Not by a long shot.

145
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,790
擎天柱 我们来这儿要找什么？
Optimus, what do we hope to find here?

146
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,200
这是塞博特恩战争在银河系中最大的战场
The site of the largest Cybertronian battlefield in this galaxy.

147
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,890
在地球上？
On Earth?

148
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,750
你在开玩笑吧！
You must be joking!

149
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,640
你还记得战争的末期吗？
Do you recall the period late in the war

150
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,520
双方都把找到的能量藏在外星球
when both sides began hiding their energon spoils off world?

151
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,980
当然记得 所以在这样的星球上会有能量矿
Of course, it's the reason energon deposits exist on planet such as this one.

152
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,780
正是如此 这样的星球上才会有战争
It is also the reason battles came to be waged on planet such as this one.

153
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,350
我担心 威震天会知道一些很久远的事情
And I fear Megatron's memory is as long as history.

154
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,750
长官 我是福勒探员
Sir, Agent Fowler.

155
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,310
有情况
We have a situation.

156
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,830
我刚从汽车人基地出来
I'm in route from the Autobot base.

157
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,510
我会亲自向您汇报
I'll brief you in person.

158
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,310
“我是福勒探员”
"Agent Fowler."

159
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,340
“我刚从汽车人基地出来”
"I'm in route from the Autobot base."

160
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,810
“我会亲自向您汇报”
"I'll brief you in person."

161
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,480
汽车人基地啊…
Autobot base...

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,010
人类永远是弱点所在
human's always the weak link.

163
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,350
把这个福勒给我带来
Fetch me this Fowler

164
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,790
让他给我们做个汇报
so that he may brief us instead.

165
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,760
嘿 大鸟 别打扰我开飞机
Hey, big bird, I'm flying here.

166
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,760
这是什么鬼东西？
What in Uncle Sam's beard?

167
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,420
先是高速公路不安全
First, the freeways aren't safe

168
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,780
现在轮到天上了？
now air travel?

169
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,040
你想跳舞吗 虎子？
You wanna dance, Con?

170
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,830
我来领舞！
I'll lead!

171
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,200
真正需要汽车人的时候 没一个靠谱的
Never an Autobot around when you actually need one.

172
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,630
我的耳朵！
My ears!

173
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,100
是求救信号
It's an SOS

174
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,290
福勒发的
from Fowler.

175
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,100
你追踪到了吗？
Did you trace it?

176
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,030
方位扫描无法完成
Location scan wasn't complete.

177
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,200
管他呢
Oh, well.

178
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,550
“管他呢”？
"Oh, well"

179
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,780
不是吧？
seriously?

180
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,170
福勒是个混蛋
Fowler's a jerk.

181
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,580
先别说他坏话 霸天虎可能把他抓住了
Wow! Whether you like the guy or not, the Decepticons may have him.

182
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,280
福勒探员知道你们的位置…
And Agent Fowler knows your location...

183
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,800
我们的位置
mm... our location.

184
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,400
我们刚才也看见了 福勒在他们面前毫无还手之力
And did we not just witness how fast Fowler backs down from a bot?

185
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,730
虎子们肯定会给他用酷刑的
The Cons will totally make him squeal.

186
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,750
可我们失去联系了
But we lost the transmission.

187
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,200
福勒有可能在任何地方
Fowler could be anywhere.

188
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,680
我或许能把范围缩小
Maybe I can narrow it down.

189
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,380
大约五年前 政府开始在探员身上植入晶片
About five years ago, the government started micro-chipping their agents.

190
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,580
就像主人对待宠物一样
You know, like owners do with pets.

191
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,670
怎么了？我在电视上见过
What? I saw it on TV.

192
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,760
总之 如果我能入侵联邦政府的主机
Anyway, if I can hack into the Fed's main frame

193
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,950
就可能找到福勒的坐标
maybe I can pinpoint Fowler's coordinates.

194
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,510
你还是黑客呐？
You know how to hack?

195
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,840
可你才…两岁啊
But you're like... two years old.

196
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,790
十二岁…零三个月
Twelve, and a quarter.

197
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,000
欢迎你
Welcome

198
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
福勒探员
Agent Fowler.

199
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,840
你对所有客人都这么友好吗？
Uh, you treat all your guests this nice?

200
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,050
特别是对汽车人的朋友
Hmhmhmm... Any friend of the Autobots.

201
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,350
汽车人？
Autobot?

202
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,480
那些投币式的洗车机器？
That one of them coin-operated

203
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,100
那些投币式的洗车机器？
"wash my own car" places?

204
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,860
噢 原来你吃硬不吃软
Oh, so that's how it's going to be?

205
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,060
看来没人告诉过你 我不喜欢人类的幽默感
Apparently, no one has told you I have no appreciation for human humor.

206
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,210
好好招待我们的客人
Make our guest comfortable.

207
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,780
北纬39.5°西经116.9°
Latitude 39.5°, longitude 116.9°.

208
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,730
好 在这儿等着
Ok, wait here.

209
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,160
噢 乐队不能散啊！
Oh, don't break up the band!

210
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,380
呃 杰克 你来当家
Ugh, Jack, you're in charge.

211
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,690
看来我们三个可以为所欲为了
Guess we three have the run of the place.

212
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,970
神子？
Miko?

213
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,780
神子？
Miko?

214
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,920
福勒？
Fowler?

215
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,720
一整窝的霸天虎
The whole Decepticon ship-bay.

216
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,130
好了
Alright

217
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,960
有什么计划？
what's the plan?

218
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,660
神子！
Miko!

219
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,850
噢 搞砸了
Oh, unwise.

220
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,790
神子 趴下！
Miko, get down!

221
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,250
把他按住！
Hold him still!

222
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,170
神子 别看！
Miko, look away!

223
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,510
- 但…\N- 把头扭过去！
But...

224
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,290
阿尔茜 大黄蜂 你们收到了吗？
Arcee, Bumblebee, do you read?

225
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,920
很清楚 隔板
Loud and clear, Bulkhead.

226
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,050
我这儿有点情况
I have a situation.

227
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,190
隔板 他们是孩子
Bulkhead, they're children

228
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,460
是人类 随便点
humans. Just do whatever.

229
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,060
你在哪儿？
You're where?

230
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,840
她在哪儿？
She's where?!

231
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,270
我们怎么办？
What should we do?

232
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,130
隔板可能还不知道 她也去了
Bulkhead may not even realize that she followed him.

233
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,960
神子和我们不一样 她没见过虎子的行动
Miko hasn't seen the Cons in action like we have.

234
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,890
她一无所知
She has no idea.

235
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,490
坐标还锁定在他们的目的地
Those are the coordinates

236
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,510
坐标还锁定在他们的目的地
their destination still locked in.

237
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,800
呃 你来当家
Umm, you're in charge.

238
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,200
当谁的家？
In charge of who?

239
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,100
阿尔茜呼叫基地 回话
Arcee to base, come in.

240
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,930
杰克 听着 你得把我们传送回去
Jack? Listen up, we need you to bridge us back.

241
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,430
喂？
Hello?

242
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
大黄蜂 全速出发
Bumblebee, metal to the pedal.

243
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,690
福勒探员 我有一个简单的请求
Agent Fowler, I have one simple request

244
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,020
可以让你的家人免遭痛苦
that will save your family the pain of grieving.

245
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,570
告诉我汽车人基地的位置
Tell me the location of the Autobot base.

246
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,160
没问题
No problem.

247
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,210
但我先要问问你
But I need to ask you something first.

248
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,560
说吧 我听着呢
Yes, I'm listening.

249
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,870
我对这里的客户服务不太满意
I got an issue with the customer service around here.

250
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,480
我可以跟经理谈谈吗？
Could I speak to the manager?

251
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,930
我说的话就是圣旨
I make the decisions here.

252
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,370
这儿我说了算！
I am in charge!!

253
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,590
把能量棍拿来
Bring the prod.

254
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,250
阿尔茜和大黄蜂怎么还没来？
What's taking Arcee and Bumblebee?

255
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,550
哥们儿 虎子可能正给福勒上大刑呢
Dude, the Cons could be putting the clamps on Fowler right now.

256
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,270
我们干脆冲过去得了
Let's just storm the joint.

257
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,930
他们来了
Uhh, they're here.

258
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,640
他们怎么不跟自己的搭档玩儿？
Why don't those guys hang with their own bots?

259
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,700
现在是我们的二人世界
This is our one-on-one time.

260
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,180
你骨头还在颤吗？
Whoaa... are your bones vibrating?

261
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,070
你们俩！
You there!

262
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,070
- 糟了\N- 糟了
- Scrap.\N- Scrap.

263
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,850
我再客气地问你最后一次
I ask nicely one last time:

264
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,550
汽车人基地在哪儿？
the Autobot base!

265
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,940
没问题 老兄
Sure thing, buddy.

266
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,160
可你得先吃掉我的小星星短裤！
Right after you eat my star spangle shorts!

267
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,140
跟我想的一样
As I imagined

268
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,710
能量和人类神经系统相互排斥
energon and human nerval systems don't mix.

269
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,820
擎天柱 我这辈子第一次希望你是错的
For the first time in my life, Optimus, I had hoped that you were wrong.

270
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,520
擎天柱 你还好吗？
Optimus, been well?

271
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,520
你把那条忠心的看门狗也带来了
I see you brought your trusty watchdog.

272
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,200
我还以为他在废料场里养老呢
I will certainly be convalesce in the scrapyard by now.

273
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,730
你干嘛不叫他下来谈谈呢？
Why don't you invite him down here for a chat?

274
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,950
我知道你为什么来这里 威震天
I know why you're here, Megatron.

275
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,050
这难不住你 擎天柱
Hardly a surprise, Optimus.

276
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,510
毕竟 我们已经相处这么久了
After all, you and I have been at this a long time.

277
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,780
而你的大限快要到了
And your time has come to an end.

278
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,750
觉醒吧 我的战士们！
Rise, my army!

279
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,370
我的火种源啊！
By the Allspark!

280
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,860
请看 这就是传说中的…黑暗能量！
Behold, the power of Dark Energon!
