1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,760
呼呀！
Hoo-ya!

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,240
噢！
Oh!

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,500
带劲！
Munched!

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,040
为这星球上最庞大的机器巨兽欢呼吧！
Give it up for the baddest beast machines on the planet!

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,980
行行好把音量调低点行吗？
Would you mind lowering the volume?

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,940
嘿 救护车
Hey, Ratch

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,090
来看看上个星期神子带我去看的怪兽卡车拉力赛
check out the monster truck rally Miko took me to last week.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,280
我在手机上存了些精彩片段
I compiled some highlights with my cell phone.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,120
无辜的车辆为了取悦人类观众而互相厮杀？
Innocent vehicles battling for the pleasure of human spectators?

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,620
太暴力了！
Blood sport!

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,810
- 没错！
- Yea!

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,810
- 没错！
- Yea!

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
你应该去野外给擎天柱搭把手
You could be helping Optimus in the field right now.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,710
啊 他用不着我去找什么古代教育的…
Ah, he doesn't need my help to search for some ancient educational…

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,920
…鬼东西
… thingamabob.

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,580
你嘴里的这个“鬼东西”正是塞博特恩的数据经筒
The "thingamabob" to which you refer happens to be a Cybertronian data cylinder.

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,110
嘿！
Hey!

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,870
这其中浩瀚的智慧根本无法言喻
And there is no telling what vast intelligence it may hold.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,220
在黄金时代
During the Golden Age

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,460
许多这样的经筒被制造出来
dozens of these cylinders were created

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,580
每一个都储藏着塞博特恩的所有知识 涵盖一切科目
each containing the sum total of Cybertronian knowledge on any given subject:

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,200
恒星成像学 医学 古神话…
stellar cartography, medicine, ancient mythology.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,380
后来战争爆发
When the war broke out

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,690
这些经筒被隐匿到各个星系
the cylinders were hidden throughout the galaxies

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,440
以防被霸天虎染指
to keep them as far as possible from Decepticon reach.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,600
能在这里探测到一个经筒
Detecting one signal here

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,810
在地球上 就有可能…
on Earth, is the opportunity of a...

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,680
呃… 你话太多了 哥们
Eh... T.M.I., dude.

29
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,260
把频道调回去 我想看完这整场节目
Switch it back, I want to see the hoedown showdown.

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,450
救护车 有霸天虎的埋伏！
Ratchet, Decepticon ambush!

31
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,330
经筒有危险
The cylinder is at risk!

32
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,060
我们需要支援
We require backup!

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,530
我天生就是提供支援的
Backup is what I'm built for.

34
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,700
砸了他们的挡泥板 小隔
Go bend some fenders, Bulk.

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,490
我也有个重要的任务要交给你 神子
I have an important mission for you, too. Miko.

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,820
真的？
Really?

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,390
啊…
Agh...

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,520
汽车人 坚守阵地
Autobots, stand your ground.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,520
这件文物绝对不能落入敌手！
the artifact must not fall into enemy hands!

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,610
到爸爸这来
Come to papa.

41
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,980
回你妈那去
Run to mommy!

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,030
叫叔叔 快叫！
Say uncle. Say it!

43
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,620
救护车 回话！
Ratchet, come in!

44
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,990
神子？这可是紧急频道
Miko? This is an emergency channel.

45
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,120
我们得保持它畅通 以防… 等等…
We need to keep it open for the Auto... Wait...

46
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,460
你在哪里？
Where are you?

47
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,670
我就在那鬼东西旁边
D'oy! I'm with the thingamabob!

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,520
鬼东…数据经筒！
Thingama... the data cylinder!

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,790
没错 你能把这东西从这带走吗？
Yes, can you bridge it out of here?

50
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
我会重新启动你那里的坐标
I'll reactivate arrival coordinates.

51
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,130
老兄 你能把它开得再近一点吗？
Dude, can you open it any closer?

52
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,430
给我提供坐标
Supply coordinates.

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
呃… 五十码？
Ugh... Fifty yards?

54
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,490
精确的坐标！
Precise coordinates!

55
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,200
一 二 哈啊啊啊…
One, two, Hahhhhh...

56
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,830
哇噢…
Whoa...

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,340
神子？
Miko?

58
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,600
不！
No!

59
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,770
小隔！
Bulk!

60
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,670
你真是员得力干将 隔板
You really took one for the team, Bulkhead

61
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,640
不过是我们这边的
my team.

62
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,070
隔板 你没事吧？
Bulkhead, are you…

63
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,560
没事 像挠了一下痒痒
Fine. I didn't even smart.

64
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,720
我帮了倒忙把那东西弄丢了
I helped loose that thing.

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,050
我想帮忙去找
I want to help find it.

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,200
我要去现场协助擎天柱
I need to get back in the field with Optimus.

67
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,090
你现在要接受我的监护 这是擎天柱的命令
You are under my watch now -- Optimus' orders.

68
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,350
花点时间给你做个神经网络大检查才是明智之举
And running a full scan of your neural network would be a wiser use of your time.

69
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,920
拜托 医生
Come on, doc.

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,830
没什么好检查的
There's nothing up there to scan.

71
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,860
我感觉他挺好
He seems fine to me.

72
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,020
好吧 如果你一定要干点什么
Well, if you insist on making yourself useful.

73
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,190
你可以帮神子一起打扫
You can help Miko tidy up.

74
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,830
呃！
Ughhh!

75
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,460
简直是鸡毛当令箭！
He's mad with power!

76
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,520
呵呵呵 救护车就是那样的
Hehehe, that's Ratchet.

77
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,880
零向量平方 是吧？
Null vector squared, alright?

78
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
什么？
What?

79
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,400
嘿 我们有油漆吗？
Hey, we got any paint around here?

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,670
你要搞艺术？酷！
Art project? Cool!

81
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,900
你说“它是空的”是什么意思？
What do you mean "it's empty"?

82
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,950
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

83
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,760
这些经筒就像电池一样
these cylinders are not unlike batteries.

84
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,120
数据以某种能量形式存储在里面
The data is stored within them as a form of energy.

85
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,320
刚扫描到的时候它还是满的
It's scanned fully charged.

86
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,740
所以我们才能对它定位
That's how we located it to begin with.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
但是现在…
But now...

88
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
废电池一只
Dead battery.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,870
是你摔的吗 独眼白痴？
Did you drop it, you one-eye oaf?

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,250
不是的 主人
No, master.

91
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,920
我还没来得及碰 它就给隔板来了一下子
I wasn't gonna touch the thing after it put a zap on Bulkhead.

92
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,680
嘿 你想会不会…
Hey, you think...

93
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,200
我懂了
I know.

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,010
我必须弄清楚这个罐子到底装过什么东西
And I must find out what that vessel contained.

95
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,490
在那些古人的秘密中
When it comes to the secrets of the ancients

96
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,370
知识也是力量
knowledge can be power.

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,830
我是认真的 救护车
Seriously, Ratch

98
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,980
你得来看看隔板画的东西
you need to see what Bulk's painting in here.

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,330
好吧 要是不见识一下隔板的钢铁人生
Yes, I'm sure "one hasn't truly lived until one‘s beheld

100
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,380
就算是白活了
Bulkhead's take on steel life with lugnuts".

101
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,300
看 我跟你说什么来着？
See, did I tell you or what?

102
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,230
三分之一的r立方求导得到r dr r
The differential of one third r cubed is r-dr-r

103
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,810
那不是艺术
That is not art.

104
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,640
是科学
It's science.

105
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,520
你看到的这个红点
This hot spot you see here.

106
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,680
这是信息 数据 活生生的能量
It's information, data, living energy.

107
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,070
等一下 你说这是活的 还很旺盛
Hold on. It's alive, it's on fire

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,850
而且还在隔板脑子里？
and it's in Bulkhead's brain?

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,150
冷静点 神子
Chill, Miko.

110
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,860
数据仅仅是寄宿在我大脑的一部分空间内
The data is only inhabiting a fraction of my brain.

111
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,620
相比神经网络的密度规模就是无穷小
Infinitesimal by standard neural net densities.

112
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,740
等等… 我怎么懂这些东西？
Wait... how do I know all that?

113
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,110
从战斗时发生的事看来
Based on what we witness during our skirmish

114
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,380
这种活生生的数据肯定设定了程序
the living data must have been programmed to eject

115
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,960
当感知到异常接触的时候就发射出去
when it sensed unauthorized access.

116
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,970
安全措施
A security measure.

117
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,860
它本来要向空中发射
It would have jettisoned heavenward.

118
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,130
消失在星际之间
Lost to the stars.

119
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,130
没想到我的胖引擎挡住了路
Except my fat engine block got in the way.

120
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,300
每个在场的虎子都拿过它
Every Con there made a grab for it.

121
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,880
但经筒只在神子碰了之后才启动的？
But the cylinder doesn't go off until Miko touches it?

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,150
经筒起源于塞博特恩的黄金时代
The cylinders originated from Cybertron's Golden Age

123
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,850
那时还没有汽车人和霸天虎之分
pre-dating the Autobot-Decepticon division.

124
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,600
所以它不会把任何塞博特恩人当成威胁
So it wouldn't consider any native of Cybertron to be a threat.

125
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,090
只有外星生命体 比如人类
Only alien life forms, such as humans.

126
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,240
那这些是高深理论 还是胡话？
Are we staring at genius, or gibberish?

127
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,270
尽管可能是空欢喜一场
I do not wish to falsely rally anyone's hopes

128
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:48,440
但这些工式似乎是人造能量的方程式
but these equations appear to be the formula for a synthetic Energon.

129
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,940
我们挖到宝了？
We hit the mother lode?

130
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,010
神子 你明白这意味着什么吗？
Miko, do you understand what this means?

131
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,270
呃…
Um...

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,930
能量给我们提供燃料
Energon provides our fuel

133
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,510
弹药 还有我们的生命力量
our ammo, our life force.

134
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,600
地球上天然的能量如此稀缺
With the natural stuff in such short supply here on Earth

135
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,910
这可以解决许许多多的问题
this could solve a whole lot of problems.

136
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,280
比如 提供为我们逆转战争形势的优势
Such as, providing us with the edge we need to turn the tide of this war.

137
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,260
或者 获得复兴塞博特恩的关键技术
Or, handing us the key to revitalizing Cybertron.

138
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,820
我们拿到了实物
We got the goods

139
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,970
而威震天所拿到的只有一个空罐子
and all Megatron got was an empty bucket.

140
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,820
我何曾有过用脑子还能大显身手的时候？
How often do I get to use my knocking to save the day?

141
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,660
原子坐标的交点显示出收敛的三级结构
Intersection of atomic coordinates indicate convergent tertiary structures.

142
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,170
- 你还没写完吗？\N- 简单转化数据是不可逆的
- Are you done yet?\N- Simply converting data is irreversible

143
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,470
最终产生不对称…
resulting in asymmetric...

144
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,700
不得不说
Got to admit

145
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,450
聪明模式的隔板感觉有点奇怪
it's weird seeing Bulk in brainiac mode.

146
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,590
向量L模值的平方
Vector L norm squared.

147
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,600
休息时间！
Break time!

148
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,820
来场风驰电掣的街头赛车7如何？
How about a lightening round of T.M.T. street racer 7?

149
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,150
能量温度与体积比例… 三分角技巧
Energon temperatures in volume proportional... angle trisector construction.

150
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,420
又该你记录了 救护车
Got another round for you to log, Ratchet.

151
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,440
上一次我们看到隔板的神经网络是这样的
This is Bulkhead's neural net as you saw it earlier.

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,710
这是几分钟前新的扫描记录
This scan was recorded just minutes ago.

153
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
我担心的就是这个――
It is as I feared --

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,390
这些数据正在积极地 侵蚀性地
-- the data seems to be actively and aggressively

155
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,890
重写隔板的神经网络
re-writing Bulkhead's neural net.

156
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,150
我曾指望他能清除数据
I had hoped he was purging the data

157
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,010
但他似乎只顾着照抄这些数据 而这些数据
but he seems to be merely transcribing it, as it...

158
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,610
正在占据他的思维
Consumes his mind.

159
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,120
所有迹象表明
From all indications

160
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,160
当隔板完成方程式时
by the time Bulkhead completes the formula

161
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,730
他自己的思想 他的记忆
his own thought, his memories

162
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,210
都会被抹掉
could be wiped clean.

163
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,440
但是如果我们阻止了他
But if we stop him

164
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,540
那就等于挥别了人造能量
good-bye synthetic Energon.

165
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,410
前提是我们能找到阻止他的方法
You assume we possess a means of stopping him.

166
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,090
我还不能立即理解古人的智慧
I don't exactly have instant access to the wisdom of the ancients.

167
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,360
我不能容忍又一个战友牺牲
I will not allow another one of our own to be sacrificed.

168
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,430
不惜一切代价
No matter the cost.

169
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,380
如果这些有生命的数据把自己从经筒里传输出来
If the living data transmitted itself from the cylinder

170
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,720
也许我们能 用些什么办法把它再塞回去
perhaps we could somehow coaks it back inside.

171
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,340
我们又怎么从霸天虎手中夺回经筒？
How are we supposed to get it back from the Decepticons?

172
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,410
威震天会主动送过来的
Megatron will bring it to us.

173
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,590
子集放大后的摩擦系数值…
Friction coefficient quotient of the subset amplified...

174
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,560
想要放大音量吗？
You want amplified?

175
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,570
证明观测者悖论在此处不适用…
Proving perceptor's paradox is nothing of a kind.

176
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,430
啊！怎么回事？
Nah! What is that?

177
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,910
金属 你喜欢这首歌
Metal. You loved this song.

178
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,690
我需要集中精力
I'm trying to concentrate.

179
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,040
呃… 你的口气越来越像救护车了！
Ughh... You are starting to sound just like Ratchet!

180
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,150
谁？
Who?

181
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,070
救护车 我觉得隔板有些失去理智了
Ratch, I think Bulk's losing his mind.

182
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,150
你… 已经知道了…
You... already know...

183
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,710
神子 我们不想吓到你
Miko, we didn't want to frighten you

184
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
不过你放心
but rest assured

185
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,820
擎天柱已经有计划了
Optimus has a plan.

186
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,480
擎天柱不是隔板的医生
Optimus isn't Bulkhead's doctor.

187
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,340
我只想知道
I just need to know

188
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,280
等隔板念完那些方程式
when Bulk's done spitting out that formula

189
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,190
他会重新变回原来那个隔板 对吗？
he'll go back to being regular old Bulkhead, right?

190
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,260
威震天陛下 我们探测到了一个熟悉的能量信号
Lord Megatron, we've detected a familiar energy profile.

191
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,470
数据的？
The data?

192
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,150
隔板离开了他们基地的保护屏障
Bulkhead must have left the shielded radius of their base.

193
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,390
打击和我要去…
Breakdown and I will...

194
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,140
再搞砸一次？
Fail me again?

195
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,960
擎天柱
Optimus.

196
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,100
显然你不是我想见到的汽车人
You're certainly not the Autobot I expected to find here.

197
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,550
不过 让我猜猜――
But let me guess --

198
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,210
你装备了发射器 伪造了我想找的数据信号
you rigged the transponder to mimic the frequency of the data I seek.

199
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,080
威震天 我有个提议
Megatron, I have a proposal.

200
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,520
但说无妨
I'm… listening.

201
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,330
交出经筒
Surrender the cylinder

202
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,410
我会把它重新充满 并还给你
and I will return it to you fully restored.

203
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,830
这个小玩意儿？
This trinket right here?

204
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,170
请你告诉我
And pray tell

205
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,300
它到底装了什么不祥之物 你如此急于脱手？
what trifles did it hold that you are so anxious to give away?

206
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,260
接受我的提议 你自然就知道了
Accept my terms, and you will find out.

207
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,470
你还记得千斤顶将他唯一的手雷\N扔进霸天虎热交换机的场景吗？
Do you remember the time you watched Wheeljack lobbed his only grenade into Decepticon heat-exchanger?

208
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,490
谁？
Who?

209
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,980
千斤顶！你最好的伙伴…
Wheeljack! Your best bud--

210
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,440
当然 除了我以外的
beside me, of course.

211
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,410
你还知道我是谁吗？
Do you even know who I am?

212
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,580
当然 你是…
Of course, you're...

213
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,190
等同于扁球体的F拓扑中心的n次方
Equivalent to the Fréchet mean of the oblate spheroid to the N power.

214
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,200
孤立的E的内能仍为常量
Internal energy of the isolated E remains constant.

215
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,660
继续干 隔板
Keep them coming, Bulkhead.

216
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,050
过来
Come on.

217
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,800
你想完成你的方程式 是不是？
You want to finish your formula, don't you?

218
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,900
你接受我的提案吗？
Do you accept my proposal?

219
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,140
威震天陛下…
Lord Megatron...

220
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,290
给我点时间
Give me a moment.

221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,920
您找到想找的东西了吗？
Did you find what you were looking for?

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,360
情况复杂
It's complicated.

223
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,730
嗯 击倒和我好像找到了隔板
Well, Breakdown and I may have located the bogie

224
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,590
充满数据的
fully charged.

225
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,810
说下去
Proceed.

226
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,410
只有一个小问题…我们没有经筒
Just one hitch -- we don't have the cylinder.

227
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,200
那就把隔板的脑袋给我带回来
Then bring me the head of Bulkhead.

228
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,270
看 你喜欢怪兽卡车
Look, you love monster trucks.

229
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,420
记得我们上周在节目结束之后偷偷溜进这里吗？
Remember when we snuck in here after the show last week?

230
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,850
质量与散逸率平方乘积恒定
Mass times diffusion rate squared is constant.

231
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,930
所有这些就没有一样能让你想起点什么吗？
Is any of this ringing a bell?

232
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,370
钟形曲线？不不不
Bell curve? No, no, no

233
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,760
那不吻合
that wouldn't factor in.

234
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,280
我们星期天早上的沙丘冲刺呢？
How about our Sunday morning dune-bashings?

235
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,940
去看歪猴子的表演呢？
Rocking out to Slash Monkey?

236
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,380
帮我做作业呢？
Helping me with my homework?

237
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,850
陷阱问题！
Trick question!

238
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,600
你知道我不做作业…
You know I don't do homework...

239
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,790
对吗？
Don't you?

240
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,820
好吧 不管过去怎样
OK, forget the past.

241
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,400
从现在开始我们能制造新的回忆
Starting now, we can make new memories.

242
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,710
热能的三次根UΔE违反苦朗克能量守恒定律
The cube root of the exothermic energon U delta E violates Clank's Law of energon conservation.

243
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,000
隔板 我知道你内心的某个地方会一直记得我
Bulkhead, I know somewhere inside you always remember me

244
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,770
我只是想让你知道
and I just want you to know

245
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,950
我永远不会忘记你
I'll never forget you.

246
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,520
真感人！
Boo hoo!

247
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,170
我眼睛都要流润滑油了
I'm shedding lubricant.

248
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,740
现在立刻跟我走
Follow me right now

249
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,680
否则这些家伙会…
or these guys are gonna...

250
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,610
偷走方程式！
steal the formula!

251
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,880
我的方程式？
My equations?

252
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,880
快来 快来！
Come on, come on!

253
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,300
临阵脱逃并不像是隔板的作风
Not like Bulkhead to run from a fight.

254
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,900
恐怕我们的朋友是思考过度了
I'm afraid our friend has had a little too much to think.

255
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,790
威震天陛下 我们很顺利
Lord Megatron, we are good.

256
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,780
擎天柱 经过我仔细的考虑
Optimus, upon careful consideration

257
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,910
如果你想要经筒
if you want the cylinder

258
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,720
你必须自己来抢
you'll have to take it.

259
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,630
好吧 捉迷藏游戏
OK, then, fun and games.

260
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,720
出来吧 出来吧 不管你在哪里
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

261
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,190
呃…虎子们干扰了信号
Ugh... the Cons are scrambling the signal.

262
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,810
多边形的三分线是不可分子集
The trisector the polygon is an integral subset.

263
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,990
嘘… 安静！
Shhh... quiet!

264
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,400
不管你做什么 别动
And whatever you do, keep still.

265
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,480
我试着离远一点再请求支援
I'm gonna see if I can get far enough to call for backup.

266
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,430
隔板 是你吗？
Bulkhead, is that you?

267
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,090
打击 别管那个人类了
Breakdown, forget the human.

268
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,160
游戏的有趣之处
Games are only fun to play…

269
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,480
就是快赢的时候
… when you are winning.

270
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,590
我想我赢了
I think I'm warm.

271
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,270
EM3除以斥力系数的平方根等于…
EM3 devided by the square root of a propulsion factor equals...

272
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,400
你弄脏了我的喷漆！
You painted my paint job!

273
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,790
准备挨刀吧！
Prepare for surgery!

274
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,120
你的脑袋归我了
Heads, you lose.

275
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,350
不！
No!

276
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,660
好吧 既然如此 就谁也别想要
Well, in that case, no one gets it.

277
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,870
擎天柱 隔板和神子离开了基地
Optimus, Bulkhead and Miko have abandoned base.

278
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,080
我有他们的环陆桥坐标
I have their GroundBridge coordinates.

279
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,120
把我们传送回来 快
Bridge us back, immediately.

280
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,950
又来了？趴下！
Not again! Get down!

281
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,380
我又惊动它了？
I did it again?

282
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,310
隔板？
Bulkhead?

283
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,660
废电池一只
Dead battery.

284
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,640
如果我们丢了数据 威震天会刮了我的喷漆
Megatron will peel our paint for losing that data.

285
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,680
所以我们必须得扒了你的皮
So we are gonna have to peel you.

286
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,060
还是溜之大吉吧
Or, peel out of here.

287
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,730
隔板…
Bulkhead...

288
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,170
数据已经被完全清除了
The data has been fully expelled

289
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,610
但隔板却仍然完全没有反应
but Bulkhead remains completely unresponsive.

290
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,780
因为那能量将隔板的意识一起带走了
Because the energy took Bulkhead's mind with it.

291
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,730
飞向天际 消失在群星之间
Heavenward. Lost to the stars.

292
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,780
因为我的错 你们永远都不会知道方程式剩余的部分了
It's my fault you'll never know the rest of the formula

293
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,230
也是因为我 隔板永远地消失了
and it's my fault Bulkhead's gone forever.

294
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,810
神子 你的机智应对
Miko, your quick thinking prevented the formula

295
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,710
阻止了方程式落入霸天虎手中
from falling into Decepticon hands.

296
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,650
如果有谁会赞成这种行为的话 那一定是隔板
If anyone would've backed that plan, it's Bulkhead.

297
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,840
现在就对他的状况下结论还为时过早
It's simply too early to know the extend of his condition.

298
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,510
很简单的一些事 比如熟悉的景色
Something as simple as a familiar sight

299
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,700
气味 甚至只是声音
or smell, perhaps even a sound

300
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,960
都有可能唤醒隔板
could trigger Bulkhead's awakening.

301
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
隔板？
Bulkhead?
