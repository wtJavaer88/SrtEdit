1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,000
并提醒司机和行人注意安全…
citing the danger to both drivers and pedestrians...

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
不是本地风格 欧式喷漆吗？
Not from around here. European design?

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,700
的确很漂亮 但是过头了
Sure it's pretty. Too pretty.

4
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,000
你犯了个大错
Big mistake.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
噢…伙计
Oh... dude.

6
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,800
你刮我的漆
You scratch my paint

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,300
我要你的命
I scratch yours.

8
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
嘿 这不是女式轻骑么
Hey, cherry moped.

9
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,500
呃 这款轻骑配有双化油器 百公里加速只要3.5秒
Uh, this moped has dual carbs and can go 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds.

10
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,700
呃 杰克
Uh, Jack

11
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,900
女士的属性可是个人隐私
a lady's vital stats are her own business.

12
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,600
嘿！你叫尼克对吧？
Hey! Nick, right?

13
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,000
其实…是杰克
Actually... it's Jack.

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,900
杰克 不好意思 我叫塞拉
Jack. Sorry. I am Sierra.

15
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,300
我…我知道
I... I know.

16
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,900
你说过要带我去兜风的是吗？
You once offered to take me for a ride?

17
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,400
我…当然说过 随时恭候
Of... course I did, at any time.

18
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,300
我是你的保镖 小鬼
I'm your guardian, kiddo.

19
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,700
不是电灯泡
Not your wingman.

20
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,500
那么 现在如何？
So, how about now?

21
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,500
呃…
Uh...

22
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,900
嘿 世界真小啊
Hey, small world.

23
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,700
呃…我们在聊天
Em... been having a conversation.

24
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,900
这位啦啦队长可能很乐意欣赏 你和四轮肌肉车过招
Cheer captain here might enjoy watching you take on four wheels of muscle car.

25
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,700
你是想跟我…赛车吗？
Are you challenging me... to a race?

26
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,800
理解力不错嘛 笨鸟 敢不敢应战？
You catch on quick, paunch. What do you say?

27
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
呃…
Uh...

28
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
你…你没让我回答
You... you didn't let me answer.

29
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,100
对
Nope.

30
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,700
阿尔茜 我们可以赢得他灰头土脸
Arcee, we can smoke him.

31
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,200
没错
Yeape.

32
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,000
呃…你真不近人情
Uh... you just don't get it.

33
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
规矩不是我定的 杰克
I don't make the rules, Jack.

34
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,800
是擎天柱
Optumis does.

35
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,100
守则第一条还记得不
And rule No.1, in case you missed it

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,000
绝不能在个人享乐上滥用能力
never abuse power for a personal game.

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,800
也包括马力
And that includes horse power.

38
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
文斯 赛车可能不太适合我
Vince, maybe racing isn't such a good idea.

39
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,200
明白
hahaha, figured.

40
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
你把摩托车当成宝贝一样骑
You ride around like your bike's something special.

41
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,900
可它只是辆笨蛋老破车 丑到极点了！
But it's just a chunky clunky trike, and ugly.

42
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,800
够了 这小丑死定了
That's it. The yahoo is going down.

43
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,600
喔 守则第一条不管了？
Wow, what happened to rule No.1?

44
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,900
守则也是人定的 下不为例
Gets bent. Just this once.

45
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,700
我说姑娘们 你们那个姓达比的 他…
Yo, girls, your pal Darby, he's...

46
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,700
随时应战 小蚊子
Ready when you are, Vinny.

47
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,200
司机农场旁边的土道 一小时后
Dirt road by Trucker's Ranch. One hour.

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,000
从这儿到下一个里程牌 预备…出发！
From here to the next mile marker. Ready? Go.

49
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,400
还真公平啊
Oh, that was fair.

50
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
呃…阿尔茜？
Eh... Arcee?

51
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,700
只是A就便宜他了 杰克
Winning isn't enough, Jack.

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
要让他欲哭无泪
You wanna make him cry.

53
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,900
什么？
What?

54
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,600
一马当先！
Outstanding!

55
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,200
喔 嘿 现在可不可以顺势带塞拉在街上兜一圈？
Oh, hey, now it might be a good time to offer Sierra quick once around the block?

56
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,600
别得寸进尺
Don't push it.

57
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600
啊 打击
Ah, Breakdown

58
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,900
威震天的身体状况有点起色没有？
has there been any change in Megatron's condition?

59
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,100
呃 只是脸色好了点
Um, only cosmetic.

60
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,500
好吧 我相信你和那个神医已经尽力了
Well, I am sure that you and the good doctor have been doing everything in your power.

61
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
击倒哪儿去了？
Where is Knock Out?

62
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
你能猜到某个臭皮匠对我做了什么吗？
Can you believe what some skinjob did to me?

63
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,500
你又去和人类飙车了 对不对？
You have been street racing among the humans again, haven't you?

64
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,800
我不只是辆车 还是辆狂热的赛车
I'm not only an automobile, I am an automobile enthusiast.

65
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,900
我力求军纪严明 击倒
I do strive to run a tight ship, Knock Out.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,300
我强烈建议你 下次你决定开小差的时候 要征得本人的许可
I would strongly suggest that you seek my permission next time you decide to disappear on one of your little jobs.

67
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,900
没问题 指挥官先生
No worries, Herr Commandant.

68
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,300
你应该叫陛下
It is lord to you.

69
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,600
等威震天驾崩之后再说吧
Only if Megatron takes a nosedive.

70
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,000
有朝一日我们的主人苏醒
The day our master emerges from stasis

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
我将把头衔拱手相让
I will graciously relinquish the title.

72
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,700
但我认为几乎没这个可能
But I believe that outcome is unlikely.

73
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,800
目前的医疗水平不过如此
Something to do with the quality of medical care around here.

74
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,800
继续抛光吧
So continue buffing.

75
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,500
我们真心希望威震天在追悼会上红光满面
We do want Megatron looking his best for the memorial.

76
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,300
先给我抛个光
Buff this.

77
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
别告诉任何人
Not a word to anyone.

78
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,000
我们的小秘密
Our little secret.

79
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,600
伙计！嗡 嗡 嗡…获胜者是…
Dude! vong... and the winner is?

80
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,300
神子 谁告诉你的？
Miko, who told you?

81
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
你开玩笑吧？全校都知道了！
You kidding? It's all over school!

82
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,700
你让那个叫文斯的学校霸王输得找不着北了
You beat the pants off that blowhard bully Vince.

83
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,500
你们得严格保密 尤其不能告诉擎天柱
You guys have to keep this on the DL, especially from Optimus.

84
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,600
嘿 我正找你呢
Hey, I've been looking for you.

85
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,400
那比赛可真过瘾 我一直在喊…
The race, how great was that, I was like...

86
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,600
耶！加油 杰克！
Yeah, go Jack!

87
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,100
也…没什么
It... it was no big deal.

88
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,600
算你说对了
You got that right.

89
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,100
如果你觉得能跑过那些高手的话？
If you think you can run with the big boys

90
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,500
今晚11点 赛道见
the circuit, tonight, 11pm.

91
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,600
你答应了？
You agreed to what?

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,700
那是个地下赛车俱乐部
It was some kind of secret racing club.

93
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,800
我也不清楚 我没得选
But I don't know, I had no choice.

94
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
塞拉当时就在我旁边
Sierra was standing right there.

95
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
你总会有选择权的 杰克
You always have a choice, Jack.

96
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
你听不懂什么叫“下不为例”吗？
And what part of "just this once" did you not understand?

97
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,000
我知道…对不起
I know... I'm sorry.

98
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,800
可…我们会去的 对吗？
But... we are on, right?

99
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,700
我们不去
We are not on.

100
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,500
击倒 红蜘蛛又找不着你了
Knok Out, Starsceam's been looking for you again

101
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,700
你在哪儿？
where did you go?

102
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,800
自然是出来兜风了
Out for a little drive.

103
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
在几个城市之间转转
I just rode from town to town

104
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
侦察侦察…
sniffing around until...

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,700
机会总是能找上门来的
the next opportunity presents itself.

106
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,400
拉夫
Raf

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,700
呃…可以把大黄蜂借我一个小时吗？
uh... is there anyway I could borrow Bumblebee for one hour?

108
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,200
杰克 赛车违反规定 你是知道的
Jack, you know racing is against the rules.

109
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,100
擎天柱知道了怎么办？
What if Optimus found out?

110
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,500
但是拉夫 他得去泡妞
But Raf, he's gotta get the girl

111
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,700
顺便打黑除恶…
and beat the bully...

112
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
那…
Well...

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
求你了 拉夫 下不为例…
Come on, Raf, just this once...

114
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,500
摩托车送修了
Bike is in the shop.

115
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
各位车手 准备好了吗？
Circuit drivers, are you ready?

116
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,000
开足马力 但要遵守规则
Make it beep but keep it clean!

117
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,000
准备 5 4 3 2 1！
Fire on 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

118
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,700
那个汽车人叫…大黄蜂
The Autobot they called... Bumblebee.

119
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
那是什么 小蜂？
What was that, Bee?

120
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,100
慢着 我认识那车
Wait, I know that car.

121
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,200
什么…
What the...

122
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,200
你能甩掉他吗 小蜂？
Can you lose it, Bee?

123
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
你说什么？
What do you say?

124
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
但愿那是“同意”的意思
I hope that means yes.

125
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,200
我可不想呼叫基地请求增援
Cause I'd rather not have to call base for backup.

126
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,400
有谁看到杰克了吗?
Anyone's seen Jack?

127
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,900
上次之后…
Not since...

128
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,100
就再没见过
we last saw him.

129
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,100
他们在赛车 对吧？
They are racing, aren't they?

130
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,800
下不为例
Just this once.

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
你知情吗？
Did you know about this?

132
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,500
不…大概 知道一点
No... maybe. A little.

133
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,300
你们被击倒盯上了？
You are being chased by Knock Out?

134
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,600
听上去像是个霸天虎
That sounds like a Decepticon.

135
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
小蜂 不要交战
Bee, do not engage.

136
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,100
你的首要任务是保证杰克的安全
Your first priority is to keep Jack safe.

137
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
到时候我再教训他
Until I get my hands on him.

138
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,200
小心 地滑
Slick.

139
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
我们大概甩掉他了 小蜂
I think we lost him, Bee.

140
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,900
喔 别开这种玩笑啊！
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

141
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,700
达比！
Darby!

142
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,600
文斯 你得离开这儿 算你赢了 行吗？
Vince, you have to get out of here, you win, okay?

143
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,500
恭喜你！快走！
Congratulations! Now, go!

144
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,200
不 不 言出必行 笨蛋
No, no, start or backoff, loser

145
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,900
必须跑完比赛！
we are finishing this race!

146
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
不想在终点线出丑是吗？行！
Don't wanna take to the finish line? Fine!

147
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,600
那我们就地解决！
Then we got something to settle right here! Right now!

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
怎么回事？你要干…
What's going on? What are you...

149
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,300
打击 你绝对想不到我抓到了什么
Breakdown, you'll never guess what I'm packing -

150
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,700
是大黄蜂的人类伙伴
Bumblebee's human friend.

151
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,500
等那个汽车人来营救的时候…
And, when the Autobot attempts to stage a rescue...

152
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,000
就给他来个致命“打击”
He has a... Breakdown.

153
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,600
小蜂 他跑了！
Bee, he's getting away!

154
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,600
我…我听不懂你的话！
I... I can't understand you!

155
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,100
听着 我可不是拉夫
Look, I am not Raf

156
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
你能不能…鸣笛一声代表坏消息
can't you just... honk once for bad news

157
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,900
两声代表好消息？
and honk twice for good news?

158
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
杰克 我们得好好谈谈
Jack, we need to have a little chat.

159
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,300
等等吧 阿尔茜
Later, Arcee.

160
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,600
文斯被那个狡猾的跑车虎子抓走了
Vince's got snatched by the slick sportscar Con.

161
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,700
击倒怎么会抓个无名氏呢？
What would Knock Out want with a random human?

162
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,500
也许他把文斯当成大黄蜂的人类伙伴了
He probably mistook Vince for Bumblebee's human friend.

163
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,300
可连我都不算是大黄蜂的人类伙伴
I'm not even Bumblebee's human friend.

164
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,200
我不知道 管他为什么抓人 文斯有麻烦了！
I don't know, it doesn't matter why he took him... Vince is in trouble!

165
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,600
好吧 算文斯倒霉
Oh well, tough break for Vince.

166
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,600
隔板！
Bulkhead!

167
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
怎么了 这家伙不是个混蛋吗？
Why, I heard this guy is a jerk.

168
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,500
我不否认 但他是无辜的
No arguement there, but the guy is also innocent.

169
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,800
文斯不该被虎子蹂躏
Vince doesn't deserve to get crushed by Cons.

170
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
上车
Hop on.

171
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
他们早该回来了
They should have called off by now.

172
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,900
你觉得大黄蜂会有事吗？
You think Bumblebee is okay?

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
别担心 拉夫
Don't worry, Raf

174
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,100
隔板不会让杰克和小蜂出事的
Bulkhead won't let anything happen to Jack or Bee.

175
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,100
我们应该跟擎天柱说实话
We should just tell Optimus the truth.

176
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,300
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

177
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
我们说好的
We made a deal.

178
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,600
假装没事就行
Just act completely normal.

179
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
拉夫 神子
Raf, Miko

180
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,900
你们知道其他人去哪儿了吗？
do either of you know where the others have gone?

181
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,900
什么？不 长官 我们不知道
Why, no, sir. We do not know.

182
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,700
神子说得对 我们不知道
Miko is correct. We do not know.

183
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
我们怎么会知道？
Why would we know?

184
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
呃…
Hum...

185
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,300
大黄蜂叫帮手来了
Bumblebee brought company.

186
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,300
提高警惕 各位 可能是个陷阱
On your guard, boys, could be a trap.

187
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,700
记住 别开火
Remember, no shooting.

188
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
安全起见
Speaking of safety

189
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,900
你该在这儿下车
here is where you get off.

190
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
那个两轮儿的去哪儿了？
Hmm... Where's the two-wheeler?

191
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,200
嘿！当心我的喷漆！
Hey! Watch the paint!

192
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
好姑娘！
That's my girl.

193
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
呃 打击
Uh... Breakdown

194
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,700
友情提醒你一下 场面有点乱
in case you are looking for me, thing's got messy.

195
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,100
我开溜了
So I hit the road.

196
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,500
一天剐蹭一次已经受够了
One scrape is enough for today.

197
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,200
吃灰去吧
Eat my dust.

198
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,300
擎天柱 击倒有人质
Optimus, Knock Out has a hostage.

199
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,100
明白
Understood.

200
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,400
你知道换零件多麻烦吗？
Do you know how hard that is to replace?

201
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
擎天柱…是我的错
Optimus... This was my fault.

202
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
必须立刻把这男孩带到安全地区
We must get this boy to safety immediately.

203
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,400
认错另选时间 你们都有责任
Explanations can come later, from all of you.

204
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,800
怎么了…出什么事了？
How did... What happened?

205
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,200
有人在桥下抓住你
Someguys... jumped you under the bridge

206
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,300
想拉你入伙
they tossed you into their trunk

207
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,300
像是某种入会仪式
must be some kind of initiation.

208
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
真的吗？
Really?

209
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,700
没错 我发现你…
Yeah, I found you...

210
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
晕倒在路边
knocked out by the side of the road.

211
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
我…得承认 有了今晚的经历
I... I gotta be honest, after what I saw tonight

212
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,800
我觉得赛车真的不适合我
I'm thinking racing just isn't my thing.

213
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
这还用说 达比
I hear you, Darby

214
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,200
骑脚踏车是赢不了比赛的
hard to win a race driving a pedal car.

215
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,900
击倒！我说的还不清楚吗？
Knock Out! Was I not clear?

216
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,900
你竟敢再次无视我的命令！
You have defied my order yet again.

217
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,100
我知错了 红蜘蛛指挥官
My mistake, commander Starscream.

218
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
我也吸取了教训
But I've learned my lesson.

219
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
还付出了代价
And paid the price.

220
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,100
叫我陛下！
It is Lord!

221
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,300
而且你付出多少代价 由我说了算
And you have paid when I say you have paid.

222
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,100
别担心 对你的惩罚只是…面子问题
Do not worry, Your punishment shall be mearly... cosmetic.

223
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,500
不 别刮喷漆 除了喷漆什么都行 不！！
No... not the finish, anything but the finish, No!!

224
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,100
那个…杰克 你有时间去兜风吗？
So, Jack, do you have time for that ride?

225
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,000
呃 我…很抱歉 塞拉 现在不行
Uh... I... I'm sorry, Sierra, I can't right now.

226
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,500
没关系 那我们就…回头见吧
No problem, I guess I'll just see you around.

227
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
上车
Hop on.

228
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,600
喔…真的吗？
Oh... Really?

229
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,800
下不为例
Just this once.
