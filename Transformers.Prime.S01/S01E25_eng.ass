Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.98,0:08:44.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,However, I have a proposal.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.37,0:09:15.63,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,why come to us?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.74,0:09:21.63,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Because this particular endeavor requires something beyond the realm of my command--
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.92,0:09:24.46,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,-- the power of a Prime.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.63,0:09:27.61,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Huh, then I guess we don't need you.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.74,0:09:29.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,On the contrary,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.30,0:09:32.66,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Optimus maybe the only one who can defeat Unicron,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.81,0:09:36.42,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but I remain the only one who can guide you to him.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.62,0:09:46.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Optimus, our past alliances--
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.51,0:09:49.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,-- Autobot, Decepticon, no longer matter,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.87,0:09:52.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,not while Unicron lives.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.54,0:09:55.39,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The past always matters!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.55,0:09:59.03,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,A truce between Autobot and Decepticon.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.20,0:10:02.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,How long do you expect us to believe that will last?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.72,0:10:06.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Only as long is this mutually beneficial.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.82,0:10:11.01,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And when our proposed to shared mission is complete?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.15,0:10:13.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I will conquer this Earth,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.47,0:10:15.39,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,my way.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.45,0:10:18.76,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Brutal honesty from a Decepticon?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.89,0:10:23.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Aligning with the lesser of two evils is still siding with evil.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.61,0:10:27.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you think you've witnessed the full power of Unicron?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.69,0:10:30.76,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Those foot soldiers were nothing more than a taste.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.89,0:10:33.76,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Unicron has yet to fully awaken.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.98,0:10:37.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,With each passing moment, the bringer of chaos evolves,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.95,0:10:41.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,mutating Earth from the inside out.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.62,0:10:44.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What we have witnessed until now is but a prelude
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.62,0:10:49.43,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,of the utter devastation his rising will wreak upon your world.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.58,0:10:52.22,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Like your quest for power destroyed Cybertron?

Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.17,0:11:07.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Absolutely not!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.00,0:11:12.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Ground bridging into space or onto moving train is difficult enough,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.63,0:11:17.45,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but plotting a blind jump inside of a sentient being?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.57,0:11:22.20,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Besides, direct expose to that much Dark Energon will debilitate you.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.32,0:11:25.24,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You haven't built up immunity like Megatron has.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.36,0:11:29.04,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yet another strong argument for solidarity,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.22,0:11:31.12,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,my guidance.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.32,0:11:34.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You can provide Unicron's exact coordinates?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.32,0:11:38.26,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If you transport us to this planet's core,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.42,0:11:42.10,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I can lead you directly to Unicron's spark,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.40,0:11:46.42,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the very heart of his darkness.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.94,0:11:54.37,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Optimus, even if we survive the jump,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.48,0:11:56.43,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,how are we supposed to stop Unicron?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.18,0:12:04.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,With the Matrix of Leadership.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.62,0:12:06.74,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What is that?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:06.91,0:12:09.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,A vessel of pure energy,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.45,0:12:12.61,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the collective wisdom of the Primes.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.75,0:12:15.21,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Do we have time for a scavenger hunt?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:15.36,0:12:18.25,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I mean where is Optimus supposed to find this Matrix?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.37,0:12:20.76,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Optimus does not need to find it.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.93,0:12:23.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,He carries it within him.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:24.03,0:12:30.82,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It was the combined power of the Primes that defeated Unicron so long ago,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.98,0:12:34.26,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the very reason he now seeks to destroy you.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:34.38,0:12:39.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It would follow that unleashing the power of the Matrix directly into Unicron's spark
Dialogue: 0,0:12:39.62,0:12:42.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,would return him to stasis.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:42.90,0:12:43.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Hold on.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.96,0:12:45.40,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If everything goes right,
