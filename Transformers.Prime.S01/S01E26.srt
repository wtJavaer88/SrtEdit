00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,030
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime:

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,250
万一你牺牲了 擎天柱 恐怕这星球也活不成了
If you don't survive, Optimus, I fear neither will this planet.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,380
不！
No!

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,180
是谁干的？
What happened?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,880
- 不是我\N- 也不是我
- Wasn't me.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,630
是我干的
I happened.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,160
擎天柱 我们过去的阵营
Optimus, our past alliances--

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,650
什么汽车人 霸天虎 都去他的吧
-- Autobot, Decepticon, no longer matter

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,900
眼下 宇宙大帝复活了
not while Unicron lives.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,210
我能直接带你们找到宇宙大帝的火种
I can lead you directly to Unicron's spark.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,510
汽车人与霸天虎之间的停战协议
A truce between Autobots and Decepticon.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,130
擎天柱 我们该怎么阻止宇宙大帝？
Optimus, how are we supposed to stop Unicron?

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,290
用领导模块
With the Martrix of Leadership.

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,210
看来统帅弃我们而去了
It appears our leader has abandoned us.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,960
我认为 我们必须做出长远的打算 无需考虑威震天了
I believe we must consider the possibility of the future without Megatron.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:48,320
杰克 我觉得 你完全可以担当保管这个重要器物的责任
Jack, I feel you've earned the responsibility of safeguarding this important device

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,920
直到我回来为止
until I return.

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,080
那个…宇宙大帝何时才会发现我们？
So how long before Unicron Knows we're here?

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,310
别搞错了 他已经知道了
Make no mistake. He already does.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,360
宇宙大帝的力量又增强了
Unicron grows ever stronger.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,220
怎么才能确定 威震天不是带我们走进宇宙大帝的陷阱？
How do we know Unicron isn't using Megatron to lead us all into a trap?

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,780
无法确定
We do not.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,360
全世界有超过16座火山接连爆发
More than 16 volcanoes are erupting worldwide and downtown Honolulu is under 6 inches of snow.

24
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,340
科学家一度推断 这些史无前例的自然灾害与星球串联之间…
Scientists continued to devise theories connecting these unprecedented natural disasters with the planetary alignment which...

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,630
好了 谁想做游戏？
So, who wants to play a game?

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,030
我受够了！
That tears it!

27
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,720
你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,030
我不能就这么眼睁睁看着全世界失控
I can't just sit on my hands while the world spins out of control.

29
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,020
那你究竟想干什么？
And what exactly is that that you intend to do?

30
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,110
什么都想干！
Anything.

31
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,310
叫上五角大楼的弟兄们 想办法彻底埋了那个怪物
Hook up with my boys at the Pentagon, figure out a way to bury that monster for good.

32
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,620
你是担心擎天柱会失败？
In the event Optimus can't?

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,180
你看好擎天柱和威震天联手吗？
Don't you mean Optimus and Megatron?

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,930
没有人看好这种搭配 福勒探员 包括我在内
No one here is thrilled about this arrangement, Agent Fowler, myself included.

35
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,500
可既然他们二人能再次并肩战斗…
But with Optimus and Megatron together again...

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,610
喔 慢着 再次？
Wow, wait, again?

37
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,310
威震天当过汽车人？
Megatron was an Autobot?

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,140
擎天柱以前是虎子？
Optimus was a 'Con?

39
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,260
不 都不是 话说 那是在很久以前的塞博特恩
No, on neither count. But there was a time back on Cybertron

40
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,040
黄金时代尚存余辉 擎天柱和威震天还不是宿敌
in the twilight hours of the Golden Age, when Optimus and Megatron were not sworn enemies.

41
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,240
还记得吗？我说过 擎天柱并不一直是领袖
Do you recall when I mentioned that Optimus wasn't always a Prime?

42
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,740
其实 他的本名也不叫擎天柱
While, he wasn't always Optimus either.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,740
当时他只是铁堡档案馆的小职员 名叫奥利安・派克斯
He was once a clerk in the Iacon Hall of Records, named Orion Pax.

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,210
随着对塞博特恩历史的深入了解
But as he learned more about Cybertron's past

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,440
他越发关注高层人士存在的腐败问题
he grew increasingly concerned about the present corruption in high places

46
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,040
以及民众中的不平等现象
and inequality among the masses.

47
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,160
一个角斗士的思想言论使奥利安深受启发
Orion became inspired by the words and ideas of a gladiator

48
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,540
那个战士给自己冠以十三元祖领袖之一的名字 震天威
one who had named himself after one of the 13 original Primes, Megatronus.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,290
震天威立誓要挑战塞博特恩的领导阶级 要求所有塞博特恩人享受平等待遇
Megatronus vow to challenge Cybertron's leadership and demand that all Cybertronians be treated as equals.

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:32,520
这个角斗士振臂一呼 很快召集了一批忠实的追随者
This gladiator turned revolutionary rapidly gathered a loyal following, Soundwave chief among them.

51
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,090
奥利安开始和震天威来往 而后者逐渐扮演了导师的角色
Orion began corresponding with Megatronus who came to be something of a mentor to him.

52
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,410
震天威离开了角斗场 走上政治舞台 出于私心 他改换了自己的名字
As Megatronus left the gladiatorial arena for the political, he shift to shorten his name.

53
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,480
不久之后 威震天在最高议会面前 提出了他所谓的公正社会构想
Before long, Megatron appear before the High Council to propose his vision for a just society.

54
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,360
从此之后 他开始露出自己真实的面目
And it was here that he began to reveal his true colors

55
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:06,570
他声称 要用武力推翻陈旧的制度
proclaiming the need to overthrow the old goverments with force and arrogantly demanding to be named as the next Prime.

56
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,450
但是 奥利安认为 不能用暴力手段来换取正义
But Orion did not believe in violence as a means of achieving justice.

57
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,490
议会成员们被奥利安的真知灼见所折服
The Sparks and minds of the Council were moved by Orion's words.

58
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:23,270
此时此刻 自塞博特恩进入黄金时代以来
Here, for the first time since Cybertron's Golden Age, stood someone worthy of being a Prime.

59
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:30,090
但是 要想获得那种荣耀 只有先赢取传说中的领导模块
But that honor could only truly be achieved by earning the legendary Matrix of Leadership.

60
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,930
野心落空之后 威震天愤然与奥利安和议会一刀两断
His ambition thwarted, Megatron spitefully severed all ties with Orion and the Council

61
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:45,140
并向所有对立者开战
and came to wage war on all who opposed him though his growing army of followers which he named Decepticons.

62
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,130
他发誓 无论模块藏在何处 都要将它据为己有
He vow to claim the Matrix for himself wherever it might lie.

63
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:59,440
后来 塞博特恩饱受战争的蹂躏 星球的核心也备受荼毒
In time, warfare consumed Cybertron, poisoning the planet to its core.

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:11,390
奥利安进入核心 希望能使星球起死回生
Orion journeyed there hoping to reverse the ill effects and found himself before the very spark of our life giver, Primus himself.

65
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:20,210
原始天尊在弥留之际 领会到奥利安与生俱来的高尚品质
The ailing Primus sensed the innate nobility within Orion and bestowed the Matrix upon him.

66
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:32,280
就这样 诚惶诚恐的奥利安・派克斯 正式更名为擎天柱 成为最后的领袖
It was thus, that a surprised and humbled Orion Pax came to be Optimus, the last of the Primes.

67
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,540
这么说 擎天柱从塞博特恩的核心拿到模块 现在要把它送给地球？
So Optimus get the Matrix from Cybertron's core and now he's going to give it to Earth's?

68
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,400
如果威震天这次还想把模块据为己有 我们怎么办？
What's to stop Megatron from just claiming the Matrix for himself this time around?

69
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,390
他拼命想保住这个星球\N就是为了日后在这里称霸 这一点他供认不讳
Only his greater desire to save this planet so that he may in turn conquer it, as he so compellingly argued.

70
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,550
何况 霸天虎头领提出的停战协议 从来都不可全信
Provided the lord of the Decepticons can never be fully trusted.

71
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,770
宇宙大帝的火种就在附近
Unicron's spark is near.

72
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,410
你先走
After you.

73
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,380
没事 小蜂 只是有点头晕
Fine, Bee. Just woozy.

74
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,790
黑暗能量已经开始影响他了 走路小心点儿 小隔
The Dark Energon. It's starting to affect him. Steady as you go, Bulk.

75
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,580
他准备给我们下逐客令了
He is preparing to expel us.

76
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,790
那是些什么东西？
What are those things?

77
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,640
我们身处宇宙大帝体内 由此可见 它们应该是某种抗体
As we are within Unicron's body, it stands to reason they are some sort of antibody.

78
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,640
小蜂 放开我 不然我会连累你的！
Bee, let me go. I'll only take you down with me.

79
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,250
快放手 小子！
Just let go, kid.

80
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,530
隔板！
Bulkhead!

81
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,190
拉住你了
I got you.

82
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,390
阿尔茜！
Arcee.

83
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:40,240
各位霸天虎同僚 尽管我们对威震天一直是忠心耿耿
Fellow Deceticons, while our loyalty to Megatron's command has always remains steadfast

84
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,670
但统帅近期的种种行为实在难以服众
our leader's recent behavior has been questionable at best.

85
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,160
而且如各位所见 地球不过是个失败的试验品罢了
And it would seem as though Earth has become nothing short of a failed experiment.

86
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,940
毒蜘蛛指挥官 你不是想说 我们该抛弃威震天陛下吧？
Commander Airachnid, you're not suggesting that we abandon Lord Megatron?

87
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,610
尽管声波一再努力 我们仍无法搜索到主人的信号
Despite Soundwave's efforts, we have been unable to detect our master's signal.

88
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,530
威震天不是一命呜呼 就是被宇宙大帝吞并
Megatron is either permanently off-line or in the thrall of Unicron

89
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,740
无论如何 这对于霸天虎都非常不利
neither is in the best interest of the Decepticons.

90
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,460
所以我认为 及时撤军才是万全之策
So I am deeming an exodus to be the most prudent cause of action

91
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,310
除非有人提出异议
unless anyone has a problem with that.

92
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,790
向瑞特兰四号星球出发
Set course for Regulon Four.

93
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,840
你有话要说吗 声波？
You have something to say, Soundwave?

94
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,390
这艘船由我指挥 请你坚守岗位
I command this vessel. You will resume your post.

95
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,790
给我让开！
Step aside!

96
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,660
噢…
Oh...

97
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,990
我要扯出你的火种下酒！
I'll tear out your spark for that!

98
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,690
我服了
I yield.

99
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
当心这种闷骚型的
Watch out for the quiet ones.

100
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,540
通讯链失灵 这在预料之中
Communication links are down, as expected.

101
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,650
可连他们的信号也跟丢了
But we've lost their signal.

102
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,600
那岂不是…
Doesn't that mean...

103
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,930
这不足为怪 但更合理的解释是 电磁异常现象对信号造成了严重的干扰
Usually. But a more likely explanation would be the severe interference caused by these eletromagnetic anormalies.

104
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,600
要是我们找不到他们 他们也没法找我们…
So if we can't track them and they can't contact us...

105
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,830
我们怎么知道 该什么时候接头？
How are we gonna know when they're ready for pick up?

106
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,710
那个是谁给你的？
Where did you get that?

107
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,780
擎天柱 老实说 我也不知道他干嘛要把环陆桥电源的钥匙给我
Optimus. Honestly, I don't know why he gave me the key to the ground bridge power supply.

108
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,350
杰克 环陆桥没有钥匙
Jack, there is no key to the ground bridge.

109
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,270
那好吧 这是什么？
Well then, what is this?

110
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,560
那是魔力神球之匙
That is the key to Vector Sigma.

111
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,140
什么？
The what?

112
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,390
你手中的是塞博特恩最重要的文物之一
You're holding one of Cybertron's most important relics.

113
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,460
我何德何能…
I shouldn't have this.

114
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,440
这是擎天柱托付给你的 杰克
Optimus entrusted it to you, Jack.

115
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,540
可我怎么都想不通 为什么？
But that doesn't make any sense, why?

116
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,440
因为他没打算活着回来
Because he doesn't plan on coming back.

117
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,620
威震天 听我号令
Megatron, do what I command.

118
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,960
消灭那个领袖！
Destroy the Prime!

119
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,810
威震天！
Megatron!

120
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,770
宇宙大帝的火种就在那后面
Unicron's spark lies just beyond.

121
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,820
我们怎么进去？
How do we get inside?

122
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,420
骗过宇宙大帝的防御机制 让它认为我们不构成威胁
By fooling Unicron's defenses into believing we're not a threat.

123
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,300
汽车人 我需要你们尽量拖住攻击者 越久越好！
Autobots, I will need you to keep our attackers at bay for as long as you can.

124
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,440
我们得撑住 为擎天柱拼了！
We got to hold fast, for Optimus.

125
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,730
擎天柱 快上！
Optimus, swiftly.

126
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,120
威震天
Megatron.

127
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,720
消灭那个领袖 这是命令
Destroy the Prime. I command you.

128
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,170
我威震天决不听命于任何人！
Megatron is commanded by no one!

129
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,510
- 地震！\N- 快找掩护！
- Earthquake!\N- Take cover!

130
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,970
领导模块 拜托你了！
Matrix of leadership, I call upon you.

131
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,400
你无法打败我 原始天尊的门徒 我已是超越现实的存在！
You cannot defeat me, disciple of Primus. I have transcended physical being.

132
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,010
仅凭我的旨意 整个世界就可陷入无底深渊！
By my will alone, all upon this world shall fall into chaos.

133
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,340
只要我活着 你就休想 宇宙大帝！
Not while I still function, Unicron.

134
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,030
领导模块之力将照亮我们最黑暗的时刻！
The power of the Matrix will light our darkest hour!

135
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,780
不！！
No!!

136
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,200
可能还有余震
There could be aftershocks.

137
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,600
你觉得他们…
Do you think...

138
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,860
肯定在
I do.

139
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,040
耶！呼呀！
Yeah! Hoo-ya!

140
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,120
太棒了！
Yes!

141
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,640
这也叫团队合作？
Teamwork, huh?

142
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,010
（Megatronus 震天威 元祖十三金刚中的堕落金刚的本名)
Where are we, Megatronus?

143
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,810
你忘了吗 老朋友？
Don't you remember, old friend?

144
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,820
擎天柱 你还好吗？
Optimus, are you OK?

145
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,560
他干嘛那么叫我？
Why did he call me that?

146
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,400
你把他怎么了？
What did you do to him?

147
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,890
他们是谁？
Who are they?

148
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,170
是我们的死敌！
Our mortal enemies.

149
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,470
我们寡不敌众 快走 我掩护你！
We are outnumbered. Go, I'll cover you.

150
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,990
阿尔茜
Arcee.

151
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,830
我担心死了 小隔
I was worried, Bulk.

152
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,950
你没事吧 小蜂？
You alright, Bee?

153
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,660
擎天柱呢？他是不是…
And Optimus? Is he...

154
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,900
死了？没有
Dead? No.

155
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,060
但他把我们几个当成陌生人 连他自己的名字都忘了
But he looked right at us without recognizing us, didn't even know his own name.

156
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,610
擎天柱释放领导模块之后 失去的不止是领袖们智慧的结晶
When Optimus surrendered the Matrix of Leadership, he lost more than the collective wisdom of the Primes.

157
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,590
还有他自己的记忆
He lost his own memories.

158
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,860
欢迎回宫 威震天陛下
Welcome back, Lord Megatron.

159
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,970
放松 打击 不该这样对待一个失散多年的同志
At ease, Breakdown. That is no way to welcome a long-lost comrade.

160
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,160
奥利安・派克斯是我们的人！
Orion Pax is one of us.
