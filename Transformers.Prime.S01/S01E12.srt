1
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,340
啊…早知道就带驱虫剂来了
Arhhh, really wish I packed some insect propellent.

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,420
这次常规巡逻碰上的蚊子 个头都赶上吸血蝙蝠了
The mosquitoes out here on this routine recon are the size of vampire bats

3
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,520
而且吸血也不算少
and they drink just about as much of blood.

4
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,680
真是个野外生存专家啊 杰克
Quite the outdoorsman, aren't you, Jack?

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,500
你不会是在嘲笑我的求生包吧？
You wouldn't be making fun of my survival kit?

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,690
也许吧
Maybe.

7
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,420
我也许没有一身防叮咬的铁皮 阿尔茜
I may not have stinger-proof metal skin, Arcee

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,310
但在紧要关头 我可以用我的多功能军刀
but in a pinch, I can use my multi-function pocket knife

9
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,910
和镁棒打火石
and magnesium fire-starter

10
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,540
做一些速食奶酪通心粉
to cook up some freeze-dried mac and cheese.

11
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,910
你有你的办法 我有我的高招
You have your tools. I have mine.

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,120
有蹊跷
That's odd.

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,020
救护车的卫星扫描很准确
Ratchet's satellite scans were accurate

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,370
但地下能量矿不可能引起这种强烈感应
but subterranean energon deposits don't cause this kind of surge.

15
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:39,920
这是怎么回事？
What happened here?

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,270
飞船迫降
Crash landing.

17
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,970
待在我身后 小心跟紧
Stay behind me, low and close.

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,070
是汽车人 还是霸天虎？
Autobot or Decepticon?

19
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,270
说不准 在这里等着
Can't tell. Wait here.

20
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,660
阿…阿尔茜？
Ar... Arcee?

21
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,110
阿尔茜 出什么事了？
Arcee, what's wrong?

22
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,980
我知道这是谁的飞船了
I know who this ship belongs to.

23
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,640
阿尔茜呼叫基地 请尽快打开环陆桥
Arcee to base, I need a Ground Bridge ASAP.

24
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,090
等…等等 怎么了？
Wa... wait, why?

25
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,440
这是谁的飞船？
Whose ship is this?

26
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,250
基地 听到了吗？
Base, do you read?

27
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,140
见鬼！通讯链失灵了
Scrap! Comlink is dead.

28
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,870
这艘船肯定在发射高频干扰脉冲
The ship's got to be transmitting a high frequency scrambling pulse.

29
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,580
阿…阿尔茜？好吧 你吓着我了
Ar... Arcee? OK, you're kind of freaking me out here.

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,470
在这里等着
Wait here.

31
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,460
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

32
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,790
上车！
Climb on!

33
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,320
喔 阿尔茜？
Whoa, Arcee?

34
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,360
噢 好吧 至于这么紧张吗？
Ho, OK, was that really necessary?

35
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,750
阿尔茜呼叫基地…见鬼！
Arcee to base... scrap!

36
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,670
听着 危险我见得多了 这有什么大…
Look, I've seen danger before, what's the big...?

37
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,910
在这儿等着 我可不是开玩笑
Wait here, I mean it this time.

38
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,260
好吧 让我靠边就算了 现在又想甩了我？
OK, first you shut me out, now you're ditching me?

39
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,330
我以为我是你的搭档呢
I thought I was your partner.

40
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,120
不 杰克 你是个孩子！
No, Jack, you are a kid!

41
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
你能跟我来 是因为这里原本没有危险
You are only here because this was supposed to be no risk.

42
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,400
明白了吗？
Got it?

43
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,770
阿尔茜呼叫D小队 请提供会合坐标 听到没有？
Arcee to Delta Team, requesting rendezvous coordinates, do you copy?

44
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,830
阿尔茜 你又迷路了？
Arcee, you lost again?

45
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,320
你的方向传感器可以大修了
Your sensor-direction could use some improvement.

46
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,480
你的瞄准镜也该修了 挡板
So did your aim, Tailgate.

47
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,130
如果你在炮兵仓库干掉了那个狙击手
If you tagged that sniper back at the artillery depot

48
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,380
我就不必脱离大部队 跟敌人近身肉搏了
I wouldn't have to break rank and engage the enemy hand to hand.

49
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,510
听周围的声音 你大概是打赢了吧？
From the sound of things, I'm guessing you came out ahead?

50
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,860
这次你要是乖乖等着我 我就一五一十讲给你听
Try waiting up for me this time and I'll give you the blow-by-blow.

51
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,190
你的方位是？
What's your position?

52
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,780
仓库正北方 大约半分钟路程处（1klik＝72秒）
About half a klik from depot due north.

53
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,750
你能找到吧 搭档？
Think you can find it, partner?

54
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,080
相信我 挡板 我的探路能力…
Trust me, Tailgate. My navigation ability... Uh... Ah...

55
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,250
一个小建议…
Piece of advice...

56
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,400
把这里当成自己家吧
make yourself comfortable.

57
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,120
你得在这儿长住了
You are going to be here a while.

58
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,670
造访以来首次出手…
My first local...

59
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,680
该让人类尝尝我的毒刺了
Time for human kind to feel my sting.

60
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,780
阿尔茜 宇宙真小啊
Ar-cee, small universe.

61
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,920
小得出奇 毒蜘蛛
Too small, Airachnid.

62
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,620
你还在耿耿于怀？
You are still holding a grudge?

63
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,920
大战已经结束好几兆周期了
The war's been over for mega-cycles.

64
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,260
这话去跟霸天虎说吧
Tell that to the Decepticons.

65
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,940
最近我一直孤身旅行 追求我的新兴趣
These days I travel solo, in pursuit of my new hobby.

66
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,090
我看过你那箱纪念品了
I got a look at your souvenir case.

67
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,320
我把那叫做战利品
You mean my trophies.

68
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,980
我收藏濒危物种
I collect endangered species.

69
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,890
当然 他们并非真的濒危 只是因为遇到了我
Of course, they aren't really in danger, until they meet me.

70
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,920
我给人类也留了一个位置
And I have a slot reserved for human.

71
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,370
不必了！
Not gonna happen.

72
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,030
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

73
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,120
我说过让你等我！
I told you to wait for me!

74
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,310
那个 身为搭档 要同甘共苦
Well, partners don't ditch partners.

75
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,250
给我记住了：
Get this through your head:

76
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,390
你不是我的搭档 只是个累赘
You are not my partner, you are a liability.

77
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,460
我不信
I don't believe you.

78
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,730
从你的眼神能看出来 你害怕了 阿尔茜
I can see it in your eyes. You are afraid, Arcee

79
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,340
以前你从没怕过
and you're never afraid.

80
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,840
知道吗 作为汽车人来说 你的适应力非常强
You know, for an Autobot, your resilience is quite impressive.

81
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,470
事实上 我估计不管对你如何用刑
In fact, I'm guessing that no matter what I do to you

82
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,880
你都不会屈服
you'll never crack.

83
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,680
我说得对吗？
Am I right?

84
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,540
如我所料
That's what I thought.

85
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,770
挡板？
Tailgate?

86
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
你们对他做了什么？
What have you done to him?

87
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,170
没什么
Not much

88
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,070
暂时的
yet.

89
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,580
把我想知道的东西告诉我
Just tell me what I want to know

90
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,430
否则 哦 你是个聪明人
or, well, you're a smart bot.

91
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,630
你应该能想得出 挡板会遭什么罪吧？
I think you can imagine what happens to Tailgate next.

92
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,450
我不知道攻击地点
I don't know the attack coordinates.

93
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,960
我对火种源发誓 我说的是真的！
I swear upon the Allspark, it's the truth!

94
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,770
我们走着瞧
We shall see.

95
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,530
不 求求你！
No, please!

96
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,240
挡板！
Tailgate!

97
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,970
你说得对 杰克 我怕了
You are right, Jack, I am afraid

98
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,480
怕失去你！
of losing you.

99
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,240
你显然不善于和搭档相处 不是吗？
You sure have trouble hanging on to your partners, don't you?

100
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,120
挡板的下场 我们都知道
We both know what happened to Tailgate

101
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,580
不过 最近我偶然听到霸天虎们聊天
but I recently picked up some Decepticon radio chatter regarding the passing of Cliffjumper.

102
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,580
他们说飞过山死得很惨
but I recently picked up some Decepticon radio chatter regarding the passing of Cliffjumper.

103
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,790
有时候 你真该问问你自己 阿尔茜
At some point, you really have to ask yourself, Arcee.

104
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,010
问题到底在他们 还是在你自己？
Is it them, or is it me?

105
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,380
现在你明白了 杰克？
Do you get it now, Jack?

106
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,350
她不是冲我来的 她要猎杀本土物种
She is not interested in me. She hunts indigenous species

107
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,550
在地球上 那就意味着人类 你！
and she's on earth. That means humans. You!

108
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,910
快逃！
Run!

109
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,420
哈哈哈…这就是我喜欢单干的原因
Hahahaha... And that's why I now prefer to work alone.

110
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,800
看着你最亲近的人遭到不幸 真是太难过了
It's so sad when bad things happen to those close to you.

111
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,640
不过别误会
But don't get me wrong.

112
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,990
我十分期待着掐灭你的火种
I fully intend to snuff out your spark.

113
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,940
相信我 那会非常痛苦
And believe me, I will make it hurt.

114
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,060
不过 还有一件让你痛不欲生的事情
But that won't compare to the pain you feel knowing

115
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,210
我要把你的人类搭档加入我的收藏
I'm adding your human to my collection.

116
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,840
杰克！！
Jaaaaack!

117
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,590
精神可嘉 杰克 想玩矜持是吗
That's the spirit, Jack. Play hard to get.

118
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,440
我救不了他 我救不了我的搭档！
I couldn't save him. I couldn't save my partner!

119
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,850
杰克 对不起
Jack, I'm sorry.

120
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,920
我不该畏首畏尾…
I never should have looked back...

121
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,520
我应该…勇往直前
I should have... kept driving.

122
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,390
你好啊 杰克
Hello, Jack.

123
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,410
别自欺欺人了
Who am I kidding?

124
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,140
你把难度降得太低了 杰克
You're making this too easy, Jack

125
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,520
我不喜欢如此乏味
and I do not enjoy being bored.

126
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,940
好了 你逃到哪儿去了？
Now, where did you scamper off to?

127
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,950
如果想四处转转 杰克 跟我说就行了
If you wanted a tour, Jack, all you had to do was ask.

128
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,710
你看到那个空位了吗？
Did you spot the empty space?

129
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,250
但愿你喜欢
I hope you like it.

130
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,150
那儿很快就要挂上你的头了
It's where you'll soon hang your head.

131
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,980
能量
Energon.

132
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
杰克？
Jack?

133
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,610
杰克！
Jack!

134
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,440
杰克
Jack.

135
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,380
你没事吧？
Are you OK?

136
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,750
当然没事 我有求生包！
Yea, of course. Survival kit!

137
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,230
毒蜘蛛！
Airachnid!

138
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,370
唔…到此为止
Uh... so much for closure.

139
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,630
现在 毒蜘蛛留在地球上了
Now Airachnid's stuck here on Earth.

140
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,260
这大概不是什么好事
I'm not sure that's such a good thing.

141
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,880
我…很抱歉 今天让你面对那个疯子
I'm sorry you had to face that dement today.

142
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,620
你表现得很勇敢 杰克
You were pretty fearless there, Jack.

143
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,330
唉 其实我很害怕
Hgh... actually I was terrified.

144
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,250
主要是怕失去你
Mostly for you.

145
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,510
救护车 请求接通环陆桥
Ratchet, requesting Ground Bridge.

146
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,210
得让我的搭档离那些大虫子远点儿
Need to get my partner far away from any over-sized insects.

147
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,970
搭档 嗯哼？
Partner, Ughr?

148
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,070
小搭档 你还是得听我的
Junior partner. I can still pull rank.
