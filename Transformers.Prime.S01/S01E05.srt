1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,340
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,270
干得漂亮 擎天柱！
Bravo, Optimus!

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,820
你最好为正戏保存一点实力！
You may wish to save your strength for the main event!

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,240
我们得找到福勒 再把孩子们带出去
We need to find Fowler and get these kids outta here.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,780
我们被卷进来 都是因为你
It's your fault that we're stuck in this intensity.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,200
你是怎么想的 神子？
What were you thinking, Miko?

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,820
我一看就知道那是数学问题
I know math when I see it.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,220
那可是个信息量巨大的方程式
And that is one serious equation.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,900
如果和汽车人在一起 每天都有生命危险
If this was just an average day with the Autobots

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,290
那我不干了
then I don't wanna be a part of it.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,930
可你干的蠢事弄垮了我的飞船！
Your mindless agenda resulted in the disabling of my ship!

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,550
还耽误了我的大事！
And the delay of my plans!

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,250
威震天正在建造太空桥
Megatron's building a Space Bridge

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,850
用它召集一支征服大军
to bring through his conquering army.

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,240
可是 唯一能让威震天召唤无数死人的地方是…
But the only place Megatron could recruit that many fallen warriors...

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,880
塞博特恩
Cybertron.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,610
绝不能让威震天用他的太空桥传送黑暗能量
We cannot allow Megatron to send Dark Energon through his Space Bridge.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,510
如果我们失败了
If we fail

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,470
塞博特恩的死者们将会复活
the dead of Cybertron will rise

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,910
冲破他的时空漩涡
swarm through his vortex

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,890
并侵略地球
and invade Earth

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,710
人类将在威震天的邪恶统治下痛不欲生
bending human kind to Megatron's twisted rule.

23
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,760
单车不错嘛
Nice bike.

24
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,240
阿尔茜 说真的 神子已经和我谈过了
Arcee, really, Miko already tried.

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,080
告诉擎天柱 我非常敬重他 但…
Tell Optimus I respect him big time. But...

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,450
如果你们跟霸天虎交战的话
if you're at war with the Decepticons

27
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,380
我也帮不上什么忙
there's nothing I can do to help.

28
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,610
不是擎天柱派我来的 也没人请你帮忙
Optimus didn't send me, and no one's asking for your help.

29
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,820
好吧 既然你我都知道 我不是打仗的料…
Ok, so if we both agree that I'm not warrior material...

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,390
杰克 我刚失去了一个知心朋友
Jack, I just lost someone I cared about.

31
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,660
可能是出于悲痛…
Maybe it's the grief talking...

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,190
也可能是和你投缘
maybe you're growing on me.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,830
无论怎样 我还不想说再见
Whatever it is, I'm just not ready to say good-bye.

34
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,950
擎天柱 我找到威震天那个太空桥的方位了
Optimus, I've pinpointed the location of Megatron's Space Bridge.

35
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,510
在地球轨道的最高点上
High in Earth's orbit.

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,470
超出了我们的行动范围
Out of our reach.

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,490
好吧 就算你们不能飞
Ok, so you guys don't fly.

38
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,500
那么用环陆桥不就行了吗？
But can't you just Ground Bridge there?

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,860
环陆桥的传输范围是有限的
A Ground Bridge has limited range.

40
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,230
冲进环轨道运行的时空漩涡
Stretch all the way into the orbited vortex could snap

41
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,160
可能会把我们弹射到宇宙的任何地方
and scatter us to the stars.

42
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,170
威震天应该已经在招兵买马了
Since Megatron is likely already in transit

43
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,990
恐怕我们要硬闯虎穴
I'm afraid we must take that risk.

44
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,590
要想制止他 我们只有到太空桥上殊死一搏了
Reaching the Space Bridge first, is our only means of stopping him.

45
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,980
嘿 猜猜谁回来了
Hey, guess who's back.

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,240
汽车人 准备出发
Autobots, prepare for departure.

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,190
去哪儿？
Where to?

48
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,270
“最后的边疆”（《星际迷航》台词）
The final frontier.

49
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,240
太空？我还以为他们没法上天呢
Space? I... I thought they didn't have any way to get there.

50
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,620
他们不能
They don't

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,500
的确不能
really.

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,100
那就回头见了？
Umm, be seeing you?

53
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,990
小心点儿 大黄蜂
Be careful, Bee.

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,250
我真是眼红
I'm so jealous.

55
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,140
甭想找借口跟着我
Don't even think about following me.

56
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,900
擎天柱 如果你把我永远丢在这个只有人类的星球上
Optimus, if you leave me stranded on a planet teeming with humans

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,150
我决不会原谅你
I will never forgive you.

58
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,930
后会有期 老朋友
Until we meet again, old friend.

59
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,960
汽车人 出发！
Autobots, roll out!

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,190
全速前进！
Maximum overdrive!

61
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,330
汽车人 变形！
Autobots, transform

62
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,210
着陆！
and gravitise!

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,020
别往下看 别往上看 别往左看
Don't look down, or up, or left.

64
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,140
这么说 威震天准备了足够的黑暗能量 足以让塞博特恩的死者全都复活？
So Megatron's packing enough Dark Energon to raise Cybertron's dead?

65
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,250
既然我们没有十足的把握关闭太空桥
And since we don't possess ready means of disabling the Space Bridge

66
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,180
那就谁也休想从这儿进出！
nothing gets in or out.

67
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:09,230
擎天柱从来不会让人失望
Hahaha... Optimus Prime never disappoints.

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,590
不像你 红蜘蛛！
Unlike you, Starscream!

69
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,130
不必担心 主人
No need for concern, master.

70
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,410
声波正在锁定塞博特恩的坐标
Soundwave is locking on to Cybertron's coordinates

71
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,460
是我让他去做的
per my instructions.

72
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,700
那个…他们还在等什么？
Well, what are they waiting for?

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,380
看来霸天虎飞船的星际导航系统出现了严重的损坏
It appears that the Decepticons have sustained serious damage to their inter-stellar navigation system.

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,200
噢 那是我干的
Oh, that's my handy work.

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,800
做得好 隔板
Great job, Bulkhead.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,210
没有天线
Without the dish

77
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,060
威震天就无法让太空桥和塞博特恩对接
Megatron will be unable to aim the Space Bridge at Cybertron.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,590
霸天虎连自己的星球都找不到吗？
Don't the Decepticons know where their own planet is?

79
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,010
当然能
Naturally

80
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,530
但塞博特恩位于数万光年以外
but Cybertron is many light years away.

81
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,820
要想连接目的地 他们的定位必须无比精准
To reach their target, their aim must be astronomically precise.

82
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,930
如果威震天在和太空桥接轨时出了问题
If Megatron went to the trouble of rendezvousing with his Space Bridge

83
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,090
他必然会借助于另一个定位系统
He must have an alternate targeting system.

84
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,960
一个远距离系统
A remote one.

85
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,060
哼 根据我对地球科技的了解
From what I know of Earth technology

86
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,700
这个星球上没有一个射电望远镜天线
I doubt there would exist a single radio telescope dish on this planet

87
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,310
功率大到可以锁定塞博特恩
powerful enough to pinpoint Cybertron.

88
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,650
如果用射电望远镜天线阵列呢
What about a whole bunch of linked radio telescope dishes?

89
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,180
比如说德克萨斯州的那个阵列？
Like the giant size array in Texas?

90
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,850
老实呆着…这可不是在过家家
Sit back... this is not a child's play.

91
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,850
好主意 拉夫
Good thinking, Raf.

92
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,150
救护车 让福勒探员通知阵列的工作人员 提高警惕
Ratchet, have Agent Fowler alert the array's stuff to the security hazard.

93
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,940
你 大兵！
You, soldier

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,890
你没穿制服 把裤子穿上！
you're out of uniform. Put on some pants.

95
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,160
这恐怕难度不小
That maybe a challenge.

96
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,030
我没法入侵阵列的防火墙
I can't get passed the array's firewalls.

97
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,190
安全系数太高了
They're too thick.

98
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,300
你…以为自己能挡得住那些霸天虎吗？
You... actually think you could keep the Decepticons out?

99
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,320
只要能…入侵系统的话…
Maybe... if I could get in.

100
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,070
等等 拉夫
Wait, wait, wait. Raf.

101
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,740
我们把你送到…最里边怎么样？\N也就是说“建筑内部”？
What if we could get you... all the way in? Like "inside the building" in?

102
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,210
我可以在防火墙的另一端登录他们的内部网络
I can login to their internal network on the other side of the firewall.

103
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,170
这样太冒险了
The risk is too great.

104
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,690
霸天虎也会去那儿的 很可能现在就到了
The Decepticons will be there. Perhaps even on site.

105
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,370
擎天柱 恕我直言
Optimus, with all due respect

106
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,830
你自己说过
you said that yourself

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,470
这远比三个地球人的安危更重要
this is bigger than the safety of three humans.

108
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,830
是啊 如果让虎子们赢了
Yeah, if we let the Cons win

109
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,970
我们会和地球上所有的人一起遭殃
we're fragged along with everyone else on our planet.

110
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,000
拉夫？
Raf?

111
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,650
我想试试看
I want to give it a shot.

112
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,490
我敢肯定 威震天陛下
Surely, Lord Megatron

113
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,210
汽车人想搞破坏
the Autobots are up to something.

114
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,350
真的吗 红蜘蛛？
Really, Starscream?

115
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,280
干掉他们！
Crush them!

116
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,650
大队人马前来迎驾了
Here comes the welcoming committee.

117
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,140
- 还得适应一阵子\N- 喔…
- That'll take some getting used to.\N - Wow...

118
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,870
这里的安全系统太差劲了
Security sure is lack in this place.

119
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
我进入系统了…
I'm in...

120
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,410
可这好像是霸天虎的系统
and so are the Decepticons.

121
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,250
什么？
What?

122
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,210
你怎么知道？
How can you tell?

123
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,170
看这些图表 外星方程式和他们船上的一样
Schematics, with the same alien math we saw on their ship.

124
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,480
但这次 我能下载了
But this time, I can download it.

125
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,810
一定是太空桥
It's got to be the Space Bridge.

126
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,250
霸天虎在把它和天线同步
The Decepticons are synching it to the dishes.

127
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,870
但我也能如法炮制
But I can synch to them.

128
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,130
他们会发现吗？
Will they know?

129
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,990
就算霸天虎发现我入侵了系统
Even if the Decepticons see that I'm in the system

130
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,400
也想不到我就在这间屋子里
they'll have no idea I'm in the house.

131
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,860
这是怎么回事？
What just happened?

132
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,800
霸天虎正在锁定塞博特恩
The Decepticons are locking on to Cybertron.

133
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,730
威震天陛下 太空桥随时可以启动
Lord Megatron, the Space Bridge is ready for activation.

134
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,600
总算好了！
Finally!

135
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,750
他们要锁定塞博特恩 别高兴得太早
They're locked on to Cybertron, but not for long.

136
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,710
没错 大黄蜂
Indeed, Bumblebee

137
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,220
这一定是拉夫干的
this can only be Raf's doing.

138
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,520
红蜘蛛！什么情况？
Starscream, what is happening?

139
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,370
声波！什么情况？
Soundwave, what is happening?

140
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,150
天线又转向塞博特恩了
The dishes are heading back towards Cybertron.

141
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,910
我让它们再转回来
I'll just undo that again.

142
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,620
万一虎子们知道被耍了 怎么办？
What happens when the Cons realize to being punked?

143
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,440
这只是虚拟战斗
It's only virtual combat.

144
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,360
就像在线游戏一样
You know, like online gaming.

145
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,250
是啊 杰克 虎子们还能怎么办？
Yeah, Jack, what are the Cons gonna do?

146
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,110
他们很可能远在千里之外呢
They're probably like a thousand miles away.

147
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,100
我不会再让他们锁定了
I won't let them lock on again.

148
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,050
你送给他一把斧头？！
You handed in an axe?!

149
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,570
惨了！
Not good.

150
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,580
他怎么走了？
Why's he leaving?

151
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,820
他把主线切断了
He cut the hard line.

152
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,290
天线已经被锁定在塞博特恩了…
The dishes are locked on to Cybertron...

153
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,720
永久地
for good.

154
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,240
开始吧 红蜘蛛
Now, Starscream.

155
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,510
开始
Now.

156
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,140
最后一搏！
At last!

157
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,120
觉醒吧 我的军团！
Arise, my legion!

158
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,470
那个…我们如何击败整个星球的活死人？
So, how do we beat a whole planet of the undead?

159
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,600
擎天柱
Optimus

160
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,220
他们的太空桥漩涡里出现一股能量 而且在迅速增强
I'm registering a rapidly expanding mass in their Space Bridge vortex

161
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,940
能量特征非常诡异
one with a peculiar energy signature.

162
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,700
黑暗能量
Dark Energon.

163
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,240
救护车 我们必须摧毁太空桥
Ratchet, we must destroy the Space Bridge.

164
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,120
现在通过漩涡的生命能量足够多 可以实施爆破
There's enough live energon coursing through it, to achieve detonation.

165
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,940
但我们的火力还不足以引爆它
But we lack the fire power to ignite it.

166
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,470
如果我知道太空桥的工程原理
If I knew how the Space Bridge was engineered

167
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,550
也许能从技术上找到突破口
I might find a technical way of accomplishing at feet.

168
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,780
呃 用图表可以吗？
Umm, will schematics help?

169
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,700
擎天柱 我必须提醒你
Optimus, I must say

170
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,860
太空桥是我们返回塞博特恩的唯一希望
the Space Bridge is our sole hope of ever returning to Cybertron.

171
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,430
你确定摧毁它是唯一的选择吗？
Are you certain its destruction is the only option?

172
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,590
恐怕是的
I am afraid so.

173
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,730
那就全力以赴吧
Then by all means

174
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,960
让我们照亮这最黑暗的时刻吧！
let us light our darkest hour!

175
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,270
汽车人 各就各位
Autobots, take your positions

176
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,580
听救护车指挥
and follow Ratchet's lead.

177
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,270
这里就交给我了
While I make my stand.

178
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,700
你的汽车人伙伴还算识时务 擎天柱
Your fellow Autobots are wise, Optimus.

179
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,020
他们知道什么时候应该撤退
They know when to retreat.

180
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,690
我没打算跟你整支军团硬拼 威震天
I hold no illusions about engaging your army, Megatron.

181
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,530
但我会让他们溃不成军…
But I might derail its objective...

182
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,480
我要擒贼先擒王！
by removing its head.

183
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,100
完全赞同 擎天柱
Highly and likely Optimus

184
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,030
因为强大的力量已集我于一身！
as I am infused with their very might!

185
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,390
不是你死 就是我亡！
One shall stand, one shall fall!

186
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,180
那些东西越来越近了
These things are getting closer.

187
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,370
情况不妙 对吧？
That's bad, right?

188
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,670
救护车 我们已经就位
Ratchet, we're in position.

189
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,890
阿尔茜 仔细看好
Arcee, pay close attention.

190
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,840
主人？
Master?

191
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,500
红蜘蛛 又怎么了？
Starscream, what is it?!

192
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,460
我不想质疑您运筹帷幄的智慧
I do not wish to question your all-seeing wisdom

193
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,750
但我认为 汽车人又在捣鬼
but I believe the Autobots are up to something again.

194
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,260
这次是在您的桥下
Beneath your bridge, this time.

195
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,490
声东击西啊 擎天柱
Uh, misdirection, Optimus?

196
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,550
你做霸天虎一定出类拔萃！
You would have made a fine Decepticon!

197
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,290
我已经选择了阵营！
I chose my side!

198
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,960
红蜘蛛 我的军队已经接近了
Starscream, my army approaches.

199
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,670
到太空桥会合 准备接应！
Rendezvous with the Space Bridge for pickup!

200
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,020
沿着流量调节器的线路走到能量泵
Now follow the line from the flow regulator to the energon pump.

201
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,640
那里应该有个阀门
There should be a valve.

202
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,880
我看到了
I see it.

203
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,900
好 让它用自己的能量进行爆破
Good. To turn all that power against itself

204
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,320
你只需要改变电流的方向
all you need do is reverse the current.

205
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,170
电流转向完成
Current reversed.

206
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,490
太好了！
Yes!

207
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,760
没错吧？
Right?

208
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,040
我去准备环陆桥
I'll ready the Ground Bridge.

209
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,800
红蜘蛛！我的飞船在哪儿？
Starscream! Where is my ship?

210
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,030
我们顶不住了 威震天陛下
We would never make it, Lord Megatron!

211
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,590
别犯傻了 上船撤退吧！
Don't be a fool! Take flight and retreat!

212
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,890
擎天柱 环陆桥已经准备就绪！
Optimus, the Ground Bridge is ready and waiting!

213
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,570
汽车人 跳桥！
Autobots, jump!

214
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,550
我的军团啊…
My legion!

215
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,600
不！
No!

216
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,230
霸天虎们 我怀着沉痛的心情
Decepticons, it is with deep sorrow

217
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,540
向大家宣告…
that I note for the log...

218
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,700
威震天的火种已经熄灭了
Megatron's spark has been extinguished.

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,450
红蜘蛛…万…岁！
All... hail... Starscream!

220
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,990
你觉得…他们…
Do you... think they're...

221
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,050
四个生命信号
Four life signals.

222
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,020
有一个非常微弱
One very faint.

223
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,240
隔板！
Bulkhead!

224
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,520
这周我们已经失去了一个
We lost one this week

225
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,950
看在火种源的份上 别再上演悲剧了
by the Allspark, don't let it be two.

226
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,500
阿尔茜…
Arcee...

227
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,030
杰克 不用伤心吧？
Jack, really?

228
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,820
世界上有的是摩托车
There are other motorcycles in the world.

229
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,510
可你是我的第一辆
But you're my first.

230
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,650
威震天怎么了？
And Megatron?

231
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,960
就算他也绝不可能在爆炸中心幸存
Not even he could've survived Ground Zero.

232
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,020
擎天柱！
Prime!

233
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,440
我还没谢过你 但你们救了我
I didn't get to thank you, but for the save

234
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,900
算我欠你的
I owe you one.

235
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,550
全人类欠你们的
We all do.

236
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,260
那么 现在是不是该说再见了
So, is this the part where you say good-bye

237
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,220
要我们忘记曾经见过你们吗？
and tell us we need to forget we ever saw you?

238
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,950
现在我们已经无法离开这个世界了
Without the means of leaving this world

239
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:01,530
但汽车人与三个年轻的朋友建立了友谊\N并从中得到力量
we Autobots take strength in the bonds we have forged with our three young friends.

240
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,940
他们是真正的勇士
True warriors

241
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,210
虽然身体弱小
if not in body

242
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,760
但拥有坚强的意志
then in spirit.

243
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,690
我的名字是擎天柱
My name is Optimus Prime.

244
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,050
我发出这条信息：
And I send this message:

245
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,260
虽然留在地球并非我们所选
Though we did no choose to be of earth

246
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,340
但既来之 则安之
it would seem that we are here to stay.

247
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,790
如果有人怀着敌意前来进犯
If you approach this planet with hostile intent

248
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,310
请记住：
know this:

249
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,440
我们会保卫自己
we will defend ourselves

250
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,730
我们会保卫人类
we will defend humanity.

251
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,580
我们会保卫我们共同的家园
We will defend our home.
