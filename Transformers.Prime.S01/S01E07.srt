1
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,480
不 我们还没到
No, we are not there yet

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,170
不过应该就在这山崖后面 大黄蜂
but it should be just past this ridge, Bumbobee.

3
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,970
我不明白 读数爆表了
I don’t get it. These readings are off the metre.

4
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,700
我跟你说过了 医生 我们没事！
I told you, doc, we are fine.

5
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,070
惟一确认你没事的方法 隔板
The only way to be certain you are fine, Bulkhead

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,950
是耐心接受标准除霜处理
is to enduring standard defrosting procedure.

7
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,560
你清楚长期暴露在低温下
You know prolonged exposure to sub-zero conditions

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,670
会造成永久性系统损伤
can cause permanent system damage.

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,680
救护车 我们在北极发现的东西你调查清楚了吗？
Ratchet, have you learned anything more about our Arctic find.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,980
还没有
Not yet.

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,620
舱门被冻住了 暂时打不开
The pod can’t be opened while it’s frozen solid.

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,590
阿尔茜和我去调查
Arcee and I will search for any clue

13
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,680
这个从北极来的东西究竟源自何方
which might explain the origin of our arctic find.

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,430
感应器一响就马上回来
Only until your sensors sound.

15
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,550
记住 如果你的核心温度降至蓝色区域
Remember, once your core temperature drops into the blue zone

16
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,260
很可能发生系统瘫痪 后果很严重
system failures are likely. They are eminent.

17
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,000
想我们了吗 机器医生？
Missed us doc bot?

18
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,470
他们不是应该在上学吗？
Uh, shouldn’t they be in school?

19
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,180
在星期六？我们整个周末都有空…来陪你
On Saturday? We have the whole weekend off, to spend with you.

20
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,580
我本来不想拼车的
I wasn’t expecting a car pool.

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,010
什么情况 阿尔茜？
What gives, Arcee?

22
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,080
很诱人 杰克
Tap team, Jack.

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,470
轮到我执行探索任务
It’s my turn for exploration duty.

24
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,080
噢 真不巧
Oh, too bad.

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,800
今天是个兜风的好日子
It’s a beautiful day for a ride.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,730
把我扔在家 你可能会有负罪感啊
Would hate for you to feel guilty for leaving me indoors.

27
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,800
北极探索任务
Arctic exploration duty.

28
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,560
那还是家里暖和
Indoor’s where is warm.

29
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,440
北极？
The Arctic?

30
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,440
我一直想去看雪呢
I’ve always wanted to see snow.

31
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,470
我很乐意邀你同行 拉斐尔
I would invite you to join, Raphael.

32
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,560
但那里的条件过于恶劣
But the conditions are much too extreme.

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
哪怕对我们汽车人来说
Even for we Autobots.

34
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,980
我…理解
I... understand.

35
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,580
不过 我会给你带一个雪球回来
But I will bring you back a snow ball.

36
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,110
那太棒了！
That would be awesome!

37
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,600
传送完成
Transport complete.

38
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,910
我的火种源啊！
Oh, by the Allspark.

39
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,020
那么 你们说今天该干什么？
So, what do you guys think we should do today?

40
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,220
电子游戏时间 看谁是最后的赢家！
Video game turn! The last one standing wins!

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,960
隔板 大黄蜂 赶快过来！
Bulkhead, Bumbobee! Here, now!

42
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,090
准备受死吧！
Prepare to be destroyed!

43
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,700
嗯 没错 我不太擅长这个 神子
Eh, yea, not really my thing, Miko.

44
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,190
噢 是怕输给女孩子吧？
Oh, scared of losing to a girl?

45
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,550
放马过来吧！
Uh, bring it!

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,050
绝不手软！
No mercy.

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,260
嘿 拉夫 想替我摆平神子吗？
Hey Raf, you want to take on Miko for me?

48
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,230
不 我有事要做
Nap, I have stuff to do.

49
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,890
老大不在 你也不能随便使唤我们啊！
You can't boss us around because the boss is out!

50
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,780
我需要人帮忙干活 环陆桥坏了！
I need some heavy lifting. The ground bridge is down.

51
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,350
擎天柱和阿尔茜出发顺利
Optimus and Arcee made it through just fine.

52
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,490
我担心的是怎么把他们接回来
It's bringing them back that concerns me.

53
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,610
现在把那些仪表搬开 要快！
Now remove those panels, chop, chop!

54
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,510
气温在零下并持续下降
Temperature sub-zero and dropping...

55
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,220
不行了…得返回…基地
Not a... get back... to base...

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,400
有人吗？
Hello?

57
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,240
你是哪儿来的？
Where did you come from?

58
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,400
汽车人从没提起过宠物
Haha. The Autobots never said anything about pets.

59
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,450
想玩接东西吗？
You wanna play fetch?

60
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,350
好孩子 去捡回来！
Uh, hehe good boy. Go get it.

61
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,290
不 别吃！
No, don’t eat that!

62
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,830
你会噎着的！
You’re gonna choke!

63
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,110
或许…不会？
...or not?

64
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
来吧 来吧 尝尝厉害…
Come on, come on. You want some...

65
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,180
大获全胜！
Ate your face!

66
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,540
怎…怎么回事？！
What the...

67
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,530
好极了 停电了！
Great, power fail.

68
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,910
啊 我们的游戏被中断了！
Eh, it wiped out our game!

69
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,550
你…怎么能
You, but, uh

70
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,140
我明明赢了！
I was winning!

71
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,200
认了吧
Bummer!

72
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,920
我们一定是遇到了什么问题
We definitely have a problem.

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,720
但到底是什么导致的这个…
But what could have caused this?

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,960
或是那个
Or that?

75
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,750
可能是主电网
Might be the main grid.

76
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,620
但愿不是配电站的问题
Hopefully it isn't a substation malfunctioning.

77
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,970
嘿 伙计们 瞧我找到了什么？
Hey guys, look what I found?

78
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,990
我们很忙！
We are busy! Ah!

79
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,260
嘿 嘿 你们怎么了？
Hey, hey, what's with you guys?

80
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,020
吸屑虫！吸屑虫！！！
Scraplet, scraplet!

81
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,900
吸屑虫是什么？
What's a scraplet?

82
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,050
塞博特恩有史以来最危险的害虫！
The most dangerous vermin ever to crawl upon the face of Cybertron.

83
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,410
就它？
A this?

84
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,090
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding me?

85
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,870
你们是巨型机器人！
You are giant robots!

86
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,010
而这虫虫…小得很
Scrappy here is tiny.

87
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,790
你没见识过这个小东西的破坏力！
You have no idea the damage that tiny thing could do!

88
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,240
啊 他不会伤害任何东西
Eh, he wouldn't hurt any thing.

89
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,750
行了 放松 小杀手
Alright, easy there, killer.

90
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,250
哇噢 我没想到会是这样
Whoa, I did not see that coming.

91
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,280
对不起 大黄蜂！
I'm sorry, Bumbobee.

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,630
你会好起来吗？
Is it gonna be OK?

93
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,910
只是皮外伤
Only a mesh wound

94
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,020
他死不了
he'll live.

95
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,570
你现在相信我了吧？
Now do you believe me?

96
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,910
吸屑虫会肢解机器 然后吃掉所有金属部分
All scraplets do is dismantle machinery and eat anything metal

97
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,580
尤其是活的金属！
especially living metal.

98
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,350
那么 虫子已经被打扁了 应该没事了吧？
Well, bug squashed, game over, right?

99
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,580
不！
No.

100
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,220
吸屑虫绝不会独来独往
When it comes to Scraplets there is never just one.

101
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,360
恐怕我知道他们是怎么进来的了
And I fear I know how they got in here.

102
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,780
这是个笼子
It’s a trap

103
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,060
用来抓吸屑虫的！
a Scraplet trap.

104
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,610
嗯…空的吸屑虫笼子？
Eh, an empty Scraplet trap?

105
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,290
可能是远古时期发射到太空的
Most likely ejected into space eons ago.

106
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,440
最终掉到了北极 低温使他们一直休眠
Only to wind up in the Arctic when the temperature kept them in stasis.

107
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,260
直到我们把他们弄出来
Until we brought the thaw.

108
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,120
现在他们苏醒过来 并蓄势待发
Now they are wide awaken and ready to branch.

109
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,520
那…
So...

110
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,450
他们有多少？
how many are we talking about?

111
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,890
成百上千
Thousands.

112
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,350
电力故障和环陆桥的损坏
The power malfunctions and ground bridge damage

113
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,200
明确表明他们正在侵蚀这里
are sure signs that their infestation is well under way.

114
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,460
阿尔茜 你的情况怎么样？
Arcee, what's your status?

115
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,680
我的感应器响了
My sensors' are going off.

116
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,460
我们最好在冻僵之前打道回府
Guess we should call for pick up before things get chilling.

117
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
擎天柱呼叫基地
Optimus to base

118
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,730
核心温度读数降至蓝色区域
core temperature readings have reached the blue zone.

119
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,130
准备启动环陆桥
Prepare to activate Ground Bridge.

120
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,660
救护车呼叫擎天柱 你能听到吗？
Ratchet to Optimus, do you read me?

121
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,170
我们遇到了麻烦
We have a situation.

122
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,450
吸屑虫侵入了通讯系统！
Scraplets have got into the com-link system.

123
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,970
如果我们不立即清除这些生物
If we don't eradicate these creatures immediately

124
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,350
他们会将整个基地变成一团废渣！
they will reduce the entire base to a scrappy.

125
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,110
我说我们还是开溜 让他们占领好了！
I say we bug out of here and let them keep it.

126
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,060
我们不能转移
Evacuation is not an option.

127
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,390
如果我们不修复环陆桥
If we don't get the Ground Bridge back online stat

128
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,770
擎天柱和阿尔茜会被冻死
Optimus and Arcee will perish.

129
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,670
那 好吧…
The... Well...

130
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,710
隔板 你从不退缩的！
Bulkhead, you never run!

131
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,920
神子 你没见过一群虫子活吃机器人的情景
Miko, you haven't seen the swarm of this thing devour a bot.

132
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,400
我见过
I have.

133
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,900
他们从里到外把你拆开
They pick you apart from the inside out.

134
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,760
从小而多汁的部分开始
Going for the small, juicy bits first

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,000
每根导线 每条电路
fuse by fuse, circuit by circuit

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,680
吃个精光！
till there's nothing left.

137
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,830
我说的是精光！
And I mean nothing!

138
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,270
连视觉电路都不剩
Not even your optics.

139
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,790
你得让我们帮忙
You have to let us help.

140
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,370
我们不是金属做的
We are not made of metal.

141
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,280
没错 吸屑虫伤不了我们
Yea, the Scraplets can't hurt us.

142
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,060
通常 我觉得你们的血肉之躯是最不中用的
Typically, I find your fleshiness to be your least engaging quality

143
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,490
但在极端情况下 似乎是一种优势
but it would appear to provide an advantage under these extremes.

144
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,930
很好
Ok, good.

145
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,580
我们结伴行动 一个汽车人配一个人类
So we pair off. One bot, one human.

146
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,900
我来掩护你维修环陆桥
I'll watch your back while you repair the Ground Bridge.

147
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,990
那我们就去杀虫
And we go in a bug hunt.

148
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,440
擎天柱呼叫基地 听到了吗？
Optimus to base, do you read.

149
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,550
你觉得我们来个千里奔袭如何？
Are you sure a nice long drive wouldn’t help?

150
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,990
我听说这个时节的迈阿密气候宜人
I hear Miami is beautiful this time of year.

151
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,680
最近的温带地区离这里太远了 阿尔茜
The nearest temperate climate is too distant, Arcee.

152
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,840
去那里要消耗太多能量
Attempting to reach it would expend too much energy

153
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,260
会加快冰冻的速度
and hasten the freezing process.

154
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,350
要坚持到救护车找到我们
Until Ratchet sense for us

155
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,000
他一定会的
and he will.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,740
眼下的明智之举是寻找避风港
Our best option will be to seek shelter

157
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,560
以保持体温
and insolate ourselves.

158
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,580
我能当一回你的保镖 多么酷啊！
I get to be your bodyguard for once, how cool is that?

159
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,780
拉斐尔在这儿发现了第一个 对吧？
Raphe found the first one here, right? Ahhhh!

160
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,080
你刚刚像小女孩一样尖叫了吗？
Did you just scream like a little girl?

161
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,140
没有！
No.

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,810
或许吧
Maybe.

163
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,860
我们以后再讨论这个好吗？
Can we talk about this later?

164
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,120
别紧张 隔板
Take it easy, Bulkhead.

165
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,930
集中精神就好 一切都会…
Just stay focused. Everything’s gonna be...

166
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,930
啊 我的天 离我远点！
Ah, my god, get out of me!

167
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,920
好吧 真希望我没看到这场面
OK, wish I hadn't seen that.

168
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,260
隔板 你没事！
Bulkhead, you are fine.

169
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,970
那只是一些电缆
It's just a bunch of cables.

170
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,060
嗯 对 电缆
Eh, ho, right. Cables. Hehe.

171
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,440
这些东西一直吃个不停吗？
Don't these things ever stop eating?

172
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,450
那边进展得怎么样了？
How's it going over there?

173
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,020
我修好了受损的导体
I've repaired the damaged conductors

174
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,050
重接了中央枢纽
and rerouted the central cond-roots;

175
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,050
可环陆桥还是无法恢复动力！
But Ground Bridge still won't receive power!

176
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,910
它们会飞？
They fly?

177
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,730
你从没说过他们会飞！
You never said they could fly!

178
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,950
救护车！
Ratchet!

179
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,450
用灭火器！
The fire-extinguisher!

180
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,210
救护车 准备急救包
Ratchet, get a patch kit.

181
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,210
我们的能量泄露得…哇哦！
We are leaking energon like... Wow!

182
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,010
吃这个吧！
Eat this! Ahhh!

183
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,950
阿尔茜 醒一醒！
Arcee, wake up.

184
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,770
我只是在闭目养神
Ugh. Just resting my eyes.

185
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,540
我们保持清醒越久
The longer we remain alert

186
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,650
就能存活越久
the longer we remain alive.

187
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,080
你有什么提议？
What do you suggest?

188
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,980
等等 不如玩个游戏？
Wait, how about a game?

189
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,850
我们来玩“猜猜基地里谁把事情搞砸了”
Let's play "Who screwed  things up back at base".

190
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,870
一个简单的故障就有可能导致我们现在的困境
Our predicament could be the result of a simple malfunction.

191
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,450
隔板惹的祸
Caused by Bulkhead.

192
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,790
想想看 通讯失灵 可能连动力都没了
Let's see. No com-link, maybe even no power.

193
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,400
那个大块头很可能绊倒在了某根线上
The big lug probably tripped over a cord.

194
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,240
他永远也学不会优雅
He's never been too graceful.

195
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,520
记得我们刚到地球的时候吗？
Remember when we first arrived on earth

196
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,800
隔板踩到了供电线路
and Bulkhead walked into those power lines?

197
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,940
谁能想象他手舞足蹈的样子？
Hmhm, who would know he can dance like that?

198
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,410
隔板对这个世界来说或许过大了
Bulkhead may be too large for this world

199
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,690
但他内在的力量与我们紧密相联
but his inner strength is with our bond.

200
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,430
不能单凭个头来评判一个人
One should not be measured by size along.

201
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,720
把他们全消灭了吗？
We get them all?

202
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,140
一部分
Partly.

203
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,810
这些只是侦察兵
These were just scouts.

204
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,730
那么…剩下的那些知道我们在这儿了？
So the... rest of them know we're in here?

205
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,600
如果我们成了他们的下一顿大餐
And if we allow ourselves to become their next meal

206
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,890
擎天柱和阿尔茜就再也回不来了
Optimus and Arcee will never make it home.

207
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,060
我们必须让环陆桥运作起来！
We must get the Ground Bridge operational.

208
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,630
然后用它把吸屑虫送到地球上的某处
Then we can use it to send Scraplets anywhere on earth.

209
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,430
直接送回北极怎么样？
Why not back to the Arctic?

210
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,160
我们已经知道他们怕冷
We already know that they don't do cold.

211
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,580
好主意！一举两得！
S-weet! One stop shopping!

212
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,460
根据吸屑虫的体质 零度以下的低温
Given the body mass of the Scraplets

213
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,090
应该能立即冻结他们
sub-zero condition should freeze them on contact.

214
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,850
快想 救护车 快想想！
So think, Ratchet, think!

215
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,060
如果环陆桥还不能工作
If the Ground Bridge is still down

216
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,500
只可能是能量输送管有裂口！
there must be a breach in the energon fuel line!

217
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,190
要不是我们也有裂口
If we weren't breaching

218
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,330
就可以派一个人去修好它
one of us can get back over there and fix it.

219
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,380
输送管在哪儿？
Where do we find it?

220
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,480
我们怎么修好它？
And how do we fix it?

221
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,000
别怕 我们没事
Remember, we are OK.

222
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,650
我们不是金属
We are not metal.

223
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,980
裂口在那儿！
There is the breach.

224
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,110
快！
Come on!

225
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,300
我们得快点！
We have to work fast!

226
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,240
如果我们能…
So if we get

227
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,630
撑到环陆桥开启时
when, we get the Ground Bridge open

228
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,370
是先把这些爬虫送出去
do we send the quippy crawlies out

229
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,270
还是先把自己人接回来？
or bring our bots in?

230
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,950
擎天柱和阿尔茜就像新鲜的鲜肉 如果他们先回来
Optimus and Arcee will be fresh meat.

231
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,240
吸屑虫是不会离开的
If we bring them in first, the Scraplets will have no reason to leave.

232
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,730
我们需要诱饵
We’ll need bait.

233
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,370
我们到哪儿去找诱饵？
Where are we gonna get bait?

234
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,310
吸屑虫早就把这儿当成自己家了！
The Scraplets are already helping themselves to everything in here!

235
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,170
他们准备开饭了！
They are getting ready to feed！

236
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,850
你知道最糟糕的是什么吗？
You know the worst part?

237
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,400
跟虎子们战斗了这么多年
After battling Cons all these years

238
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,790
被打躺过 射中过 炸飞过
getting smitten down, shot at, blown up

239
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
结果却是这么个死法？
this is how our lights go out?

240
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,710
阿尔茜 这或许不是我们意料中的结局
Arcee, This may not be the finish that we've planned

241
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,710
但如果真要在这里结束
but if this is indeed the end

242
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,090
如果我们要和火种源融为一体…
if we are to become one with the Allspark...

243
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,530
和你一起战斗很荣幸 擎天柱
It's been an honor serving with you, Optimus Prime.

244
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,050
救护车 全修好了！
Ratchet, all systems go!

245
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,270
发动它！
Fire it up!

246
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,570
环陆桥
Ground Bridge

247
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,630
启动…
activate...

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,220
诱饵 对吗？
Bait, eh?

249
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,890
准备好用主菜了吗？
Ready for the main course?

250
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,400
来吃我啊！
Come and get it! Ah!

251
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,650
卧倒 卧倒！
Down, down!

252
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,340
我邀请你们进来
I'd invite you in

253
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,330
不过家里一团糟
but the place is a mess.

254
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,140
汇报生化电路情况？
Report bio-circuitry status?

255
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,280
正在恢复中
Levels are rising.

256
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,310
很好
Excellent.

257
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,660
拉斐尔 看好大黄蜂的电脉冲监视器
Raphael, keep a close watch on Bumbobee's electro-pulse monitor.

258
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,890
神子 检查隔板的接口补丁
Miko, Check Bulkhead's interface patch.

259
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,980
情况稳定
It's steady.

260
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,950
一切正常！
Looking good.

261
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,150
或许你也该休息一下了 老朋友
Perhaps you should get yourself some rest, old friend.

262
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,930
你今天拯救了众多的生命
You saved quite a few lives today.

263
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,630
不…不全是我的功劳
It wasn't all my doing.

264
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,190
我们不过是幸运地赶上侵蚀发生在…
We're just fortunate that this infestation happened...

265
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,430
星期六
on a Saturday.

266
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,340
我们的人类朋友或许很渺小
Our human friends maybe small

267
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,010
但他们很强大
but they are strong.

268
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,060
又有吸屑虫？
A Scraplet?

269
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,360
蜘蛛！
Spider!

270
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,500
它爬我身上了吗？
Is it on me? Ah eh oh oh oh...

271
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,880
她刚刚像小女孩一样尖叫了吗？
Did she just scream like a little girl?
