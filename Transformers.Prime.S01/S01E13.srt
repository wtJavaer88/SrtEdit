1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,530
擎天柱 说了你也不信
Optimus, you are not going to believe this.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,970
我刚刚完成了对霸天虎战舰的精确定位
I just pinpointed the location of the Decepticon warship.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,560
他们的隐身技术被你破解了吗？
How did you penetrate their cloaking technology?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,880
我没破解
I didn't.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,640
我是在试验各种频段波长时 偶然发现的
I was experimenting the variable frequency wavelengths when I stumbled upon it.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:25,140
而且 他们的飞船一定受到了某种电磁破坏
Even still, their ship must be experiencing some kind of electromagnetic breach.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,730
威震天死了 趁他们疏于防范…
With Megatron deceased and the element of surprise...

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,320
我们可以来个当头一棒
We can cause some serious damage.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,840
同一个频率上 还发现了汽车人紧急信标
Also in the same frequency, an Autobot emergency beacon.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,320
霸天虎的事先放一放 很可能有汽车人遇难
The Decepticons can wait, there maybe Autobots in distress.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,750
救护车 带上医疗包
Rachet, bring your medical kit.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,640
飞船迫降 看来已经坠毁几百年了
A crash landing, buried here for centuries.

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,010
如果他们是在休眠模式下航行 或许还有幸存者
If they traveled in stasis mode, there may be survivors.

14
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,700
擎天柱 这些汽车人并不是死于飞船失事
Optimus, these Autobots didn't perish in the crash.

15
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,110
他们的症状…像是感染了病毒
They are displaying the effects of a virus.

16
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,670
这是艘瘟船
This is a plague ship.

17
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,560
什么都别碰！
Don't touch anything.

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,420
病毒可能还有活性
The virus could still be active.

19
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,200
不！
No!

20
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,430
是灰死病
Cybonic plague.

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,430
（Cybonic plague影射Bubonic plague，即黑死病）
Cybonic plague.

22
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,570
（Cybonic plague影射Bubonic plague，即黑死病）
It's only contagious if contact is made with the infected energeon.

23
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,570
只有在接触被感染能量时才会被传染
It's only contagious if contact is made with the infected energeon.

24
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,860
汽车人飞船里怎么会有瘟疫呢？
What was a plague doing in an Autobot spaceship?

25
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,780
飞船上有被感染的乘客
Its passengers were infected.

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,770
塞博特恩大战时期 这种病毒夺去了无数生命
The virus wiped out millions on Cybertron during the great war.

27
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,960
灰死病是霸天虎生物战争计划的产物
Cybonic plague was engineered in the Decepticons' Biological Warfare Program...

28
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,610
由威震天亲自研发
by Megatron himself.

29
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,940
你…有解药 是吧？
You have a cure, don't you?

30
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,840
无药可救…
No cure...

31
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,370
擎天柱 拜托 保存一点体力吧
Optimus, please, save your strength.

32
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,120
威震天能制造病毒 怎么会不造解药？
Would Megatron create a disease without having a cure?

33
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,210
我是说 万一他不小心感染了怎么办？
I mean what if he caught it by accident?

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,800
可我们没法拷问威震天了 杰克
It's not like we can ask Megatron, Jack.

35
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,460
他已经上西天了
He's pushing up lugnuts.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,880
但是 没准可以查询霸天虎的数据库
But we might be able to access the Decepticon database.

37
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,990
目前 我们还掌握着他们战舰的位置
For the moment, we still have a fix on their warship's location.

38
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,950
大黄蜂 跟我走
Bumblebee, come with.

39
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,830
阿尔茜 尽快吧
Arcee, quickly.

40
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,720
我们从实验室开始找
Let's start with the lab.

41
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,490
我进入他们的网络了
I'm in the network.

42
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,960
救护车…
Rachet...

43
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,960
你有没有…
Were you...

44
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,510
被感染？没有
Infected? No.

45
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,740
数据真在这里吗 我没找到
If it's here, I don't see it.

46
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,790
你能确定吗 阿尔茜？
Are you certain, Arcee?

47
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,130
我搜索了所有文件 没找到
I searched every file, nothing.

48
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,540
那就再找一遍！你肯定有遗漏！
Well, search again! Clearly you missed something!

49
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,240
整个数据库我都扫描遍了！
I scanned the entire database.

50
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,060
你用过冗余量子算法吗？
Did you use a redundant quantum algorithm?

51
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,690
别用那些名词吓唬我
Don't tell me how to research.

52
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,810
你以为只有你自己关心擎天柱吗？
You think you are the only one who cares about Optimus?

53
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,020
怎么回事？
What is it?

54
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,430
怎么了？出什么事了？
What is it? What's going on?

55
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,910
是威震天
It's Megatron.

56
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,560
他还…活着
He's alive.

57
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,180
什么？
What?

58
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,890
那不可能！
That's not possible!

59
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,690
可我看见的确实是他
But I'm staring right at him.

60
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,180
好消息是
Good news is

61
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,780
威震天没有回应我的目光
Megatron isn't exactly staring back.

62
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,870
威震天？
Megatron?

63
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,560
他不行了 全靠生命维持系统撑着
He's critical, hooked up to life support.

64
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,580
该把他一劳永逸地解决掉了
Time to finish this once and for all.

65
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,570
慢着！别动手！
Wait! Don't!

66
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,460
给我个好理由 快说！
One good reason, fast!

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,990
威震天或许是救活擎天柱的唯一希望
Megatron may be Optimus's only hope for survival.

68
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,410
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,390
他的脑电波还有活动吗？
Does he display brainwave activity?

70
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,950
很强烈 他的病态思维仍在运转
Spiking hard, his sick mind still at work.

71
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,270
太好了！如果真的有解药 威震天可能是唯一知道底细的人
Perfect. If a cure exists, Megatron maybe the only one who knows it.

72
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,460
你们必须进入他的大脑 找到解药！
You must enter his brain and find it.

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,180
进入威震天的大脑？
Enter Megatron's brain?

74
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,060
救护车 你是不是疯了？
Rachet, are you out of your fragging mind?

75
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,620
霸天虎实验室应该有所需的全部设备 你可以执行大脑皮层通灵驳接
The Decepticon laboratory should contain all the equipment you need for a cortical psychic patch.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,440
不行 你以前有没有执行过这套程序？
No way. Have you ever even performed the procedure?

77
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,830
没有 但我仔细研究过理论资料…
No. But I have thoroughly studied the theoretical literature...

78
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,450
它是霸天虎发明的 但被汽车人明令禁止
invented by Decepticons, outlawed by Autobots.

79
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,000
哇 我们用环陆桥把威震天运走 时间不是会充裕一点吗？
Whoa, can't we just haul Megatron through the GroundBridge, buy us some time to figure this out?

80
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,700
擎天柱可没有那么充裕的时间！
Time is one thing that Optimus does not have!

81
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,540
你们俩必须有人试一下！
One of you must try this！

82
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,520
我绝不容许在威震天归西之前 就要给擎天柱送终！
I will not allow Optimus to pass knowing that Megatron will outlive him!

83
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,870
救护车 我愿意为擎天柱拼命 无论何时何地
Ratchet, I would lay down my life for Optimus, anytime, anywhere.

84
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,020
可要说灵魂出窍…
But a mind-body split...

85
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,040
你要去吗？
You will?

86
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,800
你有…把握吗 大黄蜂？
Are you... sure, Bumblebee?

87
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,960
小蜂是我们最棒的侦察兵
Bee's the best scout there is.

88
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,480
电磁防护罩为什么还没修好？
Why has the elctromagnetic shielding not been repaired?

89
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,220
舰员正在尽全力抢修 陛下…
The crews are working as quickly as they can, Lord...

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,610
我们的航迹暴露了！
We are leaking a trail!

91
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,050
汽车人只要访问正确的频段波长 就能获得我们的准确位置
All the Autobots need do to pinpoint our position is to access the correct frequency wavelength.

92
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,840
动作再快点！
Accelerate your efforts!

93
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,070
遵命 红蜘蛛陛下
Yes, Lord Starscream.

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,840
医官报到
Doctor in the house.

95
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,040
啊 击倒 病人今天状况如何？
Ah, Knock Out, and how is the patient doing today?

96
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,670
老样子…
Same old...

97
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,240
保持这种植物人状态 真是让他无地自容
An inglorious fate that he should remain in this vegetative state...

98
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,610
正相反 威震天的身体也许成了废铁
On the contrary, Megatron's body may be scrap metal

99
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,420
但他的思维还是很活跃的
but his mind is still percolating.

100
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,210
你自己知道就行了！
Keep that to yourself!

101
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,110
那该死的声波好像有千里眼和顺风耳
That blasted Soundwave sees and hears everything.

102
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,930
他是霸天虎的耳目嘛
The eyes and ears of the Decepticons.

103
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,260
只要他们的主子一天不醒 他们就是群无头苍蝇
Well, as long as their master remains in limbo, so does their cause.

104
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,630
霸天虎急需一位强悍的 警醒的领袖
The Decepticons deserve a strong, alert leader.

105
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,640
这位领袖也需要一个忠诚的副官
One who would require a loyal second-in-command.

106
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:45,020
要想坐上副官的位置 必须干得漂亮点 才能让那个“耳目”闭嘴
Hmhmhm, a candidate would need to earn that post by making a strong case to said eyes and ears.

107
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,240
需要发发慈悲吗 红蜘蛛陛下？
A case for showing mercy, Lord Starscream?

108
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,430
你敬我一尺 我敬你一丈
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

109
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,470
救护车 我们准备好了
Ratchet, we are ready.

110
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,150
启动大脑皮层通灵驳接
Initiate cortical psychic patch.

111
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,170
通讯下行链路激活
Communications downlink activated.

112
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,910
这样我们就能利用大黄蜂的视觉和听觉
This will allow us to see and hear everything Bumblebee does

113
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,310
进入威震天的潜意识
while within Megatron's subconscious mind.

114
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,310
哇 那是什么地方？
Whoa, where is that?

115
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,720
小蜂说那儿像是卡隆 霸天虎在塞博特恩上的首都
Bee says it looks like Kaon, the Decepticon Capital back on Cybertron.

116
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,920
老救 大哥的情况很差
Ratch, Optimus's vitals.

117
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,270
我知道
I know.

118
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,120
快点 大黄蜂
Quickly, Bumblebee.

119
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,810
我知道那是个陌生环境
I know you are in unknown territory

120
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,640
但你必须在威震天的意识里 找到信息的大致储存位置
but you must figure out where information might be filed in Megatron's mind.

121
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,510
大黄蜂 那不是擎天柱
Bumblebee, that is not Optimus

122
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,310
只是威震天的思维幻像
but a figment of Megatron's mind.

123
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,480
他看不见 也听不到你
It cannot see or hear you.

124
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,050
哈哈 擎天柱！
Mmmmhahaha, Optimus Prime!

125
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,430
你的汽车人部队战败了
Your Autobot armies are defeated.

126
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,250
向你的新主人鞠躬吧
Bow before your new master.

127
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,590
我决不低头 威震天
Never, Megatron.

128
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,490
不是你死 就是我亡
One shall stand, one shall fall.

129
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,360
那就来吧
So be it.

130
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,680
这事我可没见过
That never happened.

131
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,290
这不是记忆
It's not a memory.

132
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,200
我们看见的卡隆 是威震天在他的黑暗梦境里重建的
We're seeing Kaon as Megatron has recreated it in his darkest dreams.

133
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,330
威震天 你的恶行到此为止吧
Megatron, your treachery ends here.

134
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,070
汽车人侦察兵
The Autobot scout.

135
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:44,170
胆敢擅闯我的领地 我让你灰飞烟灭！
The punishment for trespassing in my domain is your destruction!

136
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,930
这怎么可能？
How can this be?

137
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,850
威震天碰不到小蜂吗？
Megatron can't touch Bee?

138
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,140
因为他不是威震天的意识产物
Because he's not a creation of Megatron's mind

139
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,320
大黄蜂对他的物理攻击免疫
Bumblebee is immune to his physical attack.

140
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,490
你没有穿戴相移盔甲
You are not wearing phase displacement armor.

141
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,510
你的眼睛可以追踪我的动作 说明你不是全息图像
Your eyes track my movements, so you are not a hologram.

142
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,110
我也不相信灵魂论
And I do not believe in spirits.

143
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,090
快告诉我 侦察兵 你是什么东西？
So tell me, scout, what are you?

144
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,990
威震天！
Megatron!

145
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,690
啊哦 特邀嘉宾来了
Uho, special guest stars.

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,850
这可不太妙
This is not good.

147
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,260
你是真实的 他们不是！
You are real. They were not!

148
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,580
大脑皮层通灵驳接
Hehehe, a cortical psychic patch.

149
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,230
真想不到啊
How unexpected.

150
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,530
我们扰乱了威震天的无意识状态
We've stirred Megatron from his oblivion.

151
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,500
他开始恢复自我意识了！
He's becoming self-aware.

152
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,800
如果这是我的潜意识
If this is my subconscious

153
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,560
你在我的脑子里干什么？
what are you doing inside my head?

154
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,110
加油 小蜂 你到底在干嘛？
Come on, Bee. What are you doing in there?

155
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:50,190
击倒 麻烦你向声波讲一下 专家的治疗意见
Knock Out, if you would be so kind as to provide your expert medical opinion to Soundwave

156
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,130
以便记录在案
for the historical record.

157
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,950
简单来说 如果没有外力协助 威震天会永远保持这种假死状态
Simply put, unaided, Megatron could remain in this deadless slumber forever.

158
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,100
我们的主人不会希望自己成为这个样子
Our master would not have wanted to be seen this way.

159
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:11,550
眼看着他的灵魂被禁锢 我们却无所事事 这不公平
To stand idly by while he remains captive in his own body, is not just.

160
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,990
脑电波的活动不能证明他拥有意识 只是陷入了无穷的梦境
Brainwave activity, not evidence of consciousness, but merely of an endless dream

161
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,220
威震天或许永远都无法醒过来
from which Megatron may never wake.

162
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,080
声波 我们必须面对现实
Soundwave, we must face reality.

163
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,120
我们已经痛失威震天
Megatron is lost to us.

164
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,630
唯一体面的选择 就是让他解脱
The only honorable option, would be to show him mercy.

165
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,500
只是拨动一个开关而已
A simple throw off the switch.

166
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,410
迅速 没有痛苦 充满怜悯
Quick, painless, compassionate.

167
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,730
救护车 你听到了吗？
Ratchet, are you hearing this?

168
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,770
如果威震天死了
If Megatron perishes

169
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,410
大黄蜂的意识就会和他的身体分离 永远分离
Bumblebee's mind will remain separated from his body, forever.

170
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,940
那我们岂不要同时失去大黄蜂和擎天柱？
We'll lose Bumblebee and Optimus?

171
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:04,590
你能进入我的意识的唯一办法 就是通过大脑皮层通灵驳接
The only way you could have entered my mind, is via cortical psychic patch.

172
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,650
但是还有问题
But the question remains...

173
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,010
我到底是怎么了？
What happened to me?

174
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,650
太空桥爆炸
The SpaceBridge explosion.

175
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:40,050
另外 如果你能进入我的大脑 就说明我还没彻底死亡
And yet if, if you're in my head, I am not one with the Allspark.

176
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,900
告诉我 侦察兵 我是不是还活着？
So tell me, scout, do I still function?

177
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,810
大黄蜂 我们没时间了！
Bumblebee, we are out of time!

178
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,410
灰死病？
Cybonic plague?

179
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,080
除了我自己 还有人被…感染了？
Somebody beside myself is, is unwell?

180
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,470
擎天柱！
Optimus!

181
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,050
真是讽刺！
Such irony!

182
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,030
经历了连年的战争
That after ages of endless battle

183
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:21,290
伟大的擎天柱居然在远古时代的 简单病毒面前败下阵来！
the mighty Optimus Prime is fell by a simple virus from the distant past!

184
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,320
你凭什么以为 我会出手拯救我的老对头？
And what makes you think I would save the life of my oldest enemy?

185
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,790
威震天 你的恶行…
Megatron, your treachery is...

186
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,240
噢 那么我最想要的是什么呢 侦察兵？
Oh, and just what is it that I want most, scout?

187
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,870
你没看到吗 擎天柱可以被我亲手杀死
Haha, did you not see, I do slay Optimus by my own hand

188
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,490
我随心所欲 想杀就杀！
at will, whenever I desire!

189
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,780
小蜂告诉威震天 如果他让病毒毁掉擎天柱的话
Bee told Megatron if he lets the plague virus destroy the real Optimus

190
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,390
他就再也没机会亲自动手了
Megatron will never get the chance to do it himself.

191
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,850
聪明！
Smart!

192
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,110
变态！
Twisted!

193
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:14,590
声波 我可不可以认为 你用沉默来表示认同击倒的专业见解？
Soundwave, do I take your silence to mean you concur with Knock Out's medical expertise?

194
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,150
要么开口 要么永远闭上你的臭嘴
Speak now, or forever hold your peace.

195
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,610
说啊…
Going.

196
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
说啊…
Going...

197
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,340
糟了！
Scrap!

198
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:55,260
这么多恩恩怨怨都走过来了 如果不能亲眼看到擎天柱熄灭火种的话…
After our deep history together, to not watch the spark end from Optimus's eyes with my very own...

199
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,790
干得好 侦察兵
Well-played, scout.

200
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,730
这就是你要找的解药配方
The chemical formula for the cure you seek.

201
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,740
我并不指望你能读懂
Not that I expect you to know how to read it.

202
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,890
现在不行
Not yet.

203
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,190
既然你提议 让我亲手终结擎天柱的生命
And how am I to accomplish terminating Optimus as you proposed

204
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,550
可我怎么能摆脱这个无限循环的白日梦呢？
while I'm traped here in a perpetual day-dream?

205
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,680
只要你帮我逃出这个监狱 就可以得到解药
Once you release me from this prison, you will have the cure.

206
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,750
快点 快点！
Come on, come on.

207
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:46,130
你必须保证让我复原 否则\N擎天柱只能变灰 然后死掉
You must guarantee my recovery, or Optimus fades to gunmetal grey.

208
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,280
我说的是真正的擎天柱
The REAL Optimus.

209
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,990
阿尔茜 配方已经到手
Arcee, we have the formula.

210
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,690
断开大黄蜂的驳接 快！
Disconnect Bumblebee, now!

211
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,900
你们在监视 你骗了我！
You were watching, you tricked me!

212
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,260
不！带我一起走！带我走…
No, take me with you! Take me! Take me! Take me!

213
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,720
快点啊 小蜂！
Hurry, Bee.

214
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,170
怎么…
What in...

215
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,360
入侵者！
Intruders!

216
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,550
让我来吧！
Allow me!

217
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,530
唉 结局在所难免
Huh, it was the inevitable outcome.

218
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:04,000
当然了 不该让威震天牺牲在汽车人的手里
Uhhh... of course it would be wrong to allow Megatron to perish by an Autobot's hand

219
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,320
击倒
Knock Out.

220
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,110
就这样 稳住
That's it. Steady.

221
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:35,100
请各位把对英雄的欢呼留给我的医师 还有我的侦察兵
Please, reserve the hero's welcome for my physician, and my scout.

222
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,500
- 没事了\N- 是啊！
- Alright.\N- Yes!

223
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,440
病人今天的情况如何？
And how is the patient doing today?

224
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,460
这话问得好
Funny, you should ask.

225
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,040
不清楚汽车人在他脑子里动了什么手脚
Not sure what the Bots did in there.

226
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,340
但是威震天的脑电波已经归零了
But Megatron's registering zero brainwave activity.

227
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,000
嗯 说明什么？
Mmm, meaning?

228
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,580
表面来看他很稳定 但现在
Physically he is stable, but now

229
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,500
他的…灵魂消失了
there is no one home.

230
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,400
我出来了
I'm out.

231
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,140
或许该说…进来了！
Or should I say, IN!
