1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,430
嗯？稳定得不可思议
Hmm? Surprisingly stable.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,000
嘿 救护车 那是人造能量吗？
Hey Ratchet, is that Synthetic Energon?

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,960
嗯 是的
Well, yes.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,460
实际上我正准备测试这些样本
In fact I'm preparing to test the sample.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,320
看来你戴了护目镜
I see that you come equipped with protective goggles.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,670
我可以看了？
I can watch?

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,850
哈哈 只需要往测试引擎中注入一些
Haha, We just add some to the test engine.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,940
起作用了！小蜂！
It works! Bee!

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,390
等一下 等一下
Dah, dah dah?

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,870
在我们考虑将它用来制造燃料
This iteration of the formula requires further trial

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,270
弹药 或是急救品之前
before we could even think about using it for fuel

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,900
这个配方样本需要进一步的实验
ammunition or first aid

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,550
很不幸 因为我们的能量储备一向不足
which is rather unfortunate since our own reserves are in all time low.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,700
敌众我寡 我们的战士为了对付霸天虎而疲于奔命 迅速地消耗着能量储备
Our severely outnumbered warriors have been rapidly burdening through our stockpile of late

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,500
造成了霸天虎始终在较量中占据上风
as the Decepticon army continues to run us and ground us down.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,960
天然能量在你们的星球上十分稀缺
Natural Energon is in such short supply on your planet

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,130
而且看起来威震天的脏手已经遍布地球
and Megatron seems to have his oily claws buried deep in all the earth deposits.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,180
但是 如果我们能成功制造出人造能量
But, if we can successfully produce a synthetic form

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,630
就能解决所有的能源需求问题
we can manufacture all the energy we'll ever need.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,020
有移动的能量矿石信号
Raw Energon on the move.

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,430
又来了
Again.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,500
最近的动向表明 他们又重操旧业了
Their recent activity suggests a familiar pattern.

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,270
霸天虎们急于探测出新的能量矿
The Decepticons are desperately scouting for new deposits to mine.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
汽车人…
Autobots...

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,620
擎天柱 如果你们这次回来的时候有人受伤的话 那个
Optimus, if one of you comes back wounded this time, well...

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
我们能量储备已经几乎耗尽了
our Energon reserves are nearly depleted.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,750
我懂了
Understood.

28
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,000
启动环陆桥
Activate the Ground Bridge.

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,960
汽车人 出发
Autobots, roll out.

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,700
有时候我真希望自己能派上用场
Sometimes, I wish I could do more.

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,780
救护车 醒一醒！
Ratchet, wake up!

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,250
呃？
Ugh?

33
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,240
你人不大 嗓门倒是不小啊？
How is it that such small beings can be so loud.

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
你受伤了吗？你摔倒了
Are you hurt? You fell.

35
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,170
我很好 我…
I'm fine. I'm...

36
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,710
…好得不得了
more than fine.

37
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,310
哈 能量效率提升了三成？
Hah, energy efficiency is of thirty percent?

38
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,410
马达功能处于最佳状态？
Motor functions optimal?

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,500
其他人那儿有什么消息吗？
Any word from the others?

40
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,360
击倒 我们就不能直接传送走人吗？
Knock Out, can't we just Bridge out of here?

41
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,480
这个方块背起来很重
This cube is putting some serious drag on me.

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,140
我们给汽车人制造的麻烦越多
The more we give the Autobots a work out

43
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,730
他们消耗的能量就越多
the more fuel they burn.

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,590
然后我们就能赢得这场能量竞赛
And we win the Energon race.

45
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,140
何况 空中支援来了
Besides, here comes air support.

46
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,360
阿尔茜 后撤 他们人太多了！
Arcee, fall back, you are out-numbered!

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
我们向来都是以寡敌众
We are always out-numbered.

48
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,800
我们需要那个能量！
We need that Energon!

49
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,690
救护车 锁定阿尔茜的坐标
Ratchet, lock on to Arcee's coordinates

50
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,690
准备紧急传送
and prepare an emergency Ground Bridge.

51
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,760
我锁定了
I'm locked up.

52
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,160
阿尔茜 减速 准备返回基地
Arcee, decelerate and prepare to return to base.

53
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,070
省省吧 救护车 我和对方靠得太近了
Save it, Ratchet, I'm too close.

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,680
别做傻事！
Don't be a fool!

55
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,040
她受伤了
She's hurt.

56
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,220
操纵环陆桥
Man the Ground Bridge.

57
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,970
呼呀！！
HOOAAH!

58
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,130
救护车？
Ratchet?

59
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,730
看来汽车人来了个开外挂的
Looks like the Autobots brought in a ringer.

60
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,340
那我们就让他现形吧
Well then I'll ring his bell.

61
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,730
你得等下次了
You'll have to wait.

62
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,670
呼呀！
HOOAAH!

63
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,770
发生了什么？
What happened?

64
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,600
我只看到辉煌的战果
I only saw the glory aftermath

65
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,080
但听起来医生上演了一出单骑破敌的好戏
but I hear the doc was on one Bot ragging machine.

66
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,390
哇！
Whoa...

67
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,680
噢 嘿 小家伙
Oh, hey, little fella.

68
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,010
好吧 你的秘密是什么？
Alright, what's you secret.

69
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,640
没什么秘密
No secret

70
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,300
只是一种我喜欢称它为“合能”的东西
just a thing something I like to call Synthen.

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,570
按照隔板记录下来的那些数据合成出来的？
From the data Bulkhead transcribed?

72
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,910
我以为方程式是…
I thought the formula was...

73
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,800
…不完整的？呵呵 不再是了
Incomplete? Hehe, not anymore.

74
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,030
救护车作为猛男要远胜我的聪明才智？
So Ratchet makes a better tough guy than I do a smart guy?

75
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,900
救护车 我质疑你用自己做试验是否明智
Ratchet, I question the wisdom of using yourself as a test subject.

76
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,260
擎天柱 你没看到救护车当时的表现
Optimus, you didn't see Ratchet out there.

77
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,990
简直是大暴发啊
He was an overdrive.

78
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,760
我们都应该试试这个
We should all try this stuff.

79
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,180
或者让救护车多喝点 然后我们就能放个假了
Or give Ratchet more so we can take a vacation.

80
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,300
我承认初期的效果颇为令人期待
I agree that the initial results seem promising

81
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,130
但我建议在机器上做进一步的测试
but I recommend that further testing be confined to machines

82
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,550
而不是在汽车人身上
not Autobots.

83
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,670
虽然现在是敌众我寡 老朋友
Out-numbered, though, we may be, old friend.

84
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,930
但比起战场上的战士
We need a warrior in the laboratory right now

85
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,520
我们现在更需要的是实验室里的战士
more than we need another in the field.

86
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,330
然后 他直接朝我扑过来 于是我
And then, he came right at me, and I...

87
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,390
嗯… 来 小隔 过来打我
well, come on, Bulk, come at me.

88
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,770
我可不想伤到你 老救
I don't want to hurt you, Ratch.

89
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,960
我说 打我！
I said, come at me!

90
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,410
呼呀！
HOOAAH!

91
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,040
那是怎么回事？
What was that?

92
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,650
你有竞争对手了 小隔
You have competition, Bulk.

93
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,490
我比之前要强壮一些
I'm a bit stronger than I used to be.

94
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,920
速度也快了一点 嘿嘿嘿
Also a bit fast, hehaha...

95
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,780
要跟我较量下吗 肌肉车？
Say you could take me, muscle car?

96
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,940
胆小鬼 感觉怎么样？
Wimp. How’s it hummin?

97
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,790
他是不是有些…
Did he just?

98
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,820
更强 更快 更流氓了
Stronger, faster, studlier.

99
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,590
我要始终保持最佳状态
I need to be at the top of my game.

100
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,610
这关乎我们的生死存亡
Our survival depends upon it.

101
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,380
看起来虎子们又找到了一个矿脉
Looks like the Cons hit another vein.

102
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,730
汽车人 出发
Autobots, roll out.

103
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,500
嘿 嘿 我们不应该等等我们的秘密武器吗？
Heyhey, shouldn't we wait for our secret weapon?

104
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,410
这次任务不需要医疗专家
This mission is unlikely to require medical expertise.

105
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,130
但万一你需要额外的火力支援呢？
But you'll never know if you may require additional fire power.

106
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,720
大黄蜂可以操作环陆桥
Bumblebee can handle Ground Bridge duty.

107
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,010
是时候去痛打一顿那些霸天虎了
Time to put some hurt on those Decepticons.

108
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,000
信号很微弱
The signal is weak.

109
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,200
他们就算找到一个矿脉
They may have hit a vein

110
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,610
也找不到多少能量
but they won't find much of Energon pulse

111
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,890
起码这里没戏
not here.

112
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,980
威震天像我们一样急于找到能量
I take some comfort in the fact that Megatron seems as

113
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,930
这个事实倒令人宽慰
desperate to find the stuff as we are.

114
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,290
你们两个在任务中总是这么废话连篇吗？
Do you two always talk this mush during these missions?

115
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,810
汽车人！
Autobots!

116
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,750
没事了
It's alright.

117
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,820
我是一辆救护车
I'm an emergency vehicle.

118
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,910
干吗这么急？
Why the big rush?

119
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,000
我只是想离汽车人臭虫远点
Just trying to get as far as I can from the Autobot stink.

120
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,900
你的老大知道你有一张臭嘴吗？
Does your boss know you have a potty mouth?

121
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,380
也许我该拜访他一下 顺便告诉他
Maybe I should pay him a visit and tell him.

122
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,400
你该进熔毁炉 死轮子
Get melted, wheel-grinder.

123
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,390
熔毁？好提议
Melted? Now there is the concept.

124
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,240
我不会再问第二遍
I won't ask you a second time--

125
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,630
威震天在哪儿？
where is Megatron?

126
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,370
不 不…不！！
No, no--Nooooo!!

127
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,760
我知道的就这些了 真的！
That's all I know, really!

128
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,790
敬酒不吃吃罚酒
Now was that so difficult?

129
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,950
救护车 你在干什么？
Ratchet, what are you doing?

130
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,890
问口供
Get results.

131
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,450
也破坏了原则
And breaking protocol.

132
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,610
那是个霸天虎仆从 劳工等级
That was a Decepticon minor, servant class.

133
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,420
不是战士级别的
Not warrior class.

134
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,420
哦 让我猜你要说什么：我只是个医疗兵
Oh, let me guess: I'm just the medic.

135
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,450
除非万不得已 汽车人从不伤害他人
Autobots do not inflict harm unless all other options have been exhausted.

136
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,390
这就是我们和霸天虎之间的不同之处
It is what separates us from the Decepticons.

137
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,690
哈！现在是讲大道理的时候吗 擎天柱？
Ha! Is this really the time for another lecture, Optimuse?

138
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,420
碰巧发现威震天所在位置的人不是你 对吧？
You didn't just happen to discover Megatron's current location, did you?

139
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,790
而我做到了
Well, I did.

140
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,780
你知道哪里能找到大量的能量矿藏吗？
And you happen to know where there is a stockpile of raw Energon right for the taking?

141
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,370
我知道！
I do!

142
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,360
行了 救护车 冷静点
Come on, Ratchet. Calm it down.

143
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,250
冷静这东西毫无是处！
Calm is the last thing we need!

144
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,380
是冷静让我们失去了塞博特恩！
Calm is what lost us Cybertron!

145
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,720
虎子们有战舰 军队
The Cons have a warship, an army

146
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,450
频繁的能量探测活动
all this Energon scouting.

147
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,350
你不认为威震天在酝酿什么大动作吗？
You think Megatron isn't gearing up for something big?

148
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,460
我们浪费了大量资源
We are squandering our resources

149
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,340
却只能捡他们的残渣剩饭
chasing after his crumbs.

150
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,430
我们本应该去揍他们
When we really should be hitting him hard

151
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,690
现在就去揍他们
and hitting him now...

152
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,370
狠狠地戳到他们的痛处
precisely where it hurts!

153
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,690
直接攻击霸天虎只会招来报复行为…
A direct assault on the Decepticons would only provoke retaliation...

154
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,170
并且导致无法估算的损失
and lead to incalculable losses.

155
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,860
我不会让无辜的人类也卷入危险
I will not endanger innocent human lifes.

156
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,400
但你却不介意将我们卷入危险！
Yet you seem to have no problem endangering ours!

157
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,160
问问飞过山吧！
Just ask Cliffjumper!

158
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,530
噢 我忘记了！
Oh, I forgot!

159
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,090
他今天已经不可能出现在这里了！
He couldn't be here today!

160
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,800
够了！
That's it!

161
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,620
你知道你的问题吗 擎天柱？
You know your problem, Optimus?

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,610
你是个如此高大 如此强壮的汽车人
For such a big, strong Bot...

163
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,500
却如此…优柔寡断
you're soft.

164
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,460
你没有抓住机会把威震天砸成废铁！
You didn't pound Megatron into scrap when you had the chance!

165
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,370
错失了那么多良机！
Many chances, in fact!

166
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,290
恐怕人造能量影响了你的判断力 老朋友
I'm afraid that the Synthetic Energon has impaired you judgement, old friend.

167
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,080
我命令你不得离开基地 直至接到新命令
I am confining you to base until further notice.

168
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,940
大黄蜂 把我们传送回去
Bumblebee, bridge us back.

169
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,220
好吧…
Fine...

170
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,650
呼！呀！
Ummmm! Yahhhh!

171
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,740
无法定位救护车的坐标
Can't get a fix on Ratchet's coordinates.

172
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,760
那自负的人造能量一定搅乱了他的信号
That bogus Energon must be scrambling his signal.

173
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,350
继续尝试
Keep trying.

174
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,520
我们必须找到救护车
We've got to find Rathcet

175
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,520
在他找到威震天之前
before he finds Megatron.

176
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,750
是 她是有点跋扈 多出来的手臂也很奇怪
Yeah, she's kinda domineering and the extra arms are weird

177
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,460
但是…我发现自己对她还蛮来电的
but... I find myself intrigued by her.

178
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,960
我还在想你什么时候会送上门来
I was wondering when you might show.

179
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,850
你还配叫科学家？
You call yourself a scientist?

180
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,070
你现在早该找到一处新的能量矿藏了！
You were supported to have located a fresh Energon source by now.

181
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,840
我道歉 威震天陛下
Apologies, Lord Megatron.

182
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,550
一个新汽车人袭击了我们 我们有些分心
We got little distracted by the new Autobot who attacked us.

183
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,010
真的？
Really?

184
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,100
那个新汽车人是谁？
And what new Autobot would that be?

185
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,090
呼呀！
HOOAAH!

186
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,030
呃 那么…
Well, the...

187
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,320
这就是你所谓的新对手？
That is your fiercesome new adversary?

188
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,920
哈哈哈哈哈 他是擎天柱的医疗兵
Hahahaha! He is Optimus Prime's mech.

189
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,990
噢 不 威震天
Oh, no, Megatron.

190
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,140
我是你的验尸官
I am your doctor of doom.

191
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,770
呼呀！
HOOAAH!

192
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,300
那好吧
Alright then.

193
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,260
为了塞博特恩！
For Cybertron!

194
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,880
啊啊 啊啊！
Ahhh, Ahhhhh!

195
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,250
救护车的确比我印象中的要生龙活虎一些
Ratchet is rather more spirited than I recollect.

196
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,420
也许是化学作用？
Chemical enhancement, perhaps?

197
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,760
给你个实验室样本 医生
There is your laboratory sample, doctor.

198
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,380
查明原因
Find out...

199
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,350
如果一种化学药剂可以把擎天柱的医官变成这样 呵呵
If a chemical can do this for Optimus Prime's lab doc, hehe

200
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,520
想想它对我们的军队所产生的影响吧
imagine what it could do for our troops.

201
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,520
噢 擎天柱 我可真傻
Oh, Optimus, I've been a fool.

202
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,790
擎天柱 有救护车的信号
Optimus, Ratchet's signal.

203
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,430
它重新出现了
It's back online.

204
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,320
大黄蜂
Bumblebee.

205
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,650
汽车人 出发
Autobots, roll out.

206
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,660
大家同为医官 我得说
Doctor, to doctor, I must say

207
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,490
感谢你对霸天虎作出的贡献
you contribution to the Decepticon cause is very much appreciated.

208
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,770
我一定会在你死后为你歌功颂德的
I'll be sure to boast of your accomplishment when you are gone.

209
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,980
在我倒数之后会发生什么呢？三 二…
Which will happen in three, two...

210
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,080
该死
Scrap.

211
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,860
哈哈哈哈 你想干什么？
Hahahahah... what are you going to do?

212
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,120
喝了它？
Drink it?

213
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,110
不 我要毁了它
No. I'm going to destroy it.

214
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,650
你这蠢货！
You idiot!

215
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,270
威震天会要了我的脑袋！
Megatron will have my head!

216
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,660
放轻松 老朋友
Easy, old friend.

217
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,540
你失去了很多能量…
You lost a lot of Energon--

218
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,040
喜忧参半
good and bad.

219
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,540
我…我没想过要伤害任何人
I... I didn't intended to hurt anyone.

220
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,960
我只是…
I just... wanted so... badly to...

221
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,330
太想帮忙了
Help us.

222
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,710
我们知道
We know.

223
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,710
但你差点造成了无可挽回的损失…
But you nearly caused the loss of something irreplaceable--

224
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,620
我们的医官
our medic

225
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,330
还有一个值得信赖的朋友
and a most trusted friend.

226
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,590
你的确带我们找到了急需的能量供给
You did lead us to a much needed Energon supply.

227
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,310
为此
And, for that

228
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,980
大家都应该感谢你
we should all be thankful.

229
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,900
很显然 在再次测试之前 人造能量的配方需要进一步改进――
The Synthetic Energon formula clearly needs refining before it can be tested again-

230
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,670
然后通过机器测试 而不是汽车人
on machines, not Autobots.

231
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,940
好在你当场销毁了残余的样本
Let us take comfort in the fact that you

232
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,030
对此 我们值得庆幸
are able to dispose of the quantity that remained.
