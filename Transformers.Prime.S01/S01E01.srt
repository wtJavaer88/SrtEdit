1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,080
当时我正在巡逻
So there I am on the look out

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,410
突然有人用远光灯晃我的后视镜
when out of nowhere these high beams light up my rear view.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,760
然后把我拦了下来
And then they hit me.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,030
说我非法停车！
I'm illegally parked!

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,610
又领到罚单了吧？
Another parking ticket?

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,520
比那更厉害 一只靴子
Better, the boot.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,100
大大的金属轮胎夹 根本弄不掉
Big metal tyre clamp, impossible to remove.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,310
对头！
Bingo!

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,030
不过警方也是在照章办事
So the local police do their thing

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,290
我领着他们跑过整整一个街区
and I led them get all the way down the block.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,160
然后一脚踢掉了那只锃亮的靴子 “砰”的一声
That's when I kick out my new shiny shoe and "bang!"

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,800
纽约的警察太没面子了
New York's finests soil themselves.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,240
你是了解我的 阿尔茜
You know me, Arcee

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,630
想跟我飞过山作对
mess with Cliffjumper...

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,020
先看看你那对牛角！
And check at the horns.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,200
可这似乎违背了汽车人守则第一条：
Not sure how that complies with Autobot rule No.1

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,620
保持低调
keep a low profile.

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,020
怎么说呢？
What can I say?

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,550
在这鸟不拉屎的地方搜索能量实在无聊
Patrolling for energon out here in Dullsville gets alone, so.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,470
我都有点想念霸天虎了
Almost makes me miss the Decepticons.

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,040
你是来内华达州的贾斯帕玩吗？
Like Jasper Nevada has a party?

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,640
这个星球上无论身处何处 我们都是孤立的 小飞
We're alone wherever we travel on this rock, Cliff.

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,010
我收到一个信号
I'm getting a signal.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,840
需要后援吗？
Need backup?

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,950
就凭我 需要后援吗？
Do I ever need backup?

26
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,430
我刚发现了一大堆能量！
I just found a whole lotta energon!

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,580
霸天虎！
Decepticons!

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,960
阿尔茜 关于后援的问题…
Arcee, about that backup...

29
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,280
听好了 小子们
Fair warning, boys.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,000
我给你们点颜色看看
I'll put a few dints in ya.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,580
阿尔茜呼叫擎天柱
Arcee to Optimus.

32
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,790
虎子们回来了
The Cons are back.

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,520
小飞处境非常危险
Cliff might be knee deep in scrap.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,100
明白
Understood.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,720
救护车 你有飞过山的坐标吗？
Ratchet, do you have Cliffjumper's coordinate?

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,880
我已经锁定了他的信号 擎天柱
I'm locked on his signal, Optimus.

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,810
但我们的队员分散在不同的时区
But our team is scattered across time zones.

38
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,960
阿尔茜 隔板 大黄蜂
Arcee, Bulkhead, Bumblebee

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,940
在基地汇合 准备进入环陆桥
rendezvous back at base and prepare to ground bridge.

40
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,580
喜欢我的角吗？
You want the horns?

41
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,890
让你们吃个够！
You got 'em.

42
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,890
这里的能量已经没用了
The energon is worthless to me now.

43
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,620
红蜘蛛
Scream

44
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,660
久违了
it's been a while.

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,630
我说 你的主子呢？
So, where is your master?

46
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,250
少跟我提他！
Never mind him!

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,000
我就是自己的主子！
I am my own master!

48
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,190
还有问题吗？
Any more questions?

49
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,870
把它清理干净
Clean that up.

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,890
一个未开发的能量矿
An untapped energon deposit.

51
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,340
所剩无几了吧？
What's left of it?

52
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,710
三年来霸天虎的首次行动
The first Decepticon activity in three years.

53
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,250
但愿如此
That we know of.

54
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,700
如果他们真是在寻找能量
If they're scouting for energon

55
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,580
则可能是为他的回归做准备
they maybe preparing for his return.

56
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,350
不
No.

57
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,310
救护车 你能追踪到他的方位吗？
Ratchet, can you track his position?

58
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,300
不！
No!

59
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,320
飞过山的生命信号…刚刚消失了
Cliffjumper's life signal... just went offline.

60
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,810
声波 怎么了？
Soundwave, what is it?

61
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,860
“你是来内华达州的贾斯帕玩吗？”
"Like Jasper Nevada has a party?"

62
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,160
“这个星球上无论身处何处 我们都是孤立的 小飞”
"We're alone wherever we travel on this rock, Cliff."

63
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,710
还有个叫阿尔茜的…
The one called Arcee...

64
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,850
既然他们在明 我们在暗
Why slay just one Autobot

65
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,430
区区一个汽车人怎么可能让我满足呢？
when we still have the advantage of surprise?

66
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,490
飞过山牺牲了
We must not allow our anger over the loss of Cliffjumper

67
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,760
但不应让愤怒干扰我们的判断力
to impair our judgement.

68
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,350
时至今日 地球上只剩下我们五个汽车人了
As of today, only we five Autobots remain on this earth.

69
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,830
我们要铭记塞博特恩的一切回忆
We owe it to ourselves

70
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,730
不仅为了自己 为了纪念塞博特恩
to the memory of Cybertron

71
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,840
为了在各个星系寻找避难所的汽车人
to any Autobots in any galaxy seeking safe harbour

72
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,770
也为了人类
to human kind.

73
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,390
更要为我们失去的战友
And we owe it to the memory of our fallen comrade

74
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,000
而生存下去
to survive.

75
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,390
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

76
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,260
小飞走了 站在这儿哭是不会让他复生的
If Cliff's gone, standing around here soaking won't bring him back.

77
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,670
如果你们没有意见
So unless anyone minds

78
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,000
我想我还是回去保护人类吧
think I'll get back to protecting human kind.

79
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,310
擎天柱 帮助人类只会导致更多的悲剧
Optimus, helping humans will only result in more tragedy.

80
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,470
我明白你的意思
Your opinion is noted.

81
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,370
欢迎光临KO快餐厅 每个肉饼都顶呱呱
Welcome to KO drive-in, where every paddy is knockout.

82
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,760
您想要点什么？
May I take your order?

83
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,800
两份超级套餐 加量薯条
Two super combos, extra fries.

84
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,610
好 2号套餐两份 还要点什么？
Ok, those numeral twos. Anything else?

85
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,540
有 要些建议
Yeah, some advice.

86
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,880
怎么才能得到和你一样风光的工作？
How do I get an awesome job like yours?

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,880
您点的是两份“冷笑话”套餐
So that's two "we're not as funny as we think we are" combos

88
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,670
赠一碟“有种就来啊”小菜！
with the side of "bite me"!

89
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,620
你说什么？
Haha...What did you say?

90
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,590
5.59美元 先生 窗口付款
5.59$, sir, at the window.

91
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,010
我…我要赔钱的
I have to pay for that.

92
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,430
虫兄鼠弟
Twins.

93
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,010
休息一下 沙蒂
Take five, Sadie.

94
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,020
嘿 妈妈 我刚下班
Hey, mom, I just got off.

95
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,730
不 我不去舞会了
No, I'm not going to the dance.

96
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,790
经验告诉我 不能太出风头
Experience suggests I should never cut a rug.

97
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,210
除非我真会跳舞
Unless I'm stealing a carpet.

98
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,300
注意安全？
Be careful?

99
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,720
不是吧？
Seriously?

100
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,320
这儿可是贾斯帕
This is Jasper.

101
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,510
我爱死你了
I love you.

102
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,220
哦 我也爱你 妈妈 我得走了
Yeah, I love you, too, mom. I got to run.

103
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,170
你好啊 美人儿
Hello, beautiful.

104
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
怎么现在才出现？
Where've you been all my life?

105
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,950
身材真好！
Nice!

106
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,360
KO餐厅的薪水实在不高
It may take a few KO pay checks

107
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,730
但总有一天 我要买辆和你一样的座驾
but I am gonna own a ride like you some day.

108
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,500
你在对你的摩托说话吗？
Are you talking to your motorcycle?

109
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,000
对…我的摩托？
Yea, my motorcycle?

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
不 我是说
No, I mean

111
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
对 对
yes, yes

112
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,370
它…它是我的 但…
it's... it's mine. But...

113
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,200
不 我不是跟它说话…
no, I'm not talking to...

114
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,410
是在跟你说话
Well, to you, I am.

115
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,190
还好吧 塞拉？
How's things, Sierra?

116
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,360
找时间带你去兜兜风如何？
Take you for a spin sometime?

117
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,890
拜托 油嘴滑舌的家伙 该走了！
Come on, smooth operator, wrap it up!

118
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,130
你…知道我的名字？
You... know my name?

119
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,970
我们一起在大教室听讲座
We're in homeroom together.

120
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,190
我叫杰克 杰克・达比
I'm Jack, Jack Darby.

121
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,100
糟了
Scrap.

122
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,440
别放手！
Do not let go!

123
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,040
谁在说话？！
Who said that?!

124
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,070
红蜘蛛指挥官 已发现目标
Commander Starscream, target sighted

125
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,560
有一名人类少年同行
accompanied by a human youth.

126
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,260
把他们两个都干掉！
Destroy them both!

127
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,290
你…是什么？！
What... are you?

128
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,630
我不存在
I don't exist.

129
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,600
如果你嘴巴不严 我一定不会放过你
Tell anyone about me, and I will hunt you down.

130
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,680
糟了！
Scrap!

131
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,600
我根本不认识她！
I don't even know her!

132
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,170
上来！
Hop on!

133
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,960
那帮人为什么开枪打我们？
Why are those guys shooting at us?

134
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,580
没有原因 小鬼
There's no whys, kid

135
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,680
他们也不是人类
and they're no guys.

136
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,410
你的朋友吗？
Friend of yours?

137
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,590
家人
Family.

138
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,970
嗨 妈妈
Hi, mama.

139
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,220
赛车呢
Racing.

140
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,690
就在大街旁边
Right up the street.

141
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,400
好 再玩儿五分钟
K. Just five more minutes.

142
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,940
说了你也不懂
You have no idea.

143
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,940
够了 虎子们！
This ends here, Cons!

144
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,620
他们是什么？
What are they?

145
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,980
会说话的车变的机器人
Talking cars that turn into robots

146
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,600
或者机器人变的车
or the other way around.

147
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,250
这是…为…了…飞过山！
This.... is... for... Cliff!

148
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,200
没关系 真的
No problem. Really.

149
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,850
别碰他们！
Leave him alone!

150
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,920
求你了…
Please...

151
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,980
乌鸦嘴
Bad call.

152
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,020
快跑！快跑！
Come on, come on!

153
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,270
别往后看！
Don't look back!

154
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,690
我们刚才看到什么了？
What did we just see?

155
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,170
不知道 而且我也不太想知道
No idea, and I'm not sure I wanna find out.

156
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,330
谁想干一仗？
Who's ready to rumble?

157
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,420
怎么这么久？
What took you?

158
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,660
堵车
Traffic.

159
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,290
如果不是被人类分了神
And the Cons would have been scrap-metal

160
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,890
那对虎子早就成废铁了
if I hadn't been distracted by the humen.

161
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,300
人类？
Humen?

162
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,250
两个男孩？
Two boys?

163
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,360
第二个可能是无意间看到我们变形的
I guess the second one caught us in action.

164
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,620
我也不知道 当时挺忙的
I don't know, was a little busy at the time.

165
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,420
如果霸天虎想针对我们
If the Decepticons are targeting us

166
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,610
任何被视为与我们同盟的人 都会有生命危险
anyone perceived as our ally will be at grave risk.

167
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,180
拉夫 嘿
Raf, hey.

168
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,840
这样吧
Look, let's just...

169
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,760
我们对外守口如瓶 就当没这回事儿 好吗？
keep it between us and forget anything ever happened, ok?

170
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,550
杰克！
Jack!

171
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,890
噢 又来了！
Oh, not again!

172
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
它…想让我们上车
It... wants us to get in.

173
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,020
不 就我一个
No, just me.

174
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,350
你怎知道的？
How do you know that?

175
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,460
它就是这么说的
It said so.

176
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,550
什么？！
What?

177
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,010
你的在那边
Yours is over there.

178
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,900
可…我真的不认为…
Look, I really don't think that...

179
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,720
还好吗？
How's it going?

180
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,600
拉夫？
Raf?

181
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,830
等等！停车！
Wait, stop!

182
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,250
有史以来…最酷的…摩托
Coolest... bike... ever.

183
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,840
寄宿监护人？
Host parents?

184
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,200
无视
Ignore.

185
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,200
放松 我只想跟你谈谈
Relax. I just wanna talk to you.

186
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,750
你和你的新朋友一起谈吗？
Don't you mean you and your new friend?

187
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,700
小鬼 有很多东西你不明白
Kid, there's a lot you don't understand.

188
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,290
不 我…我明白 我明白
No, I... I get it, I get it.

189
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,790
机器人搏击俱乐部的第一条规则就是
The first rule of robot fight club is

190
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,460
不要谈论机器人搏击俱乐部
you don't talk about robot fight club.

191
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,350
你要搞清楚的是
What YOU need to understand is

192
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,310
我不想有一堆会说话的疯车跟着我
that I don't want a bunch of crazy talking vehicles

193
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,630
害我被人追杀
following me around, trying to get me killed.

194
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,470
这样 你叫杰克 是吧？
Look, Jack, is it?

195
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,020
擎天柱要见你\N正是为了你的人身安全考虑
Your personal safety is exactly why Optimus Prime has requested your presence.

196
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,410
擎天啥？
Wait, eh... Optimus who?

197
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,400
你可能有危险
You maybe in danger

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,050
因为你是仅有的几个看到我们的人之一
because you are one of the few, one of the only who have ever seen us.

199
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,030
哥们儿 你还等什么？
Dude, what are you waiting for?

200
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,910
去嘛！
Go with!

201
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,410
糟了
Scrap.

202
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,160
我们干嘛连她也带上？
And why exactly are we taking her?

203
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,660
有规定
Rules.

204
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,640
嘿 什么…哇！
Hey, what... whoa!

205
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
酷！
Cool...

206
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,280
不是只有两个吗
I thought there were two.

207
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,660
你不知道吗？
Haven't you heard?

208
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,320
人类可以繁殖
Humans multiply.

209
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,650
我叫拉夫
I'm Raf.

210
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,970
我叫神子
I'm Miko.

211
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,300
你叫什么？
Who are you?

212
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,490
隔板
Bulkhead.

213
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,370
你是一辆车？
Are you a car?

214
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,160
我敢说你是卡车 是大脚车！
I bet you're a truck. A monster truck!

215
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,340
你喜欢重金属音乐吗？你多重？
Do you like heavy metal? How much do you weigh?

216
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,760
用破碎锤打过沙包吗？
Ever use a wrecking ball for a punching bag?

217
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,580
如果你们是机器人
So, if you guys are robots

218
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,300
是谁造出你们的？
who made you?

219
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,260
真要命…
Please...

220
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,080
我们是来自塞博特恩星球的自主机械生命体
We are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.

221
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,060
也可以叫我们“汽车人”
Also known as Autobots.

222
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,530
你们为什么来地球？
Why are you here?

223
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,840
保护你们的星球免受霸天虎的侵害
To protect your planet from the Decepticons.

224
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
就是昨晚那些想谋杀我们的喽
The jokers who tried to bump us off last night.

225
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,770
好吧…
Okay...

226
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,410
那他们为什么来地球？
Why are they here?

227
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
问得好 杰克
A fair question, Jack.

228
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,870
部分原因是\N我们的星球经过千百年的内战
In part, they are here because our planet is uninhabitable

229
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,860
已经不再适合居住
ravaged by centuries of civil war.

230
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,390
你们干嘛要打仗？
Why were you fighting a war?

231
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,110
原因有很多
Foremost

232
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,450
核心问题 是为了我们的世界对于能量的控制权
over control of our world supply of energon

233
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,610
也就是汽车人以及霸天虎的生命能量
the fuel and life blood of all Autobots and Decepticons alike.

234
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,530
战斗非常激烈
The combat was fierce

235
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,070
持续了数个世纪
and endured for centuries.

236
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,060
起初 我和一个可与之称兄道弟的人并肩作战
In the beginning, I fought along side one whom I considered a brother.

237
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,220
但是 战争可以将理想腐化
But in war, ideals can be corrupted.

238
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,340
正是这种腐化
And it was thus

239
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,270
使威震天误入了歧途
that Megatron lost his way.

240
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,610
这是历史考试题吗？
Is there gonna be a quiz?

241
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,050
那个威震天…
So what does Megatron

242
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,580
还有这些事情
or any of this

243
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,060
跟我们有什么关系？
have to do with us?

244
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,730
很久没有关于威震天的任何消息了
Megatron has not been seen or heard from in some time.

245
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,300
但如果他即将东山再起
But if his return is imminent

246
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,520
我恐怕 又要掀起一场腥风血雨
as I fear, it could be catastrophic.

247
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,140
那些信号是从太空深处传来的
Those transmissions are emanating from deep space.

248
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,110
我可不想浪费能量
I would hate to waste the energon

249
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,200
除非你对此十分肯定
unless you're absolutely certain.

250
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,050
那么就锁定信号坐标
Then lock on transmission coordinates

251
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,620
启动太空桥
and activate the space bridge.

252
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,970
霸天虎们！
Decepticons!

253
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,310
我回来了！
I have returned!
