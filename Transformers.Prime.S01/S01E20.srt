1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,910
我真傻 真的
I have been a fool.

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,410
我犯过错误 大错特错
Made mistakes. Monumental ones.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,410
现在我明白了 我永远都不会成为一名领袖
I now realize that I was never destined to be  a leader

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,220
更不用说和他平起平坐
or even an equal partner.

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,340
不过 我现在已经尘埃落定
And, I'm at peace with that.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,310
我已经认清了自己在宇宙中的位置
I have gained a clear understanding of my place in this universe

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,610
认清了自我 那个自始至终的我
of who I am, of who I was always meant to be.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,420
红蜘蛛 副指挥官
Starscream, second-in-command

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,710
威震天陛下的心腹侍从
humble servant to Lord Megatron.

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,900
谢谢你的聆听 声波
Thank you for listening, Soundwave.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,370
这是真的吗？
Is this true?

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,500
红蜘蛛从没说起过吗？
Starscream never mentioned it?

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,610
如果他又想故技重施
If he's up to his old tricks

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,490
我一定把他捏成碎屑
I shall grind him into powder.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,570
红蜘蛛？
Starscream?

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,560
威震天陛下 请原谅毒蜘蛛的无礼取闹
Lord Megatron, please excuse Airachnid's impertinence.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,880
好了 我忘了告诉您什么鬼东西吗？
Now, what was it that I allegedly failed to mention?

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,640
先驱号
The Harbinger.

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,920
怎么了?
What about it?

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,820
许多年前 一艘霸天虎运输船在这个星球坠毁
Eons ago a Decepticon transport crash-landed on this planet.

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,410
噢 拜托 这谁都知道
Oh, please, common knowledge.

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,620
刚到地球时 我就去查看了坠机地点
I scouted the crash site when we first arrived on Earth.

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,090
那么我猜 你一定已经收回了 先驱号运载的武器原型吧？
Then I presume you recovered the experimental weapon prototype the Harbinger had been transporting?

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,260
坠机地点在哪儿？
Where is the crash site?

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,340
地点并没有录入飞船的数据库
It was never logged into your ship's database.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,650
你没有记录霸天虎运输船的坐标？
You failed to record the coordinates of a Decepticon transport?

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,400
是我疏忽 主人
An oversight, master.

28
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,720
但确切位置就在我脑子里
But I noted its exact location.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,780
那你就带毒蜘蛛过去
Then you can lead Airachnid there.

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,970
让她把那件武器原型给我带回来
So that she may retrieve the prototype for me.

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,780
我有私人本地导游了
My personal native guide.

32
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,820
真高兴
How delightful.

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
嘿 搭档
Hey, partner

34
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,950
你这里风景不错嘛
heck of a view you got up here.

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,930
但愿你的火种还能听到我说话 其实…
If there's even a small chance your spark is out there listening, well...

36
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,500
我们真的需要你 小飞
we could really use you, Cliff.

37
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,790
最近几乎每天都有新的霸天虎冒出来
Seems like every day another Decepticon arrives on the scene.

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,560
我们人手不够 火力不足
We are outnumbered and outgunned.

39
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,940
算了 我知道你会说
Yea, I know what you'd say.

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,720
“看来要好好打一仗了”
'Sounds like a fair fight.'

41
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,290
如果我们注定生活在这样的世界 那无所谓
And if that's the world we live in, so be it.

42
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,820
我只想让你知道
I just want you to know:

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,180
我没有放弃
I haven't given up.

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,260
我要把杀死你的虎子揪出来
I'm going to find the Con who took you from us.

45
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,690
你的机械形态缺乏冲刺的快感
Your chosen vehicle mode lacks thrust.

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,040
你是来领路的 还是来显摆的？
Are you going to preen or are you going to guide?

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,530
我会告诉你先驱号的准确位置
I will reveal the exact location of the Harbinger

48
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,840
可你得说清楚 我们在找什么
when you tell me exactly what we are looking for.

49
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,850
到时候自然真相大白
That information is need-to-know.

50
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,810
现在嘛 你不必知道
And right now, you don't.

51
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,030
噢 你最好放尊重一点 毒蜘蛛
Oh, You would do well to respect me, Airachnid.

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
在投靠威震天之前
Before I joined Megatron

53
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,250
我可是能量追踪者中队的空军指挥官
I was Air Commander of a squadron of Energon Seekers.

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,590
那是在塞博特恩 离现在有些年头了吧？
On Cybertron, and how many eons ago was that?

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,930
就在最近
Just recently

56
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,170
我一个人干掉了擎天柱的得力干将之一 飞过山
I personally vanquished one of Optimus Prime's fiercest warriors--Cliff Jumper.

57
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,880
你干掉了一个汽车人？
You snuffed an Autobot?

58
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,150
是的 没错 丝毫没有手软
Yes I did. Without mercy.

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,960
噢 威震天本想在矿井里把你干掉 可他也一时心软
Oh, even Megatron showed you mercy when he planned to terminate you at the mine.

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,320
什么？他连这都告诉你了？
What? He told you about that?

61
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,370
聊天而已
We talk.

62
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,630
飞船残骸就在我们所在位置的正下方
The wreckage lies just beneath where we stand.

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,260
我得去找个入口
I will need to find a point of entry.

64
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,210
真能显摆
Show off.

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,830
随便你吧 多年前我就已经把这里翻遍了
Suit yourself, I conducted a thorough search of this husk years ago.

66
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,820
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

67
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,950
访问货物清单
Accessing the cargo manifest

68
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,590
你在翻遍这里的时候 没想过这么做吗？
or didn't you think to do that during your thorough search?

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,810
笨蛋 飞船的系统几个世纪以来都没有激活
Idiot. The ship's systems haven't been activated for eons.

70
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,960
汽车人会探测到它的能量特征
The Autobots could detect its energy signature.

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,570
啊 找到了 在23区
Ah, here it is. Section 23.

72
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,360
擎天柱 我们侦测到一个霸天虎的能量特征
Optimus, our scanners have detected a Decepticon energy profile

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,710
但是种…古老的信号
but it's... ancient.

74
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,770
历史总是可以和当代接轨 救护车
The past has a way of catching up with the present, Ratchet.

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,300
23区应该就在…这儿
Section 23 should be right about... here.

76
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,150
飞船到头了
The ship just ends.

77
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,890
它一定是在坠落时断成了两截
It must have broken in half during the crash.

78
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,040
也许在空中已经断了
Or in the air.

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,490
如果你真的做过研究
If you performed actual research

80
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,570
不会不知道 先驱号是被汽车人部队从天上打下来的
You would have learned that an Autobot battalion shot the Harbinger out of the sky.

81
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,520
另一半飞船离这儿多远？
How far away is the other half?

82
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,580
应该说 到时候自然真相大白
I'm afraid that information is needed-to-know.

83
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,450
你要…
What are you...

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,370
你想让我在威震天面前出丑吗？
You're trying to make me look like a fool before Megatron.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,710
让我空手而归 而你去独吞那个武器
Have me return empty handed while you locate that weapon yourself.

86
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,110
你竟敢指责我！
How dare you acuse me!

87
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,230
你不过是个食腐动物 喜欢投机取巧！
You are nothing but a scavenger, an opportunist.

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,520
你不也是这种人吗？
Aren't you one to talk?

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,540
也许吧 但我已经洗心革面了
Perhaps, but I've changed

90
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,150
从前我曾经走错过路
seeing the error of my ways.

91
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,410
但我现在活着的目的 就为威震天效劳
I live to serve Megatron now.

92
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,440
你休想活命 除非你告诉我另一半飞船在哪儿 快说！
You won't live to serve anyone if you don't tell me where to find the rest of the ship, now.

93
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,660
向北走几公里 穿过一道石拱门
A few kliks north of here through a stone arch.

94
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,940
快把我放开！
Now release me!

95
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,670
我拿到武器后 就放了你
When I have the weapon in hand.

96
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,230
不过 但愿在没人带路的情况下 我能找回来
That is, if I can find my way back without my guide.

97
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,150
这可不好玩儿 毒蜘蛛
This is not funny, Airachnid

98
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,580
马上回来给我松绑
come back here right now and cut me lose.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,530
毒蜘蛛 这是命令！
Airachnid, that is an order!

100
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,700
我是你的指挥官！
I am your commanding officer!

101
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,860
毒蜘蛛
Airachnid.

102
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,280
投降吧
Surrender.

103
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,830
毒蜘蛛 你这个叛徒！
Airachnid, you traitor!

104
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,410
阿尔茜 等等！
Arcee, wait!

105
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,550
阿尔茜
Arcee.

106
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,200
我没想到 你会重新投奔霸天虎
I didn't peg you for resigning with the Decepticons.

107
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,930
缓兵之计罢了 阿尔茜
A temporary arrangement, Arcee.

108
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,150
你知道 我更喜欢单干
You know I prefer working alone.

109
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,420
话说 想在成长日志里 再加上几个阵亡战友的名字吗？
Speaking of add anymore deceased partners to your growing list?

110
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,820
毒蜘蛛 放开她
Airachnid, release her.

111
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,860
阿尔茜 你应该知道 不能独自和敌人交战
Arcee, you know better than to engage the enemy alone.

112
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,390
她是例外 她把挡板害惨了
Not her. Not after what she did to Tailgate.

113
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,750
不 求你了 挡板！
No, please. Tailgate!

114
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,610
她必须付出代价
She will pay.

115
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,730
复仇并不能让牺牲的战士回来
Revenge will not bring back those we have lost.

116
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,320
明白吗？
Is that understood?

117
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,170
快走
Move it.

118
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,310
用不着动粗吧
No need to use force.

119
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,220
你们想知道什么 我全说
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

120
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,400
呵呵 真的吗？
Hehe, is that right?

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,350
你想要什么回报？
And what you want in return?

122
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,550
我想要…加入你们
I want to be on your side.

123
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,230
加入我们？哈哈 你要是能当汽车人
On our side? Haha, yeah, right.

124
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,520
我还能跟堕落金刚玩抛球呢！
And I've been lobbing with the Fallen!

125
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,840
你不会背叛霸天虎的
You wouldn't betray the Decepticons.

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,800
为什么不会？
Wouldn't I?

127
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,630
他们最近都是怎么待我的
What have they done for me lately

128
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,930
除了羞辱我
besides humiliate me

129
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,130
监视我 还降我的级
spy on me, demote me?

130
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,800
威震天不念旧情 想把我干掉
Megatron tried to extinguish my spark in cold blood

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,300
还有那个一心想取代我的混蛋毒蜘蛛
then all but to replace me with that treacherous wretch Airachnid.

132
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,140
她竟然丢下我不管！
She abandoned me!

133
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,040
让我自生自灭！
Left me for scrap!

134
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,840
所以 干嘛不过河拆桥呢？
So why not rat them out?

135
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,630
他说的是实话 威震天的确想杀了他
He is telling the truth about Megatron trying to scrap him.

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,660
是我亲眼看见的
I saw with my own eyes.

137
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,680
你不是想说 你相信红蜘蛛吧？
You're not saying you actually trust Starscream?

138
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,040
相信他？绝不会
Trust him? Never.

139
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,640
但这次我们也许能联手对敌
But this may be the one time our objective's alined.

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,910
你的担心很有道理 隔板
You're right to be wary, Bulkhead.

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,210
但我赞成阿尔茜
But I agree with Arcee.

142
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,100
我简直按捺不住火种的狂跳
Be still, my beating spark.

143
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,870
你猜怎么着
What do you know.

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,490
可能又是个陷阱
Could still be a trap.

145
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,250
红蜘蛛在威震天面前一直三心二意
Starscream's loyalty to Megatron has always been questionable.

146
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,510
如果他真的和霸天虎决裂
If he has truly split from the Decepticons

147
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,120
这个了解军情的俘虏 也许是个值得结交的盟友
our prisoner's knowledge of their agendas could make him a valuable ally.

148
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,940
你不是认真的吧？
You don't mean permanently?

149
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,180
难道要把基地的钥匙也交给他吗？
As in key to the base and everything?

150
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,550
尽管有些不切实际
However unlikely that scenario

151
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,870
但每个生命体都应该得到赎罪的机会
every sentient being deserves an opportunity for redemption.

152
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,940
即使他是汽车人杀手吗？那毒蜘蛛呢？
Even Bot-killers? Even Airachnid?

153
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,890
如果不抱这个希望 我们可能永远得不到长治久安
Without that hope, we may never achieve lasting peace.

154
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,630
太阳晒屁股了 蜘蛛侠
Rise and shine, Screamy.

155
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,730
我们到了 飞船在哪里？
We are here. Where is the ship?

156
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,500
穿过石拱门 在石堆中间
It's through the arch, among the stones.

157
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,360
隔板 大黄蜂 跟我来
Bulkhead, Bumblebee, you are with me.

158
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,060
阿尔茜 留下看管战俘
Arcee, remain with our prisoner.

159
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,700
擎天柱 求你了
Optimus, please.

160
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,410
为了挡板
For Tailgate.

161
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,890
你渴望为挡板复仇 只会一再影响你的判断力
Your desire to avenge Tailgate will only continue to cloud your judgement.

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,760
真的有必要用手铐吗？
Is the clamp really necessary?

163
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
我保证不飞走
I promise not to fly away.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,180
我都要抽筋了
It's really giving me a crick.

165
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,640
我把你扔回车箱里如何
I can shove you back in the trailer.

166
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,810
保持警惕
Be alert.

167
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,420
毒蜘蛛善于从地下攻击
Airachnid is known to attack from below ground.

168
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,040
明白
Right.

169
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,510
让我来
I got it.

170
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,120
静止器 果然名不虚传
The Immobilizer. True to its name.

171
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,060
我并没有那么坏 你知道
I'm not really so bad, you know.

172
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,320
威震天才是十恶不赦的坏人
Megatron, he is the evil one.

173
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,090
跟那些想听的人说去吧
Tell it to someone who cares.

174
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,950
跟谁说？毒蜘蛛？
Like whom? Airachnid?

175
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,650
我无时无刻不想掐住她该死的脖子
What I wouldn't do to get my hands around her wretched throat.

176
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,460
这一点 我们倒可以达成一致
So we can agree on one thing.

177
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,970
噢 你根本想不到
Oh, you have no idea.

178
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,570
她莫名其妙地出现
She showed up one day

179
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,010
然后呢 她就像个大管家一样
and the next thing you know, she is acting like she runs the place.

180
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,440
她对威震天吹枕边风
She whispered lies into Megatron's ear

181
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,270
而且还坐上了本座的交椅！
maneuvered to rob me of my rightful place.

182
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,530
是啊 她还杀了我的搭档
Well, she terminated my partner.

183
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,350
什么？！她把杀掉他的功劳安在自己头上？！
What?! She is taking credit for scrapping him now, too?!

184
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,910
那是我干的！
That was my doing!

185
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,070
什么？
What?

186
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,110
你当时不在场
You weren't there.

187
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,930
啊 我当然不在
Ah, of course I wasn't.

188
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,870
我不知道刚才在想什么
I don't know what I was thinking.

189
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,250
你说的是谁？
Who are you talking about?

190
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,500
谁也没说 你说的是谁？
No one, who are you talking about?

191
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,640
挡板
Tailgate.

192
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,770
谁是挡板？
Who's Tailgate?

193
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,710
原来是你
You were the one.

194
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,970
是你杀了飞过山
You extinguished Cliffjumper.

195
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,440
飞过山？
Cliffjumper?

196
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,360
不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

197
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,880
你搞错了
You misunderstand.

198
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,740
不是你想的那样
It wasn't like you think.

199
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,990
机械兵打得他半死不活
The Troopers mortally wounded him.

200
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,260
我是想帮助飞过山…
I was trying to help Cliffjumper...

201
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,850
帮他结束痛苦
put him out of his misery.

202
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,350
是他求我的！
He begged me to!

203
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,770
好吧 好吧！这是个失误！
OK, OK! it was a mistake!

204
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,460
我曾经犯过错误 但我已经改了！
I've made many, but I've changed!

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,170
你不会杀害一个手无寸铁的俘虏 对吧？
You wouldn't terminate a defenceless prisoner, would you?

206
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,100
什么…那是什么？
What... what is that?

207
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,670
你手铐的钥匙
The key to your cuffs.

208
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,000
为什么？
What for?

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
换成小飞 他会给你一个决斗的机会
Cliff would have given you a fighting chance.

210
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,700
不 求你 我不想决斗！
No. Please, I... I don't want to!

211
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,210
过去的都过去了
What's past is past.

212
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,960
现在我是你们的一员！
I'm one of you now!

213
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,110
不 不 不…
No, no, no, no...

214
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,970
把它捡起来！
Take it!

215
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,170
胆小鬼
You're pathetic.

216
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,750
有问题吗 阿尔茜？
Something wrong, Arcee?

217
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,900
我还以为你想决斗呢
I thought you wanted a fight.

218
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,170
不许动
Freeze.

219
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,590
你比你的前搭档棘手一点
You are tougher to scrap than your former partner

220
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,080
至少比我杀掉的那个强
at least the one I scrapped.

221
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,280
挡板也像飞过山一样不堪一击吗？
Was Tailgate weak like Cliffjumper?

222
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,260
有种就接着说 红蜘蛛
Just keep talking, Starscream.

223
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,640
告诉我 虫子
Tell me, bug.

224
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,130
你认为 威震天会喜欢他的新战利品吗？
Do you think Megatron will enjoy his new trophies?

225
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,980
他也许会用这个大块头来当靶子
He'll probably use the bulky one here for target practice.

226
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,930
擎天柱啊 真是物有所值
Prime is the true prize.

227
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,640
也许可以用他来装饰威震天战舰的船首
Perhaps he'll adorn the prow of Megatron's warship.

228
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,870
至于你 虫子
But you, bug.

229
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,090
我怀疑 威震天只会把你当废铁拆掉
I suspect Meagtron will simply dismantle you for spare parts.

230
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,420
作为一个游侠 一只食腐动物
As a rogue, a scavenger

231
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,300
我应该带着这个宝贝消失在夜色里
I should disappear into the night with this treasure.

232
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,570
但是 用它来取悦威震天 是个不容错过的大好机会
But using it to warm my way into Megatron's favor is too good an opportunity to pass up.

233
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,000
你说是不是 擎天柱？
Wouldn't you say, Prime?

234
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,640
有了这样的战绩
I mean with results like this.

235
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,950
我可以成为威震天的心腹
I could earn Megatron's eternal trust.

236
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,990
你这个白痴！
You fool!

237
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,050
你应该趁我不能还手的时候杀了我
You should have finished me when I was hopeless to fight.

238
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,960
就像我杀死飞过山一样
Just like I finished Cliffjumper.

239
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,640
现在 准备和你的那些搭档团聚吧
Now, prepare to reunite with your partners.

240
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,580
说什么？我听不见你的遗言
What's that? I can't hear your last words.

241
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,260
这…是…为了…飞过山！
This is for Cliffjumper!

242
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,320
来吧 动手吧！
Go on. Do it!

243
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,910
如果回到霸天虎那里 威震天只会当我谋反 把我杀掉
Megatron will only terminate me for treason if I dare return to the Decepticons.

244
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,300
你可以成为那个 帮我结束痛苦的人
You may as well be the one to put me out of my misery.

245
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,990
你以为我需要怂恿吗？
As if I needed convincing.

246
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,890
什么？等等！不！
What? Wait! No!

247
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,500
你让红蜘蛛落在汽车人手里？！
You left Starscream with the Autobots?!

248
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,430
你知不知道 你的愚蠢失误会带来什么后果？！
Do you have any notion of the consequences of your blunder?!

249
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,350
但是 阁下！
But, my lordship!

250
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,830
丢掉了静止器 全怪红蜘蛛无能！
It was Starscream's incompetence that cost us the Immobilizer!

251
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,460
我才不在乎那个小玩意儿！
I don't care about some trinket!

252
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,020
我的副官成了敌人的阶下囚！
My second-in-command is a prisoner of the enemy!

253
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:05,200
这就是说 霸天虎的所有情报 可能已经落入了汽车人的手里！
Which means all Decepticon intelligence could be at the fingertips of the Autobots!

254
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,730
破损情况很严重
The damage look bad

255
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,600
但很容易就修好了
but it was a snap to repair

256
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,110
可以把对你们的效用逆转
allowing us to reverse its effect on you.

257
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,950
你们应该很快就能行动自如了
You should regain your full range of motion before long.

258
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,420
那阿尔茜呢？
And Arcee?

259
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,020
作为一辆两轮车 她恢复得够快了
She is rather resilient for a two-wheeler.

260
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,490
痊愈的只是那些皮外伤
It is the external wounds which heal the quickest.

261
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,640
我以为 拼命杀敌会让我忘掉过去
I thought settling scores would allow me to move on...

262
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,530
但是 我却把早日结束战争的希望赶跑了
Instead, I chased away our hope of winning this war anytime soon.

263
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,320
智慧并不是天生的 阿尔茜
Wisdom cannot be granted, Arcee.

264
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,480
必须靠拼搏得来 有时要付出代价
It must be earned, sometimes at a cost.

265
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,160
我真傻 真的
I have been a fool.

266
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,230
我犯过错误
Made mistakes.

267
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,730
大错特错
Monumental ones.

268
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,120
但是 我已经认清了自己在宇宙中的位置
But I have gained a clear understanding of my place in this universe.

269
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,230
认清了自我
Of who I am.

270
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,730
红蜘蛛
Starscream: aligned with no side

271
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,320
不效忠任何人
servant, to no one.
