1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,160
根据原始天尊圣约记载
And it was written in the Covenant of Primus

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,340
“当四十七颗星球连成一线之际
that "when the 47 spheres align

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,700
无尽的纷争 终将席卷某个混沌的世间
a perpetual conflict will culminate upon a world forged from chaos

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,060
弱者随之消亡 黑暗势力崛起并笼罩四方”
and the weak shall perish in the shadow of a rising darkness."

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,120
天上还会下火球吗？
No, sky is raining fire?

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,470
不用多说
Goes without say

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,760
这的确是个可怕的末世论
it is a doom prophecy after all.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,910
要我说 这纯粹是无稽之谈
I say it's a load of hooey.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,940
我一直以为 古人所说的是我们的母星
I'd always assume the ancients were referring to our home planet

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,530
但既然塞博特恩早在千万年前就陷入黑暗…
but being that Cybertron has been dark for eons...

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,780
而且 威震天到来之后 这个星球变得多灾多难…
And considering what has befallen this planet since Megatron's arrival here...

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,030
哇…
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,000
这些神论我们能倒背如流 可从没当回事儿
We've known about these superstitions for ages and never gave them a second thought.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,870
现在干嘛这么疑神疑鬼的？
Why all the ominous rumblings now?

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,710
因为预言中提到的星球串联现象 近在眼前
Because the planetary alignment to which the prophecy refers is nearly upon us.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,810
而且看起来它的末端…是地球
And it would seem its end point... is Earth.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
呃…巧合得太离谱了 是吧？
Eh... Crazy coincidence, yeah, right?

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,860
还有多久？
How long are we talking?

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,480
最多不过几天时间
A few days, at most.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,350
这个事实固然令人不安
However unsettling this revelation may be

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,050
但我更担心另一些人 他们很可能利用预言图谋不轨
I am more concerned about those who might believe that the prophecy speaks to them alone.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,700
我一心寻找宇宙大帝之血 不是为了苟且偷生
I did not seek out the blood of Unicron to simply keep my spark aflame

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,490
而是要统领不死大军 征服所有世界！
but to rule undead armies, and conquer worlds!

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,870
要想达成夙愿
And to accomplish that

25
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,400
只靠我体内这一小块碎片 是远远不够的
I require more than this mere sliver which lies within me.

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,550
那么…我的黑暗能量在哪儿？！
So... where is my Dark Energon?!

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
就在星云之间 威震天陛下
Out there, Lord Megatron.

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,000
早晚都是您的囊中之物！
Just waiting for you to reach out and pluck it!

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,070
但您不必如此勉强自己
But you shouldn't push yourself so hard.

30
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,280
您大病初愈
You've had setbacks.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,770
刚从平衡状态苏醒
You were in stasis.

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,910
正因为这样 我才必须抓紧时间！
Precisely why I must make up for lost time!

33
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,570
我眼中的未来…无比清晰！
I can see the future, vividly!

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,340
可我必须确保它成为现实
But I must ensure its outcome.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,480
因为我就是那个崛起的黑暗势力
For I am the rising darkness

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,130
预言必将由我来印证！
of which the prophecy speaks!

37
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,520
跳过 嗯… 小孩捣鬼 气球而已
Pass, um, kid in costume, balloon

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,540
不对 等等
nope, hold

39
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,940
小蜂果然很上镜
the camera sure loves Bee.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,920
有什么办法？
What can you do?

41
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,200
一旦当上超级巨星
When you're a superstar

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,610
就成了狗仔队的靶子
You're paparazzi bait.

43
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,550
等一下 那是大黄蜂吗？
Wait. Is that Bumblebee?

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,410
这是个揭秘网站
On a conspiracy website.

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,100
用户可以发布接触外星人的证据
Where users post evidents of close encounters

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,050
不过包在我们身上 救护车
but we have it under control, Ratchet.

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,880
我们把小蜂的照片抹掉 换成…\N“我是火星猫 带我去吃饭吧！”
We just scrub and replace Bee with... Mars Cat says, "Take me to your feeder!"

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,630
救护车居然笑了？
Ratchet actually laughed?

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,640
嗯 擎天柱 想看点有趣的吗？
Um, Optimus, you wanna see something funny?

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,740
不想
No.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,550
别往心里去
Don't take it personally.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,030
领袖就是那个样子
Primes are built that way.

53
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,560
从没见过擎天柱笑 哭 或者有失风度
Never seen Optimus laugh, cry or lose his cool.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,980
擎天柱从来不会轻易表露他的情感
While Optimus certainly keeps his emotions in check

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,940
但我比你们中任何一个都更熟悉他
I've known him far longer than any of you have.

56
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,670
成为领袖之前 他不是这样的
And he was different before he was made a Prime.

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,050
擎天柱没有一直当领袖吗？
Optimus wasn't always a Prime?

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,950
在塞博特恩 伟人并不是天生的
On Cybertron one isn't born into greatness

59
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,940
而是靠努力争取来的
rather, one must earn it.

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,860
那么 怎么个不同法？
So, different, how?

61
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,900
他以前是派对狂人吗？
We're talking party animal?

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,130
不 不 从前的擎天柱更像是…杰克
No, no, Optimus was more like... Jack.

63
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,460
什么？我一点也不像擎…
What? I'm nothing like Op...

64
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,590
擎天柱 还记得我们追踪的那些家伙吗
Prime, Those tech-guys my department's been tracking.

65
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,790
我们原以为是机械党 因为作案手段非常相似
We figured it was MECH on account of the stealth tactics.

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,330
可是不久前
Until moments ago when a security feed at the Pennington-Ebbs Particle Collider captured this.

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
声波
Soundwave.

68
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,280
拉夫可以帮你把声波换成小猫咪
Raf can swap that out for you with a funny cat.

69
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,380
这个“没脸”的虎子 偷走了最先进的相位导体
The Con without a face made off with the cutting-edge phase conductor.

70
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,700
这里有一份清单 列出了目前为止确认被盗的所有物品
Here is a punch list of everything else we've confirmed stolen to date.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,750
等离子喷射器 中子盾 超正方体
Plasma injector, Neutron Shield, Tesseract.

72
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,450
还差一样东西 他们就能建造…
There is only one thing missing if they are intending to build...

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,590
霸天虎太空桥2.0版 即将竣工启动
The Decepticon space bridge 2.0 is nearly ready to launch.

74
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,460
我们只差一个…
All we require is...

75
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,720
如声波所说…
what Soundwave said--

76
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,150
充足的动力源
an ample power source.

77
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,890
这东西所在的基地有重兵把守…
This one lies within a highly fortefied location...

78
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,670
不过是区区人类而已
by human standards.

79
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,220
我可以打通一条隧道
I could tunnel in.

80
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,170
预言成真的时刻就快到了！
The time of prophecy is nearly upon us.

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,380
没时间去偷鸡摸狗了
We could no longer afford stealth.

82
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,040
擎天柱 虎子们这次真的坐不住了
Prime, the Cons really stepped out at this time.

83
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,170
他们袭击了一个美军实验室
They hit a U.S. military lab

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,960
弟兄们会尽力顶住 等待你们到场
Our boys in green will fend them off till your team shows.

85
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,770
福勒探员 我担心 威震天已经到了破釜沉舟的地步
Agent Fowler, I fear that Megatron's desperation may be at its zenith.

86
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,160
你很清楚 我绝不容许任何一名人类惨遭不测
And you know that I cannot condone even a single human casualty.

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,560
我是福勒
Fowler here.

88
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,620
疏散所有人员 立即执行
Evacuate all personnel, immediately.

89
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,780
撤退！
Retreat.

90
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,760
威震天陛下 货已到手
Lord Megatron, package secured

91
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,360
但是汽车人来了
but the Autobots have arrived.

92
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,240
啊！将战舰开往会合地点
Ah! Prepare the warship for rendezvous.

93
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,250
务必当场收货
The package will be ready for pick-up.

94
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,800
大黄蜂 他们可能需要支援
Bumblebee, the team may require back-up.

95
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,450
距离你当前位置三分钟路程 就在高速路上
They are three kliks north from your current position just on the high way.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,240
你可以在出口让拉夫下车
If you drop Raf at the exit ramp

97
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,390
我从那儿把他传送回基地
I can bridge him back to base from there.

98
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,660
没关系 小蜂
It's OK, Bee.

99
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,440
我们可以改天再赛车
We'll go racing another time.

100
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,840
哎呀呀
Well, well.

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,700
一个愚蠢的侦察兵掉队了
A foolish scout is stray from the ranks.

102
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,470
擎天柱
Optimus.

103
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,650
威震天
Megatron.

104
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,970
你知不知道 强行把预言变为现实 是种愚蠢的行为？
Do you not see the folly in trying to force a prophecy to fruition?

105
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,310
干嘛要听天由命呢
Why leave matters to fate

106
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,560
我的命运我做主 难道不好吗？
if one can forge one's own destiny?

107
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,660
啊 说到命运…
Ah, speaking of fate...

108
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,140
拉夫！
Raf!

109
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,790
他还在呼吸 但很微弱
He is breathing, barely.

110
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:39,270
啊哈 看来我不仅拍了一只黄蜂 还捏死一只臭虫
Ah, ha, it would seem I swatted a bee and squashed a bug.

111
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,780
小蜂 别！
Bee, no!

112
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,000
救护车 快把我们传送回去！
Ratchet, bridge us back now!

113
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,840
一定是有汽车人受伤了
We must have an Autobot down.

114
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,360
阿尔茜 照顾好拉斐尔 还有大黄蜂
Arcee, attend to Rafael and Bumblebee.

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,770
拉夫？
Raf?

116
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,780
不！
No!

117
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,190
怎么回事？
What happened?

118
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,410
是威震天
Megatron.

119
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,590
快 送进我的实验室
Quickly, into my laboratory.

120
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,830
啊 拉斐尔没有反应
Ah, Rafael isn’t responding.

121
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,680
必须全面检测他的零件 呃…
We must run diagnostics of his assemblage, eh...

122
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,190
生命机能
vital status.

123
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,310
啊 我的工具
Ah, my tools.

124
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,660
全都派不上用场！
They're all wrong!

125
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,270
应该叫我妈来
We need to call my mom.

126
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,540
你妈妈虽然是个护士
Your mother may be a nurse

127
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,950
但她知道能量会对人类身体 造成什么影响吗？
but does she know anything about the effects of energon on the human body?

128
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,850
那你又对人类身体了解多少？
What? Do you know anything about the human body?

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,980
妈妈 有急事
Mom it‘s urgent.

130
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,720
弱者会消亡
The weak will perish.

131
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,110
坚强点 拉斐尔
Be strong, Rafael.

132
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,270
动力源即刻准备就绪 威震天陛下
The power source will be ready in no time, Lord Megatron.

133
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,760
我们很快就能到达建造工地了
We’re nearly at the construction site.

134
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,520
还是不够快
Nearly isn' t good enough.

135
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,090
星球即将完成串联
The spheres are aligning.

136
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,410
我不能错过时机 去…
I must not miss my moment to...

137
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,810
威震天陛下？您还好吧？
Lord Megatron? Are you alright?

138
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,650
又来了
Yet again.

139
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,840
我好像能听到宇宙大帝的思想
It is as if I can hear Unicron’s thoughts.

140
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,110
宇宙大帝？那个混沌之神？
Unicron? The Chaos Bringer?

141
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,590
听说 黑暗能量就是他的血液
They say dark energon is his blood.

142
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,080
哈 管他呢
Ha, whatever.

143
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,180
快完成太空桥
Complete the space bridge.

144
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,840
我还有件要事去办
There is something I must attend to.

145
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,750
他是不是看起来…神神叨叨的？
Does he seem to be "losing it"?

146
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,350
有那么一点…
A bit...

147
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,330
妈妈 谢…
Mom, thank...

148
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,460
拿我的包来
Grab my bag.

149
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,190
先检测出他吸收了多少能量 才能决定正确的治疗方案
Measuring the extent of the absorption should determine the proper course of treatment.

150
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,090
如果不赶快稳定这孩子的病情
If I don't get this boy stabilized now

151
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,440
他不可能活着走下手术台
he will not leave this table alive.

152
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,570
你明白吗？
Do you understand me?

153
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,010
呃…
Ah...

154
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,010
小蜂 听着
Bee, listen.

155
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,110
你以为我愿意眼睁睁看着搭档…
You think I don’t know how it feels to watch a partner...

156
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,520
受伤吗？
harmed?

157
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,740
眼下 复仇是帮不了拉夫的
Revenge won't help Raf right now.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,340
你得控制你的情绪
You need to keep your emotions in check.

159
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,000
救护车 拉斐尔怎么样了？
Ratchet, how is Rafael?

160
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,810
现在还不能断言
It is too soon to know.

161
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,220
你的医术高明
He's in good hands.

162
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,220
不是我 擎天柱
Not mine. Optimus

163
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,770
塞博特恩式的傲气让我目中无人
curse my cybertronian pride.

164
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,770
我们已经接纳人类走进我们的生活
We've accepted these human into our lives

165
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,440
但我却对他们的科学和医术…不屑一顾
yet I've bothered to learn so little about their science or medicine.

166
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,660
振作起来 老朋友
Pull yourself together, old friend

167
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,230
拉斐尔需要你
Rafael needs you.

168
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,320
我也变得越来越离不开他了
And I have grown to need him.

169
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,180
锁定我的坐标 启动环陆桥
Lock on to my coordinates and activate the ground bridge.

170
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,290
准备好了
Ready.

171
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,800
隔板 返回基地
Bulkhead, return to base.

172
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,360
我还有事情要做
There is something I must do.

173
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,950
呃 真的吗？
Eh, serious?

174
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,990
长久以来我过于一厢情愿 没有意识到 历史总在不断地重演…
I have been foolish not to see what history has proven over and over again...

175
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,990
汽车人和霸天虎永远不可能志同道合
that Autobots and Decepticons will never mend their ways.

176
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,200
如果没法通过协商解决这场 旷日持久的冲突
If there can be no diplomatic solution to this perpetual conflict

177
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,820
那么我不能再容忍黑暗势力摧毁这里
then I must not allow more darkness to fall upon this

178
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,240
以及任何一个星球
or any planet.

179
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,640
必须消灭威震天！
Megatron must be destroyed!

180
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,280
我只是来讨伐威震天一个人的
I have come for Megatron and him alone.

181
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,230
想活命的 就给我让开！
Stand down and be spared.

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,560
我见过这座喷火的高山！
The flaming mountain in my visions.

183
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,860
应该是它在召唤着我…指引着我！
As if it summoned me here... Guided me!

184
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,480
我的太空桥就该建在这里
This is where I am to position my space bridge.

185
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,900
从这个地方
The place from whence

186
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,020
我可以尽情地收集黑暗能量！
I am to harvest dark energon.

187
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,670
威震天 是我 我在你的船上
Megatron, I am here, on your ship.

188
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,800
来和我做个了断吧！
Come and face me!

189
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,340
在这个地方 我即将击败…
The place in which I am to defeat...

190
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,050
最后一位领袖！
the last of the Primes.

191
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,130
听着
Hear this

192
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,830
有哪个霸天虎胆敢动擎天柱一根汗毛
any Decepticon who lays a hand on Optimus Prime

193
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,070
我都要亲自处决他！
will answer to me.

194
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,400
声波 锁定我的坐标
Soundwave, lock onto my coordinates

195
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,810
送我的老对手来接受他的命运吧！
and lead my opponent to his destiny.

196
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,830
杰克 帮我抬拉夫上车
Jack, help me get Raf to the car

197
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,330
必须送他去急救室
he's going to the emergency room.

198
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,300
达比护士
Nurse Darby

199
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,300
人类医生不会明白 折磨他的是什么东西
your doctors won't be able to comprehend what's afflicting him--

200
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,620
他们至少要研究十几年
not without a decade of study.

201
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,360
我没时间吵架
I don't have time to argue.

202
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,260
能量炮的威力足以让一名汽车人当场身亡
The effects of an energon blast on an Autobot can be devastating enough.

203
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,880
更何况他是人类
But this is a human.

204
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,560
没有能量读数
I'm not getting any readings.

205
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,950
我怎么没想到呢？
How could I not have seen this?

206
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,580
感染拉斐尔的应该是黑暗能量才对
Rafael's been infected with dark energon.

207
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:50,530
威震天 今天你必须服法 向塞博特恩和人类低头认罪
Megatron, today you answer for your crimes against Cybertron and against humanity.

208
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,710
只有一个能活命
One shall stand.

209
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,120
另一个必须死
And one shall fall.

210
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,360
就是你 擎天柱！
You, Optimus Prime!

211
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,510
既然黑暗能量正在侵蚀拉夫体内的器官
If dark energon is devouring Raf from the inside out

212
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,000
我们必须清除它 要尽快
we must expel it, and fast

213
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,350
我知道唯一的可行办法
the only possible way I know.

214
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,230
我需要能量！
I need energon.

215
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,100
等一下 你说过 能量对人体是致命的
Wait. You said energon was devastating to humans.

216
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,150
在一般情况下的确会造成伤害
Under normal circumstances, quite.

217
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:25,170
不过我要利用入侵拉斐尔身体的黑暗能量 来中和损伤
But I'm relying upon the dark matter currently invading Rafael's body to meet it head on.

218
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,680
先人早已经预见到 你会在此败北
Your defeat here was foreseen by the ancients.

219
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,140
他们说什么来着？
What was it they wrote?

220
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,070
“弱者随之消亡”？
"The weak shall perish"?

221
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,040
尽信书 不如无书
Do not believe everything you read.

222
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,350
把他推过来 快！
I need him over here, now!

223
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,560
脉搏稳定下来了
Pulse rate is stabilizing.

224
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,350
小蜂
Bee.

225
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,860
擎天柱 我们成功了
Optimus, we did it.

226
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,320
我的命运…
My destiny...

227
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,220
不该就这么草草收场！
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

228
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,900
恰恰相反 威震天…
On the contrary, Megatron...

229
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,290
我不允许有其他的结局
I could not have allowed this to end otherwise.

230
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,830
隔板 你让擎天柱一个人去对付威震天？
Bulkhead, you let Optimus face Megatron alone?

231
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,260
我没别的选择
I didn't have a choice.

232
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,410
这可能是陷阱
It could be a trap.

233
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,090
我们得找到他的位置
We need to get a fix on his location.

234
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,020
你刚才的大话是怎么说的 擎天柱？
How was it that you put it, Optimus?

235
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,630
“我不允许有其他的结局”？
"I could not have allowed this to end otherwise?"

236
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,940
我已经锁定了擎天柱的信号
I'm locked on to Optimus' signal.

237
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,510
等一下 这怎么可能？
Wait, how is this possible?

238
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,040
什么？怎么了？
What? What is it?

239
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
必须让擎天柱离开那里 快！
We need to get Optimus out of there, now!

240
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,960
哈哈哈…哎呀呀
Haha... Well, well.

241
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,060
看来我苦苦寻找的宇宙大帝之血 不是在星云之间
It seems the blood of Unicron I've been seeking is not out there

242
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,330
而是就在…我的脚下！
but rather, right here!

243
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,810
黑暗能量…居然从地球内部喷发出来？
Dark energon... erupting from the Earth?
