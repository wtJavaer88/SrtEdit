1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,800
真是丢人现眼…
Such a shame...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,280
但我佩服你 威震天
But I applaud you, Megatron.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,920
连驾崩都这么有排场
You certainly made a grand exit.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,060
啊 声波 启动视频会议
Ah Soundwave, cue the audio visual.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,300
我想和士兵们讲两句
I wish to address the troops.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,840
霸天虎大业未竟之际 威震天却突然离世
The loss of Megatron, leader of the great Decepticon uprising

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,970
这对我们来说无疑是一个打击
is certainly a blow to our cause.

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,920
但我们绝不能因他的悲惨遭遇而感到绝望
Yet we mustn't despair over his tragic... demise.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,370
恰恰相反 我们要对他的壮烈牺牲表示拥护
But instead, embrace his ultimate sacrifice

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,360
因为在他的遗体之上
and build upon the foundation he laid

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,290
有一个更加强大的身影
with an even mightier hand.

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,320
恕我直言 红蜘蛛指挥…呃 红蜘蛛陛下
With all due respect, commander star... er, lord Starscream.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,530
说吧 说吧 什么事？
Yes, yes. What is it?

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,050
如果连威震天陛下都没能带领我们征服地球
If we failed to conquer Earth under lord Megatron's command

15
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,900
现在面对那些汽车人 我们还有多少胜算？
what hope do we have now while the Autobots still defend it.

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,320
那我就明说了吧
Ahh... Allow me to be crystal clear.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,960
千万年来 我一直站在我们已故主人的身后
I studied for millennia, under our former master.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,770
统领你们绰绰有余
Thus I am equate to lead you.

19
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,350
我 威震天的合法继承人
I, Megatron's true heir

20
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,560
红蜘蛛陛下 破坏大帝！
Lord Starscream, Emperor of Destruction!

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,850
这个…
[Murmurs...]

22
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,030
打着我的旗号却毫无斗志的士兵有何用！
What use our troops who can't arise to the task of inflicting unspeakable destruction in my name!

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,110
等等…
Hm... But wait

24
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,830
传说有个武艺超群的战士
legend tells of one capable warrior

25
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,700
正巧此人就在这个星球上
one who exists here upon this very planet

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,600
应该可以让他唯我是从
one who can be student to my master.

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,800
擎天柱 你怎么闷闷不乐？
Optimus, why so glum?

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,660
这颗星球…
This planet

29
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,830
甚至所有星球 终于逃出了威震天的魔爪
all planets are finally free from Megatron's tyranny.

30
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,260
我不否认 救护车
I do not disagree, Ratchet.

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,470
只是 我比较倾向于改变威震天的意愿
It's just, a small part of me hoped to change Megatron's mind

32
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,980
而不是消灭他的火种
not to extinguish his spark.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,730
擎天柱！那个恶霸的死因不在于你
Optimus, his vileness was not slain by your hand

34
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,030
而是因为他的狂妄自大！
but by his own twisted arrogance.

35
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,440
很抱歉
I'm sorry

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
我知道你们两个交情很深
I know the two of you have quite a history.

37
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,990
但那个曾和我并肩作战的威震天 很久之前就不在了
But the Megatron whom I once fought beside perished eons ago

38
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,090
一旦成为霸天虎 便不再回头
the day he chose to become a Decepticon.

39
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,230
霸天虎现在可能军心涣散 但他们并非群龙无首
The Decepticons may be in disarray, but they aren't without leadership.

40
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,560
何况红蜘蛛不是威震天
And while Starscream is no Megatron

41
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,030
他从不按常理出牌
he is far from predictable.

42
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,520
霸天虎！
Decepticons!

43
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,780
我们遭到袭击！
We are under attack!

44
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,960
不是袭击 救护车
It's no attack, Ratchet.

45
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,780
是我的火山
It's my volcano.

46
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,240
曾经是
Was.

47
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,430
别动 隔板！
Hold still Bulkhead

48
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,510
木星还少个大红斑
Jupiter needs its red spot.

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,740
又洒了
Woopsy.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,790
这…看在火种源的份上 到底在搞什么？！
What... in the Allspark... is going on in here?

51
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,920
我们明天要交作业
Our projects are due tomorrow.

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,890
可能还要装一个小东西
Maybe we need one of these doohickeys.

53
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,450
你是摩托车 阿尔茜
You are a motorcycle, Arcee.

54
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,290
你难道不会制造摩托发动机吗？
Shouldn't you know how to build the motorcycle engine?

55
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,930
你还是人类呢 杰克
You're a human, Jack.

56
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,450
你能造出小肠来吗？
Can you build me a small intestine?

57
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,070
只会添乱！
You are... making a mess!

58
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,920
但科学作业在成绩里占的比重很大
But the science affairs are big parts of our grade.

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,960
是啊！如果隔板不帮我把太阳系模型弄完…
Yea! If Bulkhead doesn't help me finish this model of our solar system...

60
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,060
隔板怎么会了解你们的太阳系？
Oh? And what does Bulkhead know of your solar system?

61
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,040
大黄蜂见过你们的火山吗？还有…
Or Bumblebee of your volcanoes? Or...

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,840
…阿尔茜没见过摩托车吗？
...Arcee of our motorcycles?

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,860
说得对！我们不是地球人！
Precisely! We're not earthlings!

64
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,770
他们也不是科学家
 And they are not scientists.

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,760
但汽车人是他们的守护者 救护车
But the Autobots are their guardians, Ratchet.

66
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,300
帮助我们的年轻朋友完成作业 顺便熟悉地球 何尝不可呢？
Would it hurt to learn more of earth by helping our young friends with their school work?

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,920
那…这些年轻朋友也应该熟悉一下塞博特恩
Well... Maybe our young friends should try learning more of Cybertron.

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,260
大战期间
During the Great War

69
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,760
这个鬼地方贮藏了许多能量
so much energon was hidden on this forsaken rock

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,180
我们的先帝派塞博特恩最棒的战士来守护它们
that our departed master sent some of Cybertron's greatest to guard it.

71
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,550
是真正的勇士 处于沉睡之中
True warriors, now lying in stasis

72
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,840
等待着被唤醒
waiting to be reawakened.

73
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,460
威震天明知道时日不多
Such folly that late in life

74
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,680
还愚蠢地跑到太空深处去寻找战士
Megatron searched distant space for warriors

75
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,800
却忽略了这里 就在他的脚下
rather than here, beneath his feet.

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,920
你说无法找到他的信号 是什么意思？
What do you mean you can't pinpoint his signal?

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,960
我知道就在附近！
I know we are close!

78
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,220
把你的探测器功率加大！
Boost the power to your sensors!

79
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,730
是的…在那儿…
Yesss... There...

80
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,360
真的吗 大黄蜂？
Really Bumblebee?

81
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,610
那你是怎么进战士班的？
Then how do you make warrior class?

82
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,440
但我看过你打仗 身手不错的！
But I've seen you in action, you are awesome!

83
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,750
我也这么认为 拉夫
I second your opinion, Raf.

84
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,440
但汽车人的生命周期远比人类的要长
But Autobot life cycles are much longer than those of humans.

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,050
说起来很难让你信服
And though it may be hard to believe our young scout

86
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,530
但这位年轻的侦察员的确需要累积经验
still has much to experience.

87
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,140
有能量外露 而且正在移动
Exposed energon, and it's on the move.

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,730
既然不是我们在动 猜猜会是谁？
And since we ain't moving it, guess who must be?

89
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,270
霸天虎
Decepticons.

90
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,400
威震天不是死了吗？
Without Megatron?

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,200
威震天是死了
Unfortunately Megatron's legacy will live on

92
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,980
但恐怕很多人想坐上他的宝座
as others rise to take his place.

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,860
汽车人 你们得完成作业
Autobots, you have projects to complete.

94
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,450
救护车 我可能需要帮手
Ratchet, I may require aid.

95
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,500
既然科学作业在他们的成绩里占的比重很大
Science affair is a big part of their grade?

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,760
也许我最好留下来 给他们提点建议
Perhaps I'm better suited to remain behind and advise.

97
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,760
好吧
Very well.

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,210
大黄蜂 我们去看看这个会飞的能量
Bumblebee, let us see about this energon in transit.

99
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,290
很好 声波
Excellent, Soundwave.

100
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,970
能量块
The cube.

101
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,990
注入的能量
The energon infusion

102
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,400
有效果了！
it's working.

103
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,850
不 大黄蜂 能量不会消失
No Bumblebee, it does not.

104
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,730
坚守岗位 等我的命令
Hold your position, and wait my command.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,260
苏醒吧 战士
Awaken, warrior

106
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,120
醒过来 侍奉你的新主人！
rise and serve your new master.

107
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,780
天震只侍奉一个主人
Skyquake serves only one master.

108
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,250
很好
Excellent

109
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,140
你的忠诚和奉献精神将成为军队的好榜样
your loyalty and devotion will set a fine example for the troops.

110
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,960
不必拘谨 天震
No need to be timid, Skyquake

111
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,460
俯首称臣吧
you may bow.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,480
你没听懂我的话
You failed to grasp my meaning.

113
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,590
派我来这里执行任务的
I am here on a mission

114
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,850
是我唯一的主人 威震天
assigned to me by my one master, Megatron.

115
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,350
对 他嘛…
Yes, him.

116
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,730
很不幸 威震天已经离我们而去了
Sadly Megatron is no longer with us.

117
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,190
不可能！
Impossible.

118
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,950
为什么所有人都难以接受事实？
Why is it so difficult for everyone to accept?

119
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,540
天震 是我把你找到
Skyquake, I located you

120
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,880
是我把你唤醒
I awakened you

121
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,190
所以我 红蜘蛛陛下
thus I, lord  Starscream

122
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,660
现在是你的主人！
am now your master!

123
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,810
好久不见 天震
It has been a while, Skyquake.

124
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,140
擎天柱
Optimus Prime

125
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,740
在泰科纳战役之后我就再没见过你
I haven't seen you since the battle of Technar.

126
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,500
威震天命令我来消灭你
Megatron ordered me to annihilate you.

127
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
那都是陈年旧事了
That was a long time ago.

128
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,810
或许是 擎天柱
That may be, Prime.

129
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,480
但命令还是要执行的！
But my order still stand!

130
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,410
这古老的战争还值得打下去吗？
Is this ancient war still worth fighting

131
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,220
那么多同伴悄然离去
when so many comrades have been lost

132
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,180
那么多星球毁于一旦
and worlds destroyed?

133
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,120
如果你想成为一个真正的领袖 红蜘蛛
If you want to be a true leader, Starscream

134
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,870
那就不要走威震天的老路
then stray from Megatron's path

135
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,790
你要带领霸天虎走向和平
and lead the Decepticons toward peace.

136
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,070
我会真心考虑停战的
I would be willing to consider a truce

137
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:41,210
只要你真心向我称臣 擎天柱
if you would be willing to bow before me, Optimus Prime.

138
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,300
又是称臣？称称这个沉不沉！
Again? Bow to this!

139
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,330
天震 这是一个新时代 一个新世界
Skyquake, this is a new era, on another world

140
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,600
加入汽车人这边 帮我彻底终结这场战争吧！
side with the Autobots and help me end this conflict forever!

141
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,750
我永远不会与你们为伍！
I will never side with a Prime! Ummmaaa...

142
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,500
既然有了天震 我还要和平干嘛？
What need have I for peace when I have Skyquake?

143
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,610
教训他一下
With some discipline

144
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,870
他就会懂得尊敬他的新主人
he will learn to respect his new master.

145
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,700
只要他们知道 天震在我的命令下消灭了擎天柱
And once it becomes known that Skyquake destroyed Optimus Prime under my command

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,580
全体霸天虎都会对我心悦诚服！
all Decepticons will gratefully bow to me.

147
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,220
大黄蜂 不！
Bumblebee, no!

148
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,840
一刻也不要漏掉 声波！
Do not miss a single moment, Soundwave!

149
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:22,820
我们要为擎天柱的辞世拍个纪录片 以儆后人！
We shall need a visual documentation of Optimus Prime's demise, for the historical record.

150
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,400
天震还没有扫描伪装形态
Skyquake has not yet acquired a vehicle mode.

151
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,480
后撤！
Fall back!

152
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,090
年纪越大 胆子越小吗 擎天柱？
So time has made you a coward, Prime?

153
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,810
我看看 在哪呢？
Let's see, where is it?

154
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,460
这是什么？
Em, what is it?

155
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,930
到时候你就知道了
You'll find out.

156
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,690
可是…救护车
But Ratchet

157
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,900
我不是该自己动手吗？
shouldn't I be doing the work?

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,070
别动！看着就行了 学着吧
Yi, yap, yap, yap... Don't touch! Just watch. And learn.

159
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,770
那我们去帮杰克和神子完成他们的…
So we'll just go help Jack and Miko finish their...

160
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,950
在我的监督之外？
Without my supervision?

161
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,460
你们也想做到最好吧？
You want them to be right, don't you?

162
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,100
那就欣赏大师的手笔吧！
Then watch a master at work!

163
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,540
控制狂！
Control freak!

164
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,370
他们已经出了视线范围！
We've lost sight of them.

165
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,590
声波 你怎么不去追踪他们？
Soundwave! Why aren't you tracking them!

166
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,100
什么 怎么回事？
What, what is it?

167
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,580
又一个霸天虎的生命信号？
A second Decepticon life signal?

168
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,280
但天震是唯一在这个地区待命的
But Skyquake is the only sleeper buried in this area.

169
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,000
在我们被毁掉的太空桥那里？
The site of our destroyed Space Bridge?

170
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,010
你不是想说
You are not telling me

171
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,510
那个生命信号属于…
that life signal belongs...

172
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,680
…威震天吧？
to Megatron?

173
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,100
可…可他离爆炸点太近了
B, b, b... but he was microns from the detonation point.

174
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,360
没人能在那样的爆炸中生还！
Nothing could have survived that blast!

175
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,820
你的传感器一定有问题！
Your sensors must be faulty.

176
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,590
别理它！
Ignore the contact.

177
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,920
把坐标删除！
Delete the coordinates!

178
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,010
唉 我在说什么呢？
Eh what am I saying?

179
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,510
当然了 去调查一下也无妨
Of course, this must be investigated.

180
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,030
如果真的是威震天陛下
If Lord Megatron is up there

181
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,340
我就去前往迎驾
I shall bring him home.

182
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,490
呆在这里监视情况
Remain here and monitor the outcome.

183
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,790
等天震毁灭擎天柱火种的那一刻
When Skyquake snuffs Prime's spark

184
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,610
我要亲自验证
I must bear witness.

185
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,030
“…要亲自验证”
"...must bear witness."

186
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,610
T6A号呼叫指挥中心
T6A to central command.

187
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,120
我们监测到来自不明物体的信号 可能是敌军
We are picking up transmissions originating from un-identified technology possibly hostile.

188
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,610
我们正前去调查
We are moving to investigate.

189
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,580
不行 T6A！
Negative T6A

190
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,630
我是特工威廉・福勒
this is special agent William Fowler intercepting.

191
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,360
删除你的报告记录
Strike your report from the record

192
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,840
向我提供源坐标
and provide the origin coordinates.

193
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,610
我会去处理的
I'll take it from here.

194
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,930
把你砸扁真是大材小用 小虫子
It will be a shame to crush you, bug

195
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,650
但这是我的职责
but it is my duty.

196
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,830
好计谋 大黄蜂！
Excellent strategy, Bumblebee.

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,610
天震 老实趴着吧！
Skyquake, stay down.

198
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
福勒？
Fowler?

199
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,760
福勒探员 快撤退！
Agent Fowler, fall back!

200
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,590
这下我算开了眼了
Well, I'll be a bald eagle.

201
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,610
已获得制空权！
Air superiority achieved.

202
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,230
在我的眼皮底下盗取机密军用飞机设计 我决不容忍！
Stealing plans for a classified military aircraft will not be tolerated on my watch!

203
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,770
热能追踪导弹！
Heat seekers!

204
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,140
别想追上我！
I still got it.

205
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,760
没人能在这里生还
No one could have survived this.

206
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,990
如我所料 是传感器故障
Ahh... As I suspected, faulty sensors.

207
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,950
我现在最不想听到的谣言就是 威震天还…
The last thing I need now are rumors that Megatron is still...

208
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,660
威震天…
Megatron...

209
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,330
怎么会这样？
But how?

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,530
黑暗能量
Ah, dark energon.

211
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,900
所有人都以为你已经仙逝了
Everyone believes you are deceased.

212
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,870
我怎么忍心让他们失望呢 主人？
Who am I to disappoint them, master?

213
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,550
这一次 永远安息吧！
And this time, stay dead!

214
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,430
声波！你听见了吗？
Soundwave, if you are listening

215
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,730
我找到威震天陛下了
I have found Lord Megatron.

216
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,800
他情况…不太乐观
And he is... unwell.

217
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,710
必须把他送到治疗舱
We must transport him to sick bay

218
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,980
要快！
immediately.

219
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,580
福勒探员 我们请求立刻支援！
Agent Fowler, we require immediate assistance!

220
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,490
不用谢 伙计
Anytime, fellow.

221
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,070
马上要着陆了！
Ground force coming fast!

222
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,900
着陆快乐 虎子
How're the landings, Con?

223
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,830
如果天震没有步他主人的后尘
Had Skyquake chosen to stray from his master's path

224
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,050
我们今天就不会置他于死地了
we might not be burying him today.

225
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:08,460
大黄蜂 让你孤身冒险也许不算是上策
Bumblebee, putting yourself at risk was perhaps not the wisest of strategies

226
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,680
但你的表现令人钦佩
but you performed admirably.

227
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,790
你们回来了！
there you are.

228
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,390
快说 他们觉得我的 呃…我们的作业怎么样？
Well, how are my, eh, our projects received?

229
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,750
这个嘛…
Well...

230
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,510
仲代小姐 那是哪个星球？
Miss Nakadai, what planet would that be?

231
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,260
嗯…塞博特恩啊
Em, Cybertron?

232
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,920
它…个头不小 达比先生
It's... large, Mr. Darby

233
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,880
可它能运行吗？
but, is it operational?

234
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,140
不知道该不该问 埃斯基维尔先生
I hesitate to ask, Mr. Esquivel

235
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,880
不过…这是活火山吗？
but, eh, is it active?

236
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,170
哼 如果在我们的星球
Well, on our planet

237
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,050
你们会获得最高分的！
you would have been awarded the highest honors.

238
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,130
我就不该参和进来！再也不帮忙了
I get absolutely no credit!  Let's see if I help them.

239
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,220
说得对 大黄蜂
Indeed, Bumblebee

240
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,080
我们的人类朋友不该走上救护车的老路
our human friends would have been wise to stray from Ratchet's path.

241
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,430
知道威震天陛下情况稳定
The troops will be pleased to hear of our success

242
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,210
士兵们一定会很高兴的
in rushing Lord Megatron into stasis.

243
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,270
但愿我们的主人能挺过这一关
Let us hope that our master pulls through.
