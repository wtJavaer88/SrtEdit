1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,070
在上一集中
Previously on "Transformers Prime..."

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,310
隔板 救护车人呢？
Bulkhead, where is Ratchet?

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,430
他被掳走了
He's gone.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,870
如果威震天真的想要重铸终极之锁
If Megatron is truly rebuilding the Omega lock

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,350
那么合成能量可能是一种不可或缺的原料
synthetic Energon might be a necessary component.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,770
大脑神经接入器获取了什么信息？
What did the cortical psychic patch yield?

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,620
只确认了合成能量的配方确实不稳定
Only that the synthetic Energon formula is unstable.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,840
如果应答器还在激光鸟身上
If the transponder were still attached to Laserbeak

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,770
我们就可以跟踪它
we could follow it.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,190
也就是说 我们要让这个小玩意飞回虎子的指挥中心
So, we're gonna let this doohickey fly back to 'Con central...

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,690
并给我们指明救护车的位置
And lead us right to Ratchet.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,460
你们应该期盼我们被毁灭的家园恢复昔日的辉煌吧？
You would like to see the ruins of our devastated home world restored to their former brilliance.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,530
你不过是想再次征服塞博特恩
You would just try to conquer Cybertron all over again.

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,440
这个事实不会改变
But that does not change the fact

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,060
你或许是让塞博特恩重见天日的唯一希望
that you may be Cybertron's only hope of ever seeing life again.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,190
我答应你
I'll do it.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,200
真的不用给侦察器装个GPS吗？
You sure we don't need to install a GPS on our scout here?

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,690
太冒险了
Too risky...

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,970
这种小伎俩对双方来说 太容易识破了
both sides are getting real good at rooting out that kind of trick.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,480
况且 我们用不着追踪装置
Besides, we don't need a tracker.

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,180
我们有擎天柱
We have Optimus.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,910
但虎子不会发现你吗 大块头？
But won't the 'Cons see you coming, big guy?

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,040
等他们发现时已经晚了
Not until it's too late.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,020
我们会做好准备 接到命令立即行动 长官
We'll be prepared for immediate mobilization upon your command, sir.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,280
祝你好运 擎天柱
Good luck, Optimus.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,030
注意安全
Be safe.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,260
无论结局如何
Whatever the outcome

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,510
相信救护车一定会为你们的努力而骄傲
know that Ratchet would be most proud of your contribution.

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,280
来吧 孩子 把这玩意儿送上天
Come on, kid. Let's light this thing.

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,510
把量子-数字测量仪给我拿来
Fetch me the quantum-cyber measure.

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
哼
Hmm.

32
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,680
我像是给你打下手的吗 汽车人？
Do I look like hired help to you, Autobot?

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,160
击倒 必须满足贵客的要求
Knockout, attend to the needs of our esteemed guest.

34
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,400
遵命…
As you command.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,520
已经得知 这种塞博特恩网状物
So, we know this cyber matter to be produced

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,370
是非典型分子置换反应的产物
by an atypical molecular-displacement reaction.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,710
大量实验证据表明
Extensive empirical evidence indicates

38
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,350
合成能量配方的不稳定性是问题的根源
the fundamental instability within the Synth-En formulation to be the cause.

39
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,550
双盲分析做了吗？
Double-blind analysis?

40
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,990
当然 实验结果只是证实了我最初的假设
Naturally. The results only confirmed my original hypothesis.

41
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,510
一旦修正了错误变量
Once the erroneous variable has been corrected for

42
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,900
稳定的合成物将会与C.N.A.完美结合
the stabilized synthetic material will bind properly with cybernucleic acid.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
从而产生稳定的塞博特恩网状物
And produce a stable form of cyber matter.

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,410
不可思议
Remarkable.

45
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,850
没错 似乎是天意
Yes. Quite an act of providence.

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,840
知道吗 要不是让你们干掉了那些野兽
And to think that, had we not let you destroy the beasts

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,740
也不会取得今天的成果
none of this would be possible.

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,890
“让”我们？
Let?

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,460
我是说…
Uh, what I meant to say was...

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,010
你之前索要的样本可不会凭空蹦出来 是吧？
those specimens you requested earlier aren't going to prepare themselves, are they?

51
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,980
任务艰巨 时间紧迫 医生
There is much to do and little time, Doctor.

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,760
该继续工作了吧？
Shall we get back to work?

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,790
当然
Certainly.

54
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,440
擎天柱 你消失有一阵子了
Prime. Haven't heard from you in a while.

55
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,870
一切还顺利吗？
Everything all right up there?

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,190
目前还好 福勒探员
So far, Agent Fowler.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,940
虎子识别了激光鸟的信号后会怎样？
What happens when the 'Cons I.D. Laserbeak's signal?

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,190
只希望擎天柱能尽快看到战舰
We're counting on Optimus making visual contact with the warship

59
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,130
赶在被雷达发现之前
before its radar can detect the ship.

60
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,930
老大不会有事的
The boss will be fine.

61
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,240
我担心的并不是擎天柱
It's not Optimus I'm worried about.

62
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,610
击倒 我需要一个新鲜的C.N.A.样本
Knockout. I require a fresh CNA sample.

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,240
噢…我…
Ohh, I...

64
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,380
击倒 把这个拿来 击倒 把那个给我
"Knockout, bring this. Knockout, get that."

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,210
很显然 取货成了我的新特长
Apparently, fetching is all I'm good for lately.

66
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,230
不久前 我还是这个实验室的老大
It wasn't all that long ago I used to run this lab.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,710
现在人人都拿我当跑腿儿的使唤
Now I am everyone's gofer.

68
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,220
有事么？
Yes?

69
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,350
绝缘探针！
The... the isoprobe!

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
我…没找到
I-I... don't see one.

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,900
我就知道…
What a surprise.

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,390
哦
Ohh.

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,790
您还要点什么？
Anything else?

74
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,430
谢谢
Thank you.

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
不客气
You're welcome.

76
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,260
我们即将进入一个新纪元！
We stand at the very precipice of a new age!

77
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,840
你是说扫描器探测到了激光鸟的信号？
What do you mean, our scanners have detected Laserbeak's Signal?

78
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,940
红蜘蛛
Starscream.

79
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,200
你不是摧毁汽车人基地了吗？
You did destroy the Autobot base

80
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,610
有漏网之鱼吗？
did you not?

81
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,660
已经夷为平地了 陛下
With great fervor, my lord.

82
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,470
您何出此言？
Why do you ask?

83
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,260
激光鸟的通讯频率出现在了雷达上
Because Laserbeak's frequency has been detected on radar.

84
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,350
这不可能！
But that's not possible.

85
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,450
他不就在声波的胸前吗
He's right here in Soundwave's torso.

86
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,920
也就是说 这应该是汽车人耍的诡计
Which is why this would appear to be an Autobot trick

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,620
目的是查探我们的位置 营救那个俘虏
designed to uncover our position and rescue a certain prisoner.

88
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,690
不过 我倒想问问
But then one has to wonder

89
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,100
他们怎么可能实施如此复杂的行动？
how would they possibly manage to execute such a complex task

90
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,730
现在他们连基本设施都没有！
without the proper facilities!

91
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,150
我…呃…
I, uh...

92
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,060
请允许我去查明原委
Allow me to troubleshoot.

93
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,570
哦…谜题的最后一环
Oh... The final piece of the puzzle.

94
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,510
多谢了 霸天虎工程技术
Thank you, Decepticon engineering.

95
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,760
震荡波
Shockwave!

96
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,850
终极之锁的组装已进入最终阶段
Assembly of the Omega lock is  entering the final stage.

97
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,080
我需要你前去指导
Your guidance is required.

98
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,730
遵命 我的君王
Understood, my liege.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,470
击倒 我不在时你来监督客人
Knockout, supervise our guest in my absence.

100
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,890
哇 我真是受宠若惊
Wow. Thanks for the big vote of confidence.

101
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,660
我决不能让稳定的配方落到威震天手中
I can't allow Megatron to possess the stabilized formula.

102
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,640
现在不行
Not now...

103
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,080
以后也不行
or ever.

104
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,060
我的天啊 出什么事了？
For the love of... what is happening?!

105
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,560
配方不稳定…
The formula's instability...

106
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,890
一定是引起了连锁反应！
it must have triggered a chain reaction!

107
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,530
卫兵 快来帮我灭火
Guards, help me extinguish this inferno

108
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,480
不然它会烧毁我们的项目…
before it scorches the project...

109
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,320
还有我的涂装！
And my finish!

110
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,990
擎天柱！
Optimus Prime!

111
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,160
你竟敢苟活于世！
How dare you continue to live?

112
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,570
给我把那个汽车人轰成碎片！
Blast that Autobot into oblivion!

113
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,790
那个频率并非来自擎天柱
The frequency isn't emanating from Prime

114
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,480
而且还在移动
and it's still on the move.

115
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,710
干掉他！
Finish him!

116
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,590
如果不能在信号源发现战舰之前找到它
If I cannot find the source of the signal before it finds the warship

117
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,870
威震天会要了我们脑袋的！
Megatron will have our heads!

118
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,460
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

119
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,980
呃 出了点小麻烦
Uh, there has been a situation...

120
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,570
呃 其实是个小事故 我真的…
Uh, more like an accident, really. I...

121
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,380
别绕弯子！
Spit... it... out!

122
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,100
俘虏逃跑了！
The prisoner has escaped!

123
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,180
现身吧 现身吧 别藏了
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

124
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
这把老骨头还挺灵活
Not bad for an old bot.

125
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,450
如果你杀了我
If you terminate me

126
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,520
你就永远也得不到配方！
you'll never get your hands on the formula!

127
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,520
哦 别把话说那么绝 医生
Oh, I wouldn't be so certain, Doctor.

128
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,370
我们的专家正在努力揭开你的…
My experts are working diligently to disentangle your...

129
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,380
装模作样的面具
false trail as we speak.

130
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,920
找到了
There you are.

131
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,750
给我下去吧
And down you go.

132
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,280
不！
No!

133
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,450
啊！我需要环陆桥 快！
Aah! I need a ground bridge... now!

134
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,170
啧 啧 啧…想得美
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Nice try.

135
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,670
我还是把它放回原处吧
I'll just put this back where it belongs.

136
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,660
频谱分析确认
Spectrum analysis confirms

137
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,120
合成能量已经稳定
that the synthetic Energon is stable.

138
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,330
配方制作完毕
The formula is now complete.

139
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,880
什么时候能开始生产？
And your timetable for production?

140
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,650
有了超级加速科技的协助
With the aid of hyper-acceleration technology

141
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,830
不会太久
not long.

142
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,330
哦 可惜你无法眼看着自己的研究成果开枝散叶
Ohh, a pity you won't live long enough to witness the fruits of your labor.

143
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,990
尽管我很感激你做出的贡献 医生
But as much as we appreciate your contributions, Doctor

144
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,730
但我有个诺言必须要兑现
I've made a promise to someone that I intend to keep.

145
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,920
你是不是感到回天无力 汽车人？
Do you feel defenseless, Autobot?

146
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,460
很好 现在你知道 我的巨狰狞弟兄们
Good. Now you know what my fellow Predacons endured...

147
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,750
被你们屠杀前作何感受了！
right before you massacred them!

148
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,150
擎天柱呼叫基地 请回答
Optimus to base... come in.

149
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,340
指挥官 你已经确认了战舰位置吗？
Commander, have you determined the warship's location?

150
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,120
没有 通天晓
No, Ultra Magnus.

151
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,810
应答器被毁掉了
The transponder has been destroyed.

152
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,890
寻找救护车的任务几乎退回了原点
We are no closer to finding Ratchet than when we began.

153
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,600
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

154
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,610
数字化地球所需的塞博特恩网状物已开始合成
synthesis of the cyber matter required to cyberform Earth has commenced.

155
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,580
干得漂亮 震荡波！
Splendid, Shockwave!

156
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,330
把终极之锁移动到指定位置
Move the Omega lock into position.

157
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,110
我要做好一切准备
I want to be ready.

158
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,740
终于 可以摆脱这个悲惨的种族了…
At last, good riddance to a wretched species.

159
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,410
值得一提的是他们倒很擅长制造帅气的车辆
Although I will say they manufacture some fine-looking automobiles.

160
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,770
给我个痛快吧
Just get it over with.

161
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,470
我也没脸活下去了
It's not like I could ever live with myself

162
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,430
现在我成了人类灭绝的帮凶
knowing the role I played in humankind's extinction.

163
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,400
但如果你想为同伴报仇
But if you want to avenge your cohorts

164
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,940
杀掉我并不是终点！
don't stop with me!

165
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,160
威震天才是你的最终目标！
Keep avenging all the way to Megatron!

166
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,940
什么？！你什么意思？！
What?! What do you mean?!

167
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,620
是你那高高在上的首领 想要除掉你们巨狰狞
Your high and mighty leader wanted your Predacons exterminated...

168
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,290
我们仅仅是他的棋子而已！
and simply allowed us to do his dirty work for him!

169
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,420
你是为了保命才信口开河！
Nothing but a false claim to save your own spark!

170
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,320
咳
Hea...

171
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,990
你自认为是智慧生物 不是吗？！
You consider yourself an intelligent being, don't you?!

172
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,570
那就放下你的野兽本能
Then rise above your base instincts...

173
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,580
分析当时的情况
and analyze the situation.

174
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,770
那天我们拼命地追查
We followed the trail that day with the desperate hope

175
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,880
只希望能找到一座能量矿
that it would lead to an Energon mine.

176
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,500
从没想过会发现震荡波的实验室
We had no idea we would find Shockwave's laboratory.

177
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,150
这个巧合太离谱了！
The coincidence barely seems plausible!

178
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,320
因为那根本不是巧合！
Because it wasn't a coincidence.

179
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,790
故意用能量引诱我们过去的…
The Energon was clearly planted to lure us there...

180
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,590
就是威震天！
by Megatron!

181
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,940
我的君王为何要毁灭我们？
Why would my liege wish to destroy us?

182
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,350
在见识过你的强大本领之后
Having just been on the receiving end of your might

183
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,930
我忽然有了个想法…
one theory springs to mind...

184
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,810
威震天惧怕你
Megatron fears you

185
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,980
还有你的同类
and any like you.

186
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,240
威震天陛下 冲云霄在大开杀戒
Lord Megatron, Predaking is on a rampage and moving rapidly... toward the...

187
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,420
他正快速冲向…噢…啊！
ohh! Aah!

188
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,200
汽车人基地 能收到吗？
Autobot base, do you read?

189
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,260
我是救护车 有人能听到吗？
This is Ratchet. Can anyone hear me?

190
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,870
清晰无比 老朋友
Loud and clear, old friend.

191
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,130
- 太好了！\N- 是救护车！
- Whoo\N - hoo!\N - Yes! Ratchet!

192
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,350
我就知道他没事！
I knew he was all right!

193
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,530
听我说
Listen to me...

194
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,620
威震天设法在他的战舰上重建了终极之锁
Megatron has managed to rebuild the Omega lock on board his warship.

195
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,570
我已经关闭了霸天虎的护盾
I've deactivated the Decepticon shielding system.

196
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,850
你们应该可以定位我的坐标
You should be able to get a fix on my coordinates.

197
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,030
擎天柱 必须尽快行动！
Optimus, you must hurry!

198
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,880
威震天正准备把地球数字化 十万火急！
Megatron is preparing to cyberform Earth as we speak!

199
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,520
救护车…
Ratchet...

200
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,290
汽车人 锁定坐标
Autobots, lock on to those coordinates

201
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,300
准备突袭战舰
and prepare to storm the warship.

202
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,800
领袖下令了
You heard our leader.

203
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,050
既然要打 就战个痛快！
We're going in, and we're going in heavy.

204
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,900
武装起来！
Gear up.

205
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,260
他们也不知道告个别
They can't leave without saying goodbye.

206
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,340
没时间了 也没有必要
No time for that, and no need.

207
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,370
他们会回来的
They'll be back.

208
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,640
开启环陆桥
Initiating groundbridge.

209
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,350
领袖卫队的成员们
Members of team Prime

210
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,190
汽车人和人类朋友
Autobot and human

211
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,140
能领导你们我深感荣幸
it has been my honor to lead you.

212
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,060
今时今日 两个世界的命运岌岌可危
On this day, the fates of two worlds hang in the balance

213
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,980
而这场战役很可能是我们的最后一战
and the battle to come may very well be our last.

214
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,500
为了地球 为了塞博特恩
But for Earth, for Cybertron

215
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,120
为了我们的战友救护车
for our comrade, Ratchet

216
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,780
我们必须攻下霸天虎的战舰
we must take the Decepticon warship.

217
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,720
您确定和那个半兽人正面对决
Are you sure confronting the beast-bot directly

218
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,220
是明智之举吗 威震天陛下？
is the best option, lord Megatron?

219
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,300
让我们看看 这位自封的王者
We shall see how his majesty

220
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,570
如何应付我们手中最强大的武器…
fares against the most powerful weapon in our vault...

221
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,020
黑暗星辰剑！
the Dark Star Saber!

222
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,570
威震天！
Megatron!

223
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,790
我这就去取刚才提到的那个小玩意儿
I'll just go fetch that little something we talked about.

224
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,700
真的是你下令毁灭我的野兽大军吗？！
Is it true that you ordered the annihilation of my army?!

225
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,610
确实如此 而我唯一的错误就是没有斩草除根
Indeed, and my only mistake was not seeing the extermination through.

226
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,050
我要把你大卸八块！
I will tear you apart!

227
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,820
我…啊！
I... aah!

228
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,590
表现不错
That's the spirit.

229
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,490
但作为卡隆角斗场的冠军
But I was a champion of the pits of Chaon

230
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,050
我拥有的不仅是蛮力…
not only due to my savage might...

231
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,860
还有脑子！
but also my cunning!

232
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,980
你该听从我的忠告 在我面前保持野兽形态
You should have heeded my advice and faced me as a beast.

233
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,890
太精彩了 我的君王！
Bravo, my liege.

234
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,610
这可不是常有的事 见证已经绝迹的种族再遭灭顶！
It isn't every day one witnesses the extinction of a species all over again.

235
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,390
终极武器登场喽！
One ultimate weapon coming right up.

236
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,040
呃 满身鳞片的黑大个哪儿去了？
Uh, where's tall, dark, and scaly?

237
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,390
汇报情况！
Report.

238
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,030
威震天陛下 战舰正遭受攻击
Lord Megatron, the ship is under attack...

239
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,480
是汽车人
by the Autobots.

240
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,740
战舰不是处于隐形状态吗
But the warship is cloaked.

241
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,350
这怎么可能？
How is that possible?

242
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,400
那个军医还活着！
The medic lives!

243
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,070
动用所有剩余力量！
Mobilize what remains of our forces!

244
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,550
全力保护终极之锁 不惜一切代价！
The Omega lock must be defended at all costs!

245
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,460
如果擎天柱想主动开战
If Optimus Prime wishes to wage a battle

246
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,310
赌上地球和塞博特恩的命运
for the fate of both Earth and Cybertron...

247
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,420
那么我就如他所愿
then I shall oblige him.

248
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,220
在此与他决一死战！
This will be our last stand!
