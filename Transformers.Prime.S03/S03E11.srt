1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,270
在上一集中
Previously on Transformers Prime:

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,850
简单地说 这种化合物可以让我们数字化整个世界
Simply put, this combination of elements could allow us to cyberform entire worlds.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,110
那我们就先集中手头的所有资源\N全力修复终极之锁吧
Then we will focus upon the successful reconstruction of the Omega Lock.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,410
擎天柱！虎子又露头了
Prime! It's 'Cons again.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,260
而且被我们抓了个正着
In progress this time.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,500
救护车 我们要带回一个霸天虎俘虏
Ratchet, We will be returning with a Decepticon prisoner.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,990
威震天为何要窃取人类科技？
Why is Megatron stealing human technology?

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,360
他究竟想要建造什么？
What is he attempting to build?

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,320
击倒从汽车人的医生哪里获取了这个未完成配方
Knock out first procured this unfinished shamble from the Autobot medic.

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,920
那么最快的解决办法 就是将那名医生弄到手
The most efficient means to an end may be to recruit that medic.

11
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,100
只有大灾变才能毁灭塞博特恩上的巨狰狞种族
It took a cataclysm to extinguish Cybertron's original Predacon inhabitants.

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,450
而你根本就不是我的对手 擎天柱
You never stood a chance against me, Prime.

13
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,230
事实上 今天你大限到了！
In fact, the time has come for your extinction.

14
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,960
头儿 可否速战速决？
Permission to hasten our progress, chief?

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,820
批准
Granted.

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,310
这场战斗可不适合仅有一只手的汽车人
This is no place for a one-handed Autobot.

17
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,050
一只破手换一只好眼 这买卖划算
I'll take one bum hand over one good eye any day.

18
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,990
收手吧 巨狰狞！
Stand down, Predacon.

19
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,710
我是冲云霄！
I am Predaking

20
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,770
而我永远不会向你们屈服！
And I will never bow to your kind!

21
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,190
冲云霄 我得知我们的目标正受到威胁
Predaking, I have been informed that our objective is at risk.

22
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,390
去保护它 快！
Secure it. Now.

23
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,000
指挥官 目标已安全
Commander, objective secured.

24
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,060
现在是你投降的好机会
Now might be a fine time for surrender.

25
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,690
根据逻辑推断 若不是…
A logical assumption, were it not for...

26
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,840
啊…呀！
Ah... aah!

27
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,700
救护车 立即接我们回基地
Ratchet, we require immediate transport back to base.

28
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,920
嗯？
Huh?

29
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,520
空姐 有个家伙正站在我们飞机的翅膀上！
Stewardess, there's a man on the wing of this plane!

30
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,580
救护车 你听到了吗？
Ratchet, do you read?

31
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,040
呃…阿尔茜？
Uh... Arcee...?

32
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,230
隔板
Bulkhead?

33
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,730
一切都好吧？
Is everything all right?

34
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,540
救护车他人呢？
Where's Ratchet?

35
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,080
他…他被掳走了…
He's... he's gone.

36
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,410
你想从我这儿得到什么？
What do you want from me?

37
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,510
事实上 我需要你的协助
Your assistance, actually.

38
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,160
来帮我们完成一个小…科研项目
To help complete a little... science project.

39
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,870
我绝不会合作的
I will never cooperate.

40
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,880
震荡波可不需要你的合作…
Shockwave does not require your cooperation

41
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,690
来汲取你脑中的知识 医生
to siphon your knowledge, doctor.

42
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,990
只打掉激光鸟的一点喷漆而已
Peeled some paint off Laserbeak.

43
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,860
假如我枪法再好点 救护车就不会被劫走了
But if I were a better shot, Ratchet would still be here.

44
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,370
不要气馁 士兵 我们已经检查了整层楼
Chin up, soldier. We've combed the entire floor.

45
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,950
到目前为止 那是我们找到的唯一线索
For the moment, that remains our only clue.

46
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,070
环陆桥记录也毫无用处
Nothing in the groundbridge log.

47
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,670
虽然他们是用环陆桥将人带走的
If they bridged Ratchet out of here

48
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,730
但那是他们的桥 而不是我们的
They used theirs, not ours.

49
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,120
为什么只抓走了救护车 而对他们俩置之不理？
Why take Ratchet prisoner, but leave these two behind?

50
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,200
如果威震天想将我们的医生掳为人质
If Megatron intends to hold our medic hostage

51
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,950
我很奇怪他竟然没有提赎金
I find it curious that he's made no demands.

52
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:54,240
我们有理由相信 救护车手中应该有某种霸天虎想要的东西
It would stand to reason that Ratchet must possess something the Decepticons want.

53
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,130
无论虎子们想要什么 老救是不会给他们的
Well, whatever the 'Cons are after, Ratch won't give it up.

54
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,180
对吧？
Right?

55
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,370
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

56
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,280
我听说您将一个该死的汽车人带到了这艘战舰上
I understand that you have brought an accursed Autobot aboard this warship.

57
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,720
确实如此
Indeed.

58
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,620
那么我和擎天柱没算完的账 就用他结吧
Then I will accomplish with him what I failed to with the Prime.

59
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,040
冲云霄 这名汽车人可不只是俘虏
Predaking, this Autobot is more than a prisoner.

60
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,200
你难道不想修复塞博特恩了么？
You do wish for Cybertron's restoration, do you not?

61
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,690
不过他的价值终会消失
Our captive's usefulness will come to an end.

62
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,050
等到那个时候 我向你保证
And when that time arrives, I assure you

63
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,330
他将任由你处置
he will be all yours.

64
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,570
听着 我需要全天候卫星监控
Listen, I need 24/7 satellite monitoring.

65
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,980
无论是天上飞的 还是地上跑的 都给我盯紧了！
Eyes on the skies and ears to the ground!

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,580
或许铁桶头想得到某个技术玩意
Maybe buckethead's after the techno-babble.

67
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,460
合成能量的配方？
The synth-en formula?

68
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,750
虎子已控制了这星球上几乎所有的能量\N还要合成的玩意儿干什么？
Why would the 'Cons need the artificial stuff If they already control most of this planet's energon reserves?

69
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,440
还能为啥 贪婪呗
Greed, what else?

70
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,850
如果威震天真的如救护车推测的那样
If Megatron is truly rebuilding the Omega Lock

71
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,650
在试图重铸终极之锁
As Ratchet surmised

72
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,400
那么合成能量可能是一种不可或缺的原料
Synthetic energon might be a necessary component.

73
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,410
我不想火上浇油
I hate to be the one to bring lightning to a thunderstorm

74
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,340
但有一件事你们全都忽略了！
But there's one thing we're all ignoring.

75
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,400
如果虎子们在这里抓走了救护车\N那么他们已经知道了这个基地的位置
If the 'Cons found Ratchet here, they know the location of this base.

76
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,960
那么 大脑神经接入器获取了什么信息？
And what did the cortical psychic patch yield?

77
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,000
只确认了合成能量的配方确实不稳定
Only confirmation that the synthetic energon formula Is unstable

78
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,260
并且 汽车人医生对此项目的研究还未完成
and that the Autobot medic's work on it remains incomplete.

79
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,800
看来我们必须帮助救护车完成他的研究
Then it seems we must help Ratchet finish his work.

80
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,890
你在我的脑袋里折腾够了么？
Are you through poking around inside my head?

81
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,810
没找到你想要的东西 是吧？
You didn't find what you wanted, did you?

82
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,720
否则你也不会露面了
Or else you wouldn't be here.

83
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,630
很明显 我想要的东西目前还不存在
What I want apparently does not yet exist.

84
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,340
那东西是…？
And that would be...?

85
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:20,090
我们非常期待你能完成合成能量配方的研究
We would very much like for you to complete your work on the formula for synthetic energon.

86
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,460
就算我能做到 但你觉得我会把用之不竭的能量和弹药拱手相送
Even if I were capable, do you think that I would hand you a limitless supply of fuel and ammunition just

87
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,510
让你拿去对付汽车人吗？
so you can turn around and use it against the Autobots?

88
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,730
哦 你完全误会我们了 亲爱的救护车
Oh, you misunderstand, dearest Ratchet.

89
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,170
我将把这个配方用于创造
I intend to use your formula for the purpose of creation

90
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,300
而非毁灭
Not destruction.

91
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:49,100
我们偶然发现 将你的合成能量与C.N.A.融合
We have fortuitously discovered that your synth-en, when combined with cyber-nucleic acid

92
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,960
是制造一种塞博特恩网状物替代品的基础
May in fact form the basis for an alternative cyber-matter.

93
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,910
你果然是想重铸终极之锁
You are attempting to rebuild the Omega Lock.

94
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,920
只要你我二人向前迈一小步\N就可以创造历史的伟大一刻
We stand on the verge of a great moment in time, you and I.

95
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,590
复苏我们的家园
The restoration of our very homeworld.

96
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,280
通过与你合作？那个毁灭我们家园的罪魁祸首？
Collaborate with the barbarian who essentially destroyed our planet in the first place?

97
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,790
那个面对面残忍地摧毁了大黄蜂发声器的野蛮人？
Who sadistically crushed Bumblebee's voice box while looking him in the eye?

98
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,050
不 谢谢了
No, thank you.

99
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,960
那么你就要做出选择了
Then I present you with a choice:

100
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,140
或者完成你的研究 或者…
Complete your research, or...

101
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,720
哼哼哼 人类永远是你们的弱点
Heh... humans, always the weak link.

102
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,150
你觉得这些人类对我很重要么？
Are these humans supposed to mean something to me?

103
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,700
如果他们不重要的话 我肯定这很重要
If not, I am certain this will.

104
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,760
你一定很清楚
As you must certainly be aware

105
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,940
我们已经掌握了你们基地的位置
We know the location of your current base.

106
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:00,630
乖乖与我合作\N我保证你的汽车人同伙和人类宠物会安然无恙
Accept my offer, and I will allow your fellow Autobots and human pets to remain unharmed.

107
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,430
好好考虑吧 善良的医生
Think it over, good doctor.

108
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,280
我的君王 您不会真的放过那些汽车人吧？
My liege, you aren't really going to allow the Autobots to remain operational?

109
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,300
当然不会
Of course not.

110
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,950
立刻召集你的部队 红蜘蛛
Assemble your armada, Starscream

111
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,500
去再次摧毁他们的基地吧
And decimate their base once again.

112
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,800
唉 所有空中搜索模式都一无所获
All aerial search patterns are coming up empty.

113
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,630
也未拦截到虎子的任何通讯
No comm-link chatter either.

114
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,890
也没有任何地面活动
And no ground activity.

115
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,930
虎子们安静得有点过了
It's a little too quiet out there.

116
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,700
鉴于霸天虎已不再搜索巨狰狞骸骨或地球科技
Since the Decepticons no longer seek Predacon bones or Earth technology

117
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,360
我们已无法追踪任何东西了
there is no activity to track.

118
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,530
那么在威震天有所行动之前 我们只能静观其变了
So until Megatron makes a move, we're in a holding pattern.

119
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,810
救护车觉得他为我造的这只新手并不够好
Ratchet didn't think this new hand he built for me was good enough.

120
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,260
但我告诉你们什么才是真正的不够好
But I'll tell you what truly isn't good enough:

121
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
那就是放弃
Giving up.

122
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,650
我们已别无选择 只能使用一些老办法了
We have no choice but to play this old school

123
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,200
分散成小队搜索 尽可能覆盖最大的范围
Split into teams, for maximum coverage.

124
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,550
敌军来袭！是一整支舰队！
We have incoming. A whole fleet's worth.

125
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,490
集中火力打E机库
Concentrate your fire on hangar E.

126
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,960
空军正在抵挡他们 但只是暂时的
Air cover's holding. For the moment.

127
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,110
威震天陛下 我非常高兴地向您汇报
Lord Megatron, I am pleased to report

128
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,960
汽车人的基地已被夷为平地了
that the Autobot base has been reduced to ashes.

129
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,280
食堂这下成了“屎堂”
The mess hall sure is a mess.

130
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,800
我们很幸运 仅靠简单的伪装就骗过了霸天虎
We are fortunate that Decepticons can be fooled by a simple paint job.

131
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,300
我觉得让你放开手脚 你才有心情去参观我们的设施
I'm sure you would more fully appreciate a tour of our facilities if you were comfortable.

132
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,140
你怎么知道我不会用这些给自己截肢
How do you know I won't use these to amputate?

133
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,220
那你可就没机会欣赏我们的分子伪装力场了
And pass up a chance to see our molecular masking field?

134
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,650
你的隐形装置
Your cloaking device.

135
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,660
不过一个力场而已 没什么技术含量
Shielding is shielding, high tech or low.

136
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,160
或许我们的能量注入电容器能让你刮目相看呢？
Perhaps you'll be more impressed by our energon transfusion capacitor.

137
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,640
它可以让我们的能量消耗上限扩大一千倍
It allows us to maximize our Consumption a thousand-fold.

138
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,420
霸天虎的工程科技 确实令人刮目相看
Decepticon engineering never fails to impress.

139
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,170
医生 虽然我们是死敌
Doctor, we may be mortal enemies

140
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,880
但汽车人与霸天虎却有一个共同的目标
But Autobots and Decepticons do share one common goal.

141
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:08,670
你们应该期盼我们被毁灭的家园恢复昔日的辉煌吧？
You would like to see the ruins of our devastated homeworld restored to their former brilliance

142
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,270
而我也一样
As would I.

143
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,870
威震天 你不过是想再次征服塞博特恩
Megatron, you would just try to conquer Cybertron All over again

144
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,190
并奴役所有拒绝效忠你的人
And enslave anyone who refuses to pledge allegiance to you.

145
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,730
我当然会那么做！
Of course I would!

146
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,020
而你的战友将会一如既往地尝试阻止我
And your comrades would attempt to stop me, as ever.

147
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,720
但至少 我们再次拥有了一颗可以为之战斗的星球
But at least we would once again possess a planet worth fighting over.

148
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,180
或许吧 但你不会满足于此的 是吧？
Perhaps, but you wouldn't stop there, would you?

149
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,340
地球是你的第二个目标 或者是第一个
Earth would be next, if not first.

150
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,560
我如何确定你不会对人类下手
What assurance do I have that you would leave humankind be?

151
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,530
并在你得到想要的东西后将我卸磨杀驴？
And that you wouldn't instantly terminate me once you get what you need?

152
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,980
完全没法确定
None whatsoever.

153
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,830
毕竟你我都心知肚明
After all, we both know that as a Decepticon

154
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,460
我们霸天虎的承诺一钱不值
any assurances I might offer would be worthless.

155
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:11,440
但你或许是塞博特恩重见天日的唯一希望
But that does not change the fact that you may be Cybertron's only hope of ever seeing life again.

156
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:11,440
这一事实不会因此而改变
But that does not change the fact that you may be Cybertron's only hope of ever seeing life again.

157
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,910
这么说 这小子打下了激光鸟应答器的功能终端
So the kid clipped the business end of Laserbeak's transponder.

158
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,730
看来你的枪法还是不错的
You're not such a bad shot after all.

159
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,660
我们就知道 老救不在 你就是分析情报的最佳人选
We thought you might be the best one to provide an analysis

160
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,460
我们就知道 老救不在 你就是分析情报的最佳人选
In Ratchet's absence.

161
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,770
它正在尝试与霸天虎战舰进行通讯
It's trying to communicate with the warship.

162
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,080
你怎么知道的？
How do you know?

163
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,150
它正在告诉我们
It's telling us.

164
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,770
嗯 拉夫 那是塞博特恩代码
Uh, Raf, that's Cybertronian code.

165
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,780
等等 拉夫先是能听懂大黄蜂说话
Wait, first Raf understands Bumblebee

166
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,460
现在又能看懂塞博特恩文字？
Now he reads Cybertronian?

167
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,960
我们确定他不是一个外星人么？
Are we sure he's not some kind of alien?

168
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,900
我已经断断续续学了一段时间了
I've been learning for a while, in between stuff

169
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,610
救护车有空时 就会教我一些
when Ratchet had time to teach me.

170
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,950
嘿 拉夫 我们会把他救回来的
Hey, Raf, we'll bring him back.

171
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,850
哪怕拼上性命
If it's the last thing we do.

172
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,940
如果它正在和它的老妈聊天 我们能否追踪这个信号？
If it's talking to its momma can we triangulate the signal?

173
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,960
追踪一艘被护盾保护着的战舰？
To a shielded warship?

174
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,300
如果这个应答器仍在激光鸟身上\N我们就可以跟踪它
If the transponder were still attached to Laserbeak, We could follow it.

175
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,470
或许我们该给它装副翅膀
Maybe we should give it wings.

176
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,120
我们可以使用加工车间的零配件
We can use spare parts from the machine shop.

177
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,370
那么咱们开工吧 为了大夫
Then let's do it, for the doc.

178
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,630
当你千方百计地夺取我们的资源时
While your forces have put a dent in our resources

179
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,830
震荡波一直在努力升级我们的实验室
Shockwave has been invaluable in updating our laboratory.

180
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,540
如果你答应合作
Should you choose to accept the task

181
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,770
你将可以不受限制地使用我们的设备
You shall have unrestricted access to our equipment.

182
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,350
这居然是量子低温诱导器？
Is that a quantum cryo-inducer?

183
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,630
这东西只建造过两台
Only two were ever made.

184
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,220
事实上 是三台
Three, actually.

185
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,210
你手中的是最初的原型机
You are holding the original prototype.

186
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,440
频率调节器总是短路！
The frequency modulator keeps shorting out!

187
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,980
放松点 孩子 我去检查一下电线
Easy, champ. Let me try uncrossing some wires.

188
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,380
这情景可真少见
Now there's something you don't see every day.

189
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,720
老千从前并不是个独行侠
Ie wasn't always a loner, you know.

190
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,460
作为雷霆救援队员 队伍永远是第一位的
Being a Wrecker was all about the team.

191
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,290
别 别 别！
Yip-ip-ip-ip!

192
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,560
神子！那个我还有用呐！
Miko! I needed that!

193
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,330
我只是想弄紧那个什么玩意
I was just trying to tighten up that thingamajig.

194
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,340
切！拉倒吧！
Pfff! Please!

195
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,000
福勒探员
Agent fowler.

196
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,730
你没事吧？
Everything all right?

197
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,270
就是有点心事
Just preoccupied.

198
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,810
我在想最近我们从虎子手中死里逃生的情景
Thinking about the close calls We humans have had with the 'Cons lately.

199
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,180
被声波打倒在地 和你妈妈一起被关在击倒的后备箱里
Smacked down by Soundwave, stuck in Knock out's trunk with your mom.

200
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,460
这个就甭提了
Moving on...

201
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,480
让人忧心的是
the uncomfortable reality is

202
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,630
汽车人不会一直留在这里
The 'bots might not always be here.

203
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,620
即使他们在 他们也不能同时出现在所有地方
And even if they are, they can't be everywhere at once

204
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,740
我们已经有过教训
as we've learned.

205
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,150
这副盔甲是当时唯一能保护神子免遭巨狰狞毒手的东西
This armor is the only thing that stood between Miko and that Predacon.

206
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,590
正是因为它 神子才能毫发无伤
The reason she came back without a scratch.

207
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,100
这类塞博特恩科技可能正是我们需要的
Cyber-tech like that could be just what we need

208
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,120
使我们前线的探员 在面对强敌时获得一线生机
To give our agents on the front lines a fighting chance.

209
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,370
将来 你也很可能成为其中的一员
Agents like, maybe you someday.

210
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,390
我？！
What?!

211
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,900
你很快就够年龄了 而且你是个领袖坯子 孩子
You'll be of age soon, and you're Prime material, son.

212
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,110
你妈妈觉得你很适合这项工作
Your mom thought you might be a good fit

213
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,550
鉴于你目前对自己的未来毫无打算
seeing as you've been wishy-washy about future plans.

214
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,270
等等 你经常和我妈妈聊天？聊我的事？
Wait, you've been talking to my mom? About me?

215
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,470
卡斯特的胡子！
Custer's mustache!

216
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,470
（Custer 卡斯特 美国南北战争时期的将军\N以不怕死著称 由于部下伤亡过大 不太受官兵拥戴）
Custer's mustache!

217
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,820
抱歉 福勒探员
Sorry, Agent Fowler.

218
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,290
看来我得换条星条旗短裤了
I think I need to change my star-spangled shorts.

219
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,940
我仍在调校芯片的遥控功能
I'm still fine-tuning chip's remote.

220
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,880
芯片？
Chip?

221
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,160
也就是说 我们要让这个小玩意飞回虎子的指挥中心
So we're gonna let this doohickey fly back to 'con central...

222
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,150
并给我们指明救护车的位置
And lead us right to Ratchet.

223
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,940
即使你能重铸终极之锁
Even if you manage to reconstruct the Omega Lock

224
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,320
但很久以前我就意识到 它是一种神秘的力量
It is a mystic force. I've come to my senses.

225
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,080
使用技术复制其能力是完全不可能的
The notion of scientifically replicating its capability Is pure folly.

226
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,600
甚至可以称为痴心妄想！
Madness, even.

227
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:14,690
但医生 如果我们不去尝试 如何确定这不可行呢？
But how will we ever know for certain, doctor... if we do not try?

228
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,590
而当万事俱备之际 我们何不放手一试呢？
And how can we not try, When the means finally lie within our reach?

229
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,120
火种源在上
By the Allspark

230
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,220
你真的成功了
you've actually done it.

231
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,500
拜霸天虎工程技术所赐
Decepticon engineering.

232
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,120
用不了多久 终极之锁就可以全力运作了
It will not take long for this Omega Lock's drives to be fully operational.

233
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,580
那么复苏我们家园所唯一欠缺的
All that is still needed to restore our home

234
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,870
就是它所产生的塞博特恩网状物
is the cyber-matter to launch through it.

235
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,930
这需要一个稳定的配方来生产合成能量
Which requires a stabilized formula for the production of synthetic energon.

236
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,730
我对你完全有信心 医生
I have every confidence in you, doctor.

237
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
我答应你
I'll do it.

238
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,820
而这早就在你的预料之中 是不是？
But then you already knew that, didn't you?
