1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,060
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,860
既然我能统治两个世界…
Why rule only one world when I can rule two?

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,360
威震天已经完成了数字化地球的第一阶段
Megatron has managed to accomplish the first phase of his cyberforming of Earth...

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,260
建造他的堡垒
the construction of his fortress.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,760
在贾斯帕 内华达？
In Jasper, Nevada?

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,860
我不明白 他们干嘛要建在这儿？
I don't get it. Why here?

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,860
因为霸天虎已经发现了我们基地的位置
Because the Decepticons have discovered the location of our base.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,560
上吧 我的舰队！进攻！
Come, my armada, attack!

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,860
基地已经沦陷了
The base is lost.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,560
我们只有分散开才能成功突围
We must disperse to avoid capture.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,060
特工福勒呼叫防空指挥部
Special Agent Fowler to Air Defense Command.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,360
我需要紧急战斗支援
I need immediate combat support.

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,660
不！
No.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,160
进行地毯式搜索！
Leave no stone unturned.

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,160
主人 看看我们找到了什么
Master, look who we found

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,360
从飞船残骸中抓到的雷霆救援队员
pulled from the wreckage of his ship...

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,860
千斤顶
Wheeljack.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,660
这么说 有一个死里逃生了
So, one survived.

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,660
把我们的“贵客”带回大本营候审 带他回黑山
Take our guest back to the citadel for questioning. Back to Darkmount.

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,660
新时代的序幕已经拉开 我的君王
This is the dawning of a new age, my liege...

21
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,360
威震天的王朝开始了
the reign of Megatron.

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,760
你很能说会道啊 红蜘蛛
You do have a way with words, Starscream.

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,860
快点
Make haste and unearth the Autobot corpses.

24
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,060
卓天越之锤？
The forge of Solus Prime?!

25
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,860
你们有本事找得到这个
How is it that you have managed to materialize that

26
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,060
却搜不出一具汽车人的残骸？！
yet not the remains of a single Autobot?!

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,560
快回答主人的话
Answer your Lord and master.

28
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,260
他们的尸体在哪里？！
Where are their bodies?!

29
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
你伤得重吗？
You're hurt

30
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,460
但你看上去要比你的实际情况还要糟
but you probably look way worse than you feel.

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,960
不 别动也别说话
No, don't move or talk.

32
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,860
保存力量 恢复体力
Just power down. Get your strength back.

33
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,460
我会保护你的
I got you covered.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,760
显然汽车人在我们摧毁基地前就利用环陆桥逃走了
The Autobots clearly ground bridged from their base before it was destroyed.

35
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,960
他们现在可能在任何地方
They could be anywhere.

36
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,060
我们必须启用全球监控 我的陛下
We must initiate global surveillance, my Lord.

37
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,860
派遣清理小队 查遍地球的每个角落
Send search-and-destroy teams to every sector of this planet.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,160
声波 监控所有汽车人的信号传输
Soundwave, monitor all Earth-based transmissions for any sign of Autobot communication...

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,260
或是与其人类盟友之间的通讯信号
with each other or with their human counterparts.

40
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,660
主人…
Master...

41
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,060
愚蠢的人类…
Mm. Foolish humans.

42
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,460
我去部署大军
I shall deploy the armada.

43
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
没这个必要 红蜘蛛
That won't be necessary, Starscream

44
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,060
何不让敌人尝尝我们的新力量！
not when we can engage our enemy with newfound might.

45
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
一个新政权统治了你们的世界
A new power dominates your world.

46
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,460
任何针对我的进一步挑衅行为 我都会加倍奉还！
Any further attempts to attack me will be met with even greater force.

47
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,460
你们的领导人最好明白
Your leaders should be advised

48
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:16,560
我的融合炮能轻易摧毁任意一个密集居民区
that my fusion cannons possess enough firepower to decimate any densely populated area of my choosing.

49
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,960
我十有八九 会先拿你们的首都开刀
I would, in all likelihood, set sights on your nation's capital, for starters.

50
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,260
明白了 你到底想要什么？
Point taken. Now, what do you want from us?

51
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,360
我什么都不要 福勒特工
Nothing, Agent Fowler.

52
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,060
霸天虎对人类没有恶意
The Decepticons mean no harm to humanity.

53
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,160
我们只是渴望能有个栖身之所
We merely desire a place to call home.

54
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
威震天 我无意冒犯
No offense, Megatron, but I'm having a tough time

55
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,760
但我很难相信你的话
swallowing all this...

56
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,460
因为你一心想把人类置于你的魔爪之下！
Since you seem so bent on plastering humankind under molten steel.

57
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,460
福勒特工 我承认战争将我最坏的一面展露无遗
Agent Fowler... I admit that war brings out the worst in me

58
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,460
但我们与汽车人之间的战争已经就此了结
but the conflict with the Autobots is now over

59
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
而且我们与人类之间并无瓜葛
and our quarrel has never been with your kind.

60
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,360
既然霸天虎的真正敌人已经不复存在
Now that the one, true enemy of the Decepticons is no more

61
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,660
我唯一的愿望就是能在这个星球上与人类…和平共处
my only wish is to coexist on this planet with the human race, peacefully.

62
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,460
福勒特工 你我携手
Together, Agent Fowler

63
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,260
这梦想定能成真
I believe that you and I can make that dream a reality.

64
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,260
您也蛮会忽悠的啊 主人
You, too, have a way with words, master.

65
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,260
连我都差点儿相信您了
I almost believed you myself.

66
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,260
地球现在归我们了 红蜘蛛
Earth is our planet now, Starscream

67
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,660
是时候收锣罢鼓了
and we shall finish what we started.

68
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,160
人类绝对想不到在谎言的背后…
Humankind has no idea

69
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,060
等待他们的将是什么
what lies ahead for them.

70
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,360
是的 布莱斯将军
Yes, General Bryce.

71
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,760
特别应急方案G-1000已照计划执行
Special containment protocol G-1000 has been executed as planned.

72
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,360
内华达贾斯帕的疏散行动非常成功
Evacuation of Jasper, Nevada, was 100% successful.

73
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,860
对市民和媒体公布的说辞 是流星雨导致的灾难
As far as its citizens or the media are concerned, the threat was a meteor shower

74
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
在其造成的辐射消退前 城镇将持续封锁…
and the town is to remain quarantined until the resulting radiation levels can be dissipated.

75
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,260
长官 任何形式的反击都过于冒险了！
Sir, any form of retaliation would be too risky.

76
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,860
我需要更多的时间！
I just need more time.

77
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,860
好 我明白了…
Yes, I understand.

78
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,360
福勒探员
Agent Fowler

79
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,960
那些医疗物资仍然没有到位 我们有伤员急需…
those medical supplies still haven't arrived. We have wounded men who need...

80
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,160
我已经竭尽全力了 达比护士
doing the best I can, nurse Darby.

81
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,160
我一直忙于应付那群刚上任 一心只想把事闹大的将军们
I've been a little busy juggling a bunch of nuke-happy generals who don't seem to care if they blow Nevada sky-high

82
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,660
还有那个假意向我们示好的霸天虎暴君
and a Decepticon warlord who wants to make nice

83
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,560
只因为汽车人都进了废铁场
now that the Autobots are in the scrapyard...

84
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
当然那是威震天的想法 不是我的
Megatron's opinion, not mine.

85
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,960
他对我说了一堆屁话 妄图击垮我们的意志
He's feeding me a load of horse pucky, trying to crush our spirit.

86
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,760
还是没有任何人的消息？
Still no word from anyone?

87
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,760
听我说
Listen

88
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,360
没有消息只能表示核心通讯器在基地被炸平时毁坏了
no contact only tells me that the main comm link went down when the base was pounded into pancake batter.

89
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,360
但是如果我给杰克打个电话…
But if I could just call Jack...

90
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,360
你知道这样做有多危险 汽车人也一样
You know it's too risky. So do the bots.

91
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,860
虎子们可以监测任何手机信号
The Cons could trace any cellphone signal.

92
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,460
那就带我回家
Then take me home.

93
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,260
如果杰克联系不上我 他一定会去那里找我
If Jack can't call, that's where he'll look for me.

94
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,260
贾斯帕已经被虎子彻底封锁 谁都回不去了
Jasper's under complete comm lockdown. Nobody's getting back in there.

95
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
只有擎天柱还有他的汽车人能解决这场危机
The only ones who can fix this mess are Prime and his bots.

96
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,760
我敢肯定他们就在某处
I'm sure they're out there

97
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,660
低调行事
keeping a low profile.

98
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,860
一定是这样的！
They got to be.

99
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
扫描中…
Scanning.

100
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,660
非预期结果…无汽车人身份识别
Negative. No Autobot recognition.

101
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,960
走了！
Clear.

102
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,760
好险 不过你的喷漆蒙混过关了！
Too close. But your paint job did the trick.

103
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
看来子通讯链还没有恢复
The comm sub link is still down.

104
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,160
小蜂
Bee

105
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,660
我明白擎天柱为避免虎子抓到我们 将我们分别传送到不同地点
I realize Optimus sent us all to different locations to make us harder for the Cons to find

106
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,460
但如果我们不知道其他人的位置
but if we don't know where in the world anyone else went

107
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,060
该怎么找到他们呢？！
how are we gonna find them?

108
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,660
你说得对 我们只能继续向贾斯帕前进
Right. Just keep heading toward Jasper...

109
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,760
前往威震天巨大的堡垒
toward Megatron's giant fortress.

110
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,160
从没想到路会这么难走
I never knew there were so many rockies.

111
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,060
神子！
Miko!

112
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,060
不许用手机 你知道规矩的！
No cellphone! You know the rules.

113
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,760
哥们儿 我没给任何人打电话
Dude, I wasn't calling anyone

114
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,560
只是在玩我下好了的游戏
just playing a video game I already downloaded.

115
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
对不起 我想我有点儿过于紧张了
Sorry. I guess I'm a little on edge.

116
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,260
我们这是去哪儿 小隔？
Where are we headed anyway, Bulk?

117
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,860
你有什么计划吗？
You got some sort of plan?

118
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,260
我们正按雷霆救援队的标准方案行动
We're following standard Wrecker protocol.

119
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,960
方案是…？
Which is...

120
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,260
这是我们在大战时制定的紧急计划
An emergency plan we followed during the war

121
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
如果一位雷霆救援队员被困或是掉队
in case any Wrecker got standard or separated from the unit.

122
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,260
我们总是会在特定地点会合
We'd always rendezvous at the exact same set of coordinates.

123
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,360
老千肯定还活着 他会去那里的！
If Jack is still alive, he'll be there.

124
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,960
别停啊
Don't stop now.

125
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,060
我才刚开始享受呢！
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

126
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,460
相信我 千斤顶
Believe me, Wheeljack

127
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,060
还有得你受的！
there is more where that came from.

128
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,260
我保证你会乖乖告诉我你同伙的藏身之地
And you will tell me the location of your compatriots...

129
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,360
用什么手段 花多长时间
... no matter what it takes

130
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,760
我都无所谓…
... or how long.

131
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,360
不是说了吗
Like I told you

132
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,260
他们并没有在等我
they weren't expecting me.

133
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,860
也根本没告诉我任何信息
They never bothered to fill me in.

134
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
所以你只管继续
So, go ahead.

135
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
尽管折腾好了…
Knock yourself out.

136
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,260
威震天陛下 有什么能为您效劳的吗？
How may I serve you, Lord Megatron?

137
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,760
集结一支队伍 立刻飞往塞博特恩
Assemble a team and disembark for Cybertron immediately.

138
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,060
以追捕汽车人为首要任务 同时
While hunting Autobots remains paramount

139
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,560
借此机会 找回在混乱中遗弃在铁堡的遗物
we must not squander the opportunity to recover any Iacon relics left behind in the chaos.

140
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,260
据我们所知
For all we know

141
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,160
擎天柱正躲在某处
Optimus Prime is out there somewhere

142
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,960
谋划着同样的事情…
planning to do the same.

143
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,360
没事了 擎天柱
I-It's okay, Optimus.

144
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,160
我就在你身边 我是烟幕
You're with me... Smokescreen.

145
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,960
我怎么在这里？
How did... I get here?

146
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,560
在我们从基地撤离时 也就是虎子开炮那会儿
When we were evacuating the base, just as the Cons opened fire...

147
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,160
本该轮到我撤离的
It was my turn to ground bridge away.

148
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
但我做不到
But I couldn't do it.

149
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,560
我不能让你独自面对威震天的大军
I couldn't let you face Megatron's army alone.

150
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,360
于是我偷偷溜了回来
So, I snuck back.

151
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,960
但基地遭到了攻击
But that's when the blast hit

152
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,060
已经完全坍塌了
and the whole joint came tumbling down.

153
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,460
我设法在虎子来之前利用相位仪把您从废墟中救了出来
But I managed to pull you from the wreckage before the Cons dove in, using the Phase Shifter

154
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,860
相位仪是我…在塞博特恩还是一片混乱中抢回来的
which I... managed to snag in all the confusion back on Cybertron.

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,960
呃 很抱歉 我违抗了您的命令…
I'm... I'm sorry I defied your orders.

156
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
我们在这里很安全
We're safe here

157
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,060
但是我们身处地下 没人能收到我们的信号
but we're down so deep, no one can pick up our signals.

158
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,360
如果我们想找到救护车的话 得去地面
I'll have to scout above ground if I'm gonna have any hope of finding Ratchet.

159
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,360
没…没用的
No. No hope.

160
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
什么意思？
What do you mean?

161
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,960
救护车是唯一能医好你的人！
The Doc's the only one who can get you patched up.

162
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
擎天柱…
Optimus.

163
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,660
如果贾斯帕没有被及时疏散
What if Jasper wasn't evacuated in time?

164
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,860
妈妈她可能会受伤
She could have been hurt

165
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,460
或者被虎子抓走
or taken by the Cons.

166
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,260
杰克
Jack...

167
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,660
就算她逃出来了
And even if she did get out

168
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,460
没有我的消息 她也肯定急疯了
she's got to be worried out of her mind not knowing where I am.

169
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,060
杰克 冷静点儿
Jack, calm down.

170
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,860
我们会回到贾斯帕的
We'll get back to Jasper

171
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,660
想办法找到你妈妈
find a way to reach your mother

172
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,160
还有其他队员
and the rest of the team.

173
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,260
留在这儿
Stay here.

174
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,960
可能有虎子跟踪我们
Could be a Con on our tail.

175
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,160
对不起 妈妈
Sorry, mom.

176
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,760
如果情况允许 我一定会打给你的
I'd call if I could.

177
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,760
一条短信应该不会有事吧？
Oh, one text couldn't hurt, could it?

178
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,160
主人！
Master.

179
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,360
派出部队
Send in the troops.

180
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,360
另外 声波
And, Soundwave

181
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
为我实时传输现场情况！
I want a live feed.

182
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,160
杰克！
Jack.

183
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,060
“我和阿尔茜在一起 很安全 爱你！”
"With Arcee. Safe. Love you."

184
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
福勒探员 杰克还活着！
Agent Fowler, Jack's alive!

185
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,760
糟了！
Scrap.

186
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
喔 虚惊一场
Oh... Civilian.

187
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,460
杰克！
Jack!

188
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,060
这下我完蛋了！
I am so toast.

189
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
杰克 笑一个
Smile, Jack.

190
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,660
你上霸天虎电视节目了！
You're on Decepticon TV.

191
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,060
主人 我们收到画面了
Master. We have a visual.

192
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,160
到底要多久才能干掉一个汽车人和她的人类宠物！
How long does it take to exterminate a lone Autobot and her human pet?!

193
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,160
这个嘛 依我的经验…
Well, in my experience...

194
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,460
我的话不是疑问句 红蜘蛛！
It's not a riddle, Starscream.

195
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,060
抱歉…
Sorry.

196
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,660
那里！
Over there.

197
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,660
这儿可不是藏身的好地方
Not the best cover.

198
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,160
我们不是来藏身的…
We're not here to hide.

199
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,160
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

200
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,960
加点儿汽油还是柴油啊？
Unleaded or diesel?

201
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
赶在他们派援军到达之前 快撤！
Let's roll before they send reinforcements.

202
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,460
伙计们 加把劲 不要偷懒！
Come on, fellas. Put your backs into it.

203
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,860
精锐护甲
The Apex armor.

204
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,860
我们的伟大领袖会很高兴的
Our illustrious leader will be pleased.

205
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,460
仍然没有相位仪的下落吗？
Now, any sign of that Phase Shifter?

206
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,760
我真心喜欢那东西
I really liked that thing.

207
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,560
长官！
Sir.

208
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,760
我的火种源啊…
By the Allspark.

209
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,060
怎么样 还有监控资料留存吗？
Well? Did any of the surveillance data survive?

210
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
唉 可惜了
Eh... A shame.

211
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,860
我们本应至少得到阿尔茜和那个人类的逃跑方向…
We might have at least learned the direction in which Arcee and the human fled.

212
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,460
显然我们要改进追捕汽车人的方法
Clearly, we need to improve our methods of hunting Autobots

213
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,960
并巩固我们已经获得的战术优势
and build upon the tactical advantage that we've managed to secure.

214
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,160
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

215
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,560
我已准备好返回黑山
I am ready to return to Darkmount

216
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,160
而且我敢肯定您看见我的发现后 一定会龙颜大悦的
and I'm certain you'll want to see what I've uncovered.

217
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,760
声波 开启太空桥！
Soundwave, open a space-bridge portal.

218
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,960
我现在迫切需要一个好消息
I find myself in urgent need of good news

219
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
所以 击倒
so please, Knockout

220
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,260
拜托你告诉我 找到了什么有用的宝贝
tell me that you found something useful.

221
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,060
有一些东西 我的君王
Some things, my liege.

222
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,860
还有…某个人！
And someone.

223
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,960
他还…活着！
He... lives?

224
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,860
震荡波！
Shockwave.

225
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,660
这正是我所需要的战术优势啊！
Just the tactical advantage I need.
