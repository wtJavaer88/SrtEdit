1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,740
环陆桥连接申请…来自苏格兰
Incoming groundbridge request... from Scotland.

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,790
千斤顶 出什么事了？
Wheeljack, what happened?

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,750
其他人在哪儿？
Where are the others?

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,530
在通天晓的飞船里享受长途旅行呢 我敢肯定
Having a swell time taking the long way home in Ultra Magnus' boat, I'm sure.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,070
包括神子在内
Miko included.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,870
难怪她买瓶汽水需要这么久
I wondered what was taking so long with those sodas.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
你拿到巨狰狞的骸骨了吗？
Did you secure the Predacon bone?

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,930
这个…狩猎者们内讧了 大夫
The Beast Hunt kind of imploded, Doc.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,900
我刚刚又收到了一条虎子活动的消息 就在新墨西哥洲的陶斯城外
Well, I just got wind of another 'Con hotspot. Right outside of Taos, New Mexico.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,190
鉴于擎天柱的小分队还没从产油国回来…
Since Prime's unit isn't back from oil country...

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,920
拉夫 把环陆桥指向福勒探员提供的坐标
Raf, set a bridge for Fowler's coordinates.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,000
你 跟我来
You, roll with me.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,540
不去行不？
Not today, all right?

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,000
如果你放心我独自前往 那不去也罢
If you're all right sending me out there alone.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,630
我就喜欢独来独往
Alone's how I prefer to roll.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,220
千斤顶 你要让我放下手头的繁重工作 去外面冒险吗？
Wheeljack, you do not want to make me abandon a complex equation to venture outside my comfort zone.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,200
呃 好吧
Huh... Fine...

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,310
但要事先声明一下
But in case you haven't figured it out...

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,850
跟别人合作不是我的菜
I don't play well with others.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,130
该死！
Scrap.

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,680
知道我最喜欢车型杂兵们哪一点吗？
Know what I love most about Vehicon troopers?

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,290
他们很容易走神
They're easily distracted.

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,660
走你！
Ya!

24
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,080
哈！
Ha!

25
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,150
喝！
Huh!

26
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,360
你确定你不是救援队的？
You sure you weren't a Wrecker?

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
你确定合作不是你的菜？
You sure you don't play well with others?

28
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,880
打得漂亮 杰克！
Nice shooting, Tex.

29
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,880
嗨 妈妈 有事吗？
Hey, Mom, what's up?

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,410
达比护士
Nurse Darby

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,940
什么风把你给吹来了？
what brings you here?

32
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,480
你向我们慷慨捐赠的医药物资
The medical supplies you so graciously offered to donate

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,090
杰克总是忘记带回家
that Jack keeps forgetting to bring home.

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,490
医院十分感激你的慷慨相助 福勒探员
The hospital appreciates your generosity, Agent Fowler.

35
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,270
叫我威廉就行了
Please, call me William.

36
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,930
伙计们 我在一个博物馆里找到了巨狰狞的爪子
Guys, I found a Predacon talon... in a museum.

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,040
它1922年出土的时候让科学家们大伤脑筋 所以一直被收在仓库里
Scientists were totally stumped when they excavated it in 1922, so it's been in storage.

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,230
但我们的野兽猎人都被派出去了
But we're fresh out of Beast Hunters.

39
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,090
好吧…我选择急救车辆为变形模式 可不是白给的
Heh... I didn't choose "emergency" as my vehicle mode for laughs.

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,440
不一定非得汽车人出马嘛
Not sure you need a 'Bot.

41
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,810
或许你们应该等擎天柱回来
Maybe you should all just wait for Optimus.

42
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,750
请注意 达比护士
I'll have you known, nurse Darby.

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,840
在擎天柱出现前 我可是当了30年游骑兵和联邦特工的
I was an army Ranger and federal Agent for Unit-E three decades before I'd ever heard the name Optimus Prime.

44
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,890
这类零风险公务对我来说小菜一碟
I'm more than equipped to handle a milk run.

45
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,120
其实 你也可以一起来的
In fact, why don't you tag along?

46
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,290
哦 这不太好吧
Oh, I don't know about that.

47
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,500
哦 绝对不行
Oh, a... absolutely not.

48
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,400
妈妈 我可不想让你跟虎子有任何接触 这不…
Mom, I don't want you anywhere near anything 'Con. It's not...

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,850
安全？我未成年的儿子真的想告诉我\N他可以开心地跑去塞博特恩
Safe? Is my teenage son seriously going to tell me that its fine for him to travel all the way to Cybertron

50
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,070
而他的老妈却不能参加那个…那个…
but his mother can't be trusted to go on a... on a...

51
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,000
零风险公务
Milk run.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,450
零风险公务？
A milk run?

53
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,090
不 我…我…你不是有乳糖不耐症吗？而我…
No, I... it's just... you're lactose intolerant, and I...

54
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,740
我们走 福勒探员
Come on, Agent Fowler.

55
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,530
啊 干得漂亮 我的爱宠
Ah, you performed well, my pet.

56
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,370
这将对巨狰狞队伍的壮大做出巨大的贡献
This will be a splendid contribution to the spawning of your Predacon brethren.

57
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,250
我的君王 我们找到了另一处\N震荡波的巨狰狞能量信号 微弱但很稳定
My liege, we've located another of Shockwave's Predacon energy signatures. Weak, but steady.

58
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,940
好极了！
Excellent.

59
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,480
击倒 不要空手回来见我
Knockout, do not return empty-handed.

60
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,360
我？我的字典里没有这个字
Me? Don't know the meaning of the word.

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,380
空手不是两个字吗？
Isn't "empty-handed" two words?

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,080
瞧你能耐的 找回丢失的装甲了吗？
You would know, or did your missing armor turn up?

63
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,170
你这只会在地上爬的…
Why, you wheel-bound...

64
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,800
红蜘蛛 你今天已经够让我失望的了
Starscream! You have failed me enough for one day.

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,950
回去继续搜索其他巨狰狞的能量信号 赶快！
Assume the task of monitoring for Predacon energy signatures, at once!

66
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,630
是 我的君王
Yes, my liege.

67
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,800
你肯定会像我一样发现这份\N工作能让你神清气爽 小红同学
I'm sure you'll find the gig as invigorating as I did, "Screamer".

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,220
啊…
Ah...

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,040
震荡波已经开始用目前采集到的标本进行克隆了
Shockwave has initiated the cloning process with the specimens gathered thus far.

70
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,230
这只巨狰狞 只不过是新一波超级野兽机器战士中的先锋而已
The Predacon currently among us will be but the first of a new wave of beast machine super-soldiers.

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,270
你在这里晃荡什么？
What are you lurking about for?

72
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,790
滚回你的狗窝去！
Get back to your kennel.

73
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,570
啊！
Ah!

74
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,690
呃！
Um!

75
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,660
啊！你这没脑子的畜牲 瞧你干得好事！
Ah! You mindless brute, look what you've done!

76
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,730
你很安静啊 千斤顶
You're awfully quiet, Wheeljack.

77
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,050
我向来不喜欢闲聊
I've never been one for chitchat.

78
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,280
你为什么要假装呢？
Why do you pretend?

79
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,880
如果你真想单干 今天早就闪人了 但是你没有
If you really wanted to roll alone, you would've hit the open road today. But you didn't.

80
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,930
你乘坐环陆桥返回了基地
You called for a 'bridge back to base.

81
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,260
嘿！别自作聪明了
Hey. Don't assume you know me.

82
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,560
我没有
I'm not assuming.

83
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,250
现在 可以聊聊到底发生了什么事吗？
Now, care to chitchat about what happened out there?

84
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,340
我怎么说来着 零风险公务
What did I tell you? Milk run.

85
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,460
是啊 就是那家伙的脾气有点古怪
With one cranky cow.

86
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:57,890
馆长？好像他看管的是蒙娜丽莎\N而不是从哈丁时期就被尘封的史前螺母似的
The curator? Acted like he was guarding the Mona Lisa, instead of some prehistoric lug nut that's been gathering dust since Harding was president.

87
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,950
我得说 福勒探员 你处理得当
I have to say, Agent Fowler, you handled him well.

88
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,550
我很钦佩
I was quite impressed.

89
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,090
达比护士 依我说你比我前妻要更为出色
Nurse Darby, I'd say that puts you one step ahead of my ex.

90
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,180
嗯 离婚了 是吧？
Hmm. Divorced, huh?

91
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,750
啊…是的 你呢？
Ah... Yeah. What about you?

92
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,050
和达比先生之间有什么故事？
What's the story with Mr. Darby?

93
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,400
嗯…说起来更像是个传奇故事
Ah... More like a saga

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,620
不过…你肯定听过类似的
but one I'm sure you've heard before.

95
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,550
我是来帮你们两个鸡蛋挑骨头的
I have a bone to pick with both of you.

96
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,190
快跑！
Run!

97
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,260
平静 放松 欣赏下风景吧！
Kick back, relax, and enjoy the scenery.

98
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,110
击倒呼叫威震天陛下！
Knockout to Lord Megatron.

99
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,780
古代巨狰狞的爪子已经到手 附赠两个汽车人的宠物
I have secured one vintage Predacon talon, plus two of the Autobots' pets

100
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,080
您拿去当人质也好 做实验也罢 总之随您的便
for you to employ as hostages, lab experiments, well anyway you see fit

101
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,170
所以赶紧地 老大 说您爱人家胜过红蜘蛛
so go on, Big M, tell me you love me more than Starscream.

102
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,320
君王？呃…我太放肆了？
My liege? Hello? Too familiar?

103
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,830
这只原始的杂种狗破坏了我们整个通讯网络
The primitive mutt demolishes our entire communications network

104
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,420
而威震天陛下还打算要繁殖更多的？
and lord Megatron intends to breed more of it?

105
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:37,050
你们俩能快点吗？\N要在我们的主人为这些小事伤脑筋之前修好它
Would you two hurry? I want this fixed before our Master is bothered by such distracting minutiae.

106
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,210
现在重置访问代码并重启…
Entering access override code and rebooting now.

107
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,350
啊！不 不不不不不不！
Ah! No! No, no, no, no...!

108
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,790
他们去了有好一阵了
It's really taking them a while.

109
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,490
阿尔茜和千斤顶？
Arcee and Wheeljack?

110
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,990
我妈妈和福勒探员
My Mom and Agent Fowler.

111
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,020
嗯 也许他们在途中共进晚餐呢
Hum... Maybe they stopped for dinner.

112
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,120
大人拍拖时不就是这样吗？
Isn't that what grown-ups do when they're dating?

113
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,790
大人们是因为饿才这么做！
It's what grown-ups do when they're hungry.

114
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,400
- 妈妈？\N- 再猜 兔小子杰克！
- Mom.\N- Guess again, Jack rabbit.

115
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,300
我希望你现在不渴了 因为我带回来的东西可比饮料酷多了！
and I hope you're not still thirsty because I'm bringing back something way cooler that sodas.

116
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,010
我现在不能聊天 神子 我在等电话
I can't talk, Miko. I need to leave this line free.

117
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,660
等下 先别挂 千斤顶回去了吗？
Wait, don't hang up. Did Wheeljack show?

118
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,460
我想隔板很担心他
I think Bulkhead's really worried about him.

119
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,790
千斤顶没事 他跟阿尔茜执行任务去了
Wheeljack is fine. He's on a mission with Arcee.

120
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,350
千斤顶已经有新搭档了？太无情了！
Wheeljack's riding with a new partner already? That's cold.

121
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,060
什么？不 就是一个任务而已 不是搭档关系
What? No. It's just one mission, they're not partners.

122
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,580
哈哈 我一直在猜这两位独行侠什么时候能来电
Haha. I wondered how long it would take our two lone wolves to hook up.

123
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,110
我都说了我们应该等擎天柱
I told you we should have waited for Optimus.

124
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,710
到底还是说了 “我不是跟你说过了吗”
There it is. The "I told you so."

125
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,780
反正 我不买账 这个虎子就守在博物馆那儿
Well, no sale, sister. The 'Con was at the museum.

126
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,380
如果我们等的话 在擎天柱到达之前他就把爪子抢到手了
If we had waited, he would have snagged the talon before Prime got there.

127
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,930
就我们现在所处的局面 那又有什么不同？
And given our current situation, what difference would that have made?

128
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,470
喂！你们两个拍拖有多久了？\N这吵起架来就跟老夫老妻似的
Hello? How long have you two been dating? Because you bicker like an old married couple.

129
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,090
什么？
What?

130
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,110
我们没拍拖
We're not dating.

131
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,930
说老实话 我觉得那很恶心唉！
Frankly, I find it repulsive

132
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,400
你们这些肉虫…结合的整个概念都…妈呀哎
the whole idea of you fleshies... interfacing...[shivers]

133
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,500
击倒呼叫基地 再次请求 接我回家！
Knockout to base, requesting pick up, again...

134
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,280
好吧 到底有没有人在听啊？
All right, is anyone up there receiving me?!

135
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,700
达比护士 琼
Nurse Darby. June.

136
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,420
如果这个虎子把我们带到威震天的老窝 汽车人找到我们的机率
If this 'Con gets us to Megatron's warship, the chances of the 'bots ever finding us

137
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
恐怕连千分之一都不到
decrease a thousand fold.

138
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,840
永远不要让霸天虎把你带到别处去
Never let a Decepticon take you to a second location.

139
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,760
在博物馆那儿我被缴了械 你有没有可以当作武器的东西？
He disarmed me back at the museum. Do you have anything we could use as a weapon?

140
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,160
胡椒粉喷雾剂？
Pepper spray?

141
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,370
喷虎子？
On a 'Bot?

142
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,290
像通天晓那样的家伙
Guys like 'Magnus...

143
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,520
烦不到我头上 只有我烦他们的份儿
I don't let them peel my paint. I peel theirs.

144
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,510
所以让你恼火的不是新指挥官 而是隔板
So if it isn't the new Commander who's grinding your gears, it's Bulkhead.

145
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,230
呃…看到一个雷霆救援队员变得畏首畏尾 很是让人恼火
Hum... Just burns me up when a Wrecker goes soft.

146
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,700
听着 千斤顶 在你心中雷霆救援队永远都是老样子
Look, Wheeljack. You'll always have the Wreckers as you knew them, in here.

147
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,230
时代在变化
Times change

148
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,330
铁打的营盘流水的兵 如果你不能适应 便无法生存
players come and go, and if you can't adapt, you'll rust

149
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,430
就像我们正在挖的骨头一样
like the bones we're digging for.

150
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,620
别跟隔板疏远了 如果他出了事 你永远都不会原谅自己的
Don't push Bulkhead away. If something happened to him, you'd never forgive yourself.

151
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,490
相信我 我深有体会
Trust me, I know.

152
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,440
击倒呼叫基地 请求环陆桥 第N次呼叫了
Knockout to base, requesting groundbridge for the umpteenth time.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,700
基地 请回复
Come in, base.

154
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,690
啊 人家不能开一夜的车…
Ohh. I can't drive around all night...

155
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,950
…怎么？
- what?\N- Oh!

156
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,520
注意轮圈！
Watch the rims!

157
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,950
趁现在！
Now!

158
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,440
很好 这可真是太帅了！
Well, isn't that just grand?

159
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,620
啊…上帝啊…
Ah! God do...

160
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,920
我说“帅”了吗？人家是说这可真是太无礼了！
Did I say "grand"? I meant totally rude.

161
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,630
啊！我的光学镜！
Ahh! My optics!

162
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,220
哦 现在我们要玩人类的游戏吗？
Oh! Are we playing a human game now?

163
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:33,700
因为我很愿意教你霸天虎的玩法――捉迷杀 哈哈哈！
Because I would be happy to teach you the Decepticon version: "hide-and-go-shriek". Ha ha ha!

164
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,630
琼…琼…你在哪儿？
June! June, where are you?

165
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,540
啊哈！
Aha!

166
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,330
好了 小女人 出来吧
All right, little lady, show yourself.

167
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,770
不然我就把这个潮男变成柏油路上的一滩血水！
Or I turn the snappy dresser here into a sloppy stain on the tarmac.

168
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,290
你已拨通了福勒探员 听到星条旗的哔哔声请留言
You've reached special Agent William Fowler. Leave a message at the star-spangled beep.

169
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,080
直接跑到留言了 就像妈妈的手机一样
Straight to voicemail, just like Mom's cell.

170
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,610
也许他们去看电影了
Maybe they went to a movie?

171
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,960
啊 好吧 逃避小隔
Hum... Okay. Running from Bulk

172
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,960
拒绝通话 我真是个懦夫
shutting down like that, pretty spineless of me.

173
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,620
往好处想 现在你骨头硬多了
On the bright side, you have plenty of backbone now.

174
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,680
阿尔茜 我需要你帮忙
Arcee, I need your help.

175
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,280
我妈妈和福勒可能有大麻烦了
My Mom and Fowler may be in serious trouble.

176
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,830
最后的机会 女人类
Last chance, she-human.

177
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,350
如果你不拿着我的战利品在2.3秒内出现的话 你的男朋友…
If you're not out here with my prize in 2.3 seconds, your boyfriend here...

178
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,560
好 首先 他不是我男朋友
Okay, first, not my boyfriend.

179
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,230
啊…
Ah!

180
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,100
其次 你一根手指头也不能碰他
And second, you're not laying a metal digit on him.

181
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,670
要是你还想见到你宝贝爪子的话
Not if you ever want to see your precious talon again.

182
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,500
- 它在哪儿？\N- 放开她！
- Where is it?\N- Leave her alone!

183
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,990
我把它藏在一截车厢里了\N如果你放我们走 我就告诉你是哪一节
I hid it on a train car. Let us go, and I'll tell you which one.

184
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,320
班门弄斧 在欺诈的鼻祖面前
Try as you might, you can't con a 'Con.

185
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,190
系好安全带 前面的路会异常颠簸
Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy ride.

186
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,770
哦 对了 你们没法不系紧 我的错
Oh, wait, you can't unfasten your belts. My bad.

187
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,880
通讯中断有多久了？
Communications have been down for how long?!

188
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,540
声波就要把接收器修好了 主人
Soundwave practically has the dish repaired, Master.

189
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,720
对声波来说 这自然不在话下 而你…
Which is all well and good for Soundwave, but for you...

190
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,100
击倒呼叫威震天陛下 请回话！
Knockout to Lord Megatron, please, come in.

191
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,550
看？完全修好了
See? All fixed.

192
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,310
击倒 巨狰狞的骸骨到手没有？
Knockout, do you have the Predacon bone?

193
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,650
在我视野之内 君王 就像在后面追赶我的两个汽车人一样
In my sites, my liege. As are a pair of Autobots riding my rear.

194
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,380
知道了 务必把标本弄到手
Understood. Just make sure you secure the specimen.

195
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,540
好 一个诡诈的小人类会把骨头藏在哪一节车厢里呢？
Now, in which train car would a Deceptive little human choose to bury a bone?

196
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,510
我赌它在敞篷的那节车里
My money's on the convertible.

197
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,190
去救福勒和琼！
Get Fowler and June!

198
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,590
你们该下车了！
Here's where you get out.

199
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,860
威震天陛下 要是还不快开环陆桥 你的标本就要归汽车人了！
Lord Megatron, if a groundbridge doesn't open "tout de suite", your specimen will belong to the Autobots.

200
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,880
该死！
Scrap.

201
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,930
他们在哪儿？
Where are they?

202
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,910
在后面
In back.

203
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,870
- 啊!\N- 呼!
- Ah.\N- Whoo.

204
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,560
妈妈！
Mom!

205
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,030
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

206
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,120
无风险公务变成了高风险任务 但我和比尔都没事
The milk run turned a little sour, but Bill and I are just fine.

207
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,380
来 琼 坐下
Come on, June, sit down.

208
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,180
比尔？
Bill?

209
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,480
看来你的位置被“顶”了 杰克
Looks like you've been jacked, Jack

210
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,280
被千斤顶
by another 'Jack.

211
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,160
兄弟情胜过浪漫情啊！
Bro-mance trumps romance.

212
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,670
真高兴做你的兄弟 兄弟
Glad to be your bro, bro.

213
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,820
你今天干得很出色 击倒
You have served me well today, Knockout.

214
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,220
比某个人强出不少
which is more than I can say for some.

215
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,700
是那只畜牲扰乱通讯的 我的君王
It was the beast that disrupted communications, my liege.

216
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,900
我请求您重新考虑巨狰狞计划
I beg you to reconsider project Predacon.

217
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,570
那东西不可救药
The creature is incorrigible

218
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,660
除了最基本的智能外 一无是处
and void of all but the most rudimentary intelligence.
