频谱分析确认

00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,420
可惜你无法眼看着自己的研究成果开枝散叶
But pity you won't live long enough to witness the fruits of your labor.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,620
是你那高高在上的首领 想要除掉你们巨狰狞
Your high and mighty leader wanted your Predacons exterminated!

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,830
而我唯一的错误就是没有斩草除根
And my only mistake was not seeing the extermination through.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,330
你应该在我面前保持野兽形态
You should have faced me as a beast!

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,240
动用所有剩余力量！

在此与他决一死战！

Optimus, if we fail to secure the lock before it's ready to deploy

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,350
要不要把它摧毁？

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,760
我不打算再次浪费复苏塞博特恩的机会
I do not intend to squander a second chance to restore Cybertron.

你们先去
Go on without me.

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,670
你要开小差吗？
That isn't the mission.

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,580
我得先去做件事
There's something I need to do.

33
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,870
关掉它 震荡波
Shut it down, Shockwave.

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,500
我决不允许你危害地球！
I cannot allow you to harm Earth.

这个星球不会受到伤害
The planet will not be harmed...

36
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,710
毁灭的只不过是本地的物种
only its indigenous life-forms.

37
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,910
除非你跨过我的尸体！
Over my sparkless husk.

幸好你还在这儿
I was hoping you'd still be here.

夺取舰桥！
Secure the bridge!

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,180
通天晓呼叫所有单位 我们要迟到了

49
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,820
声波又玩儿了一次传送的花招
Soundwave pulled one of his relocation tricks.

50
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,520
拉夫 能把我弄到战舰的舰桥上吗？
Raf, can you get me onto the warship's bridge?

51
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,920
当然能 我已经掌握了它的坐标

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,460
但你怎么可能敌得过声波？！
But you won't have a chance against Soundwave.

53
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,460
有后援就行
I will if I have backup.

54
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,550

威震天陛下 终极之锁充能完毕 准备就绪

57
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,660
什么？噢 该死！
Eh! Oh, scrap!

58
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,250
没想到吧！
Surprise!

59
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,120
喝！
Hah!

60
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,260
别以大欺小啊！
Pick on someone your own size.

61
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,830
拉夫 好戏该开始了！
Raf, showtime!

62
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,300
真的要这样吗 杰克？
Are you sure about this, Jack?

63
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,570
上次能量流重叠…
Last time you crossed the streams...

64
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,900
动手 拉夫 快！
Do it, Raf... now!

快 得弄明白怎么驾驶这个大家伙

震荡波 准备发射…

68
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,290

喔哇！
Whoa!

70
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,280

伙计 你是哪个驾校的？！
Dude, where'd you learn to drive?

72
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,740
快递到了！

73
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,050
那边 对吧？
That way, right?

74
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,960
擎天柱 接着！
Optimus! Catch!

75
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,340

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,570
擎天柱 你必须用星辰剑毁掉终极之锁！
Optimus, you must use the Saber to destroy the Omega Lock.

77
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,540
这是拯救地球的唯一办法！
It is the onty way to save Earth!

78
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,670
星辰剑！
The Star Saber!

79
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,870
不！
No!

80
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,080
跟你的侦察兵一起回归火种源吧！
Prepare to join your scout in the Allspark.

81
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,550
威震天！
Megatron!

82
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,740
你夺走了我的声音！
You took my voice.

83
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,740
可你休想再夺走任何人的任何东西！
You will never rob anyone of anything ever again.

大黄蜂
Bumblebee!

89
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,030
你的声音…
Your voice...

90
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,930
我的声音 你说什么…
My voice? What are you...

91
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,100
我的声音！
my voice!

92
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,180
救护车 我的发声器回来了！
Ratchet, I have my pipes back!

93
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,640
没错 没错！我们听出来了
Yes. Yes, we noticed.

94
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,400
是塞博特恩网状物
The cyber matter...

95
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,270
这是唯一合理的解释
It is the only possible explanation.

96
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,760
看来曾经的战地医生终于兑现承诺了
It would seem the old field medic made good after all.

97
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,070
擎天柱呼叫所有单位 威震天已不复存在
Optimus Prime to all units.

98
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,890
太棒了！
Yes!

99
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,180
- 呜哇！\N- 雷霆救援队 夺取舰桥的任务完成得非常出色
Hooah!

100
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,620
并非我们所为 长官
It wasn't us, sir.

101
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
都是人类的功劳
The credit belongs to the humans.

102
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,430
哦耶！
Hoo-Yeah!

103
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,650
终极之锁掌握在我们手中
The Omega Lock is under our control.

104
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,260
我建议物尽其用
I propose that we put it to good use.

105
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,220
我同意 老朋友
Agreed, old friend.

106
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,420
通天晓 设定航向 飞往塞博特恩
Ultra Magnus, set course for Cybertron.

107
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,950
嘿 拉夫 跟你的笔记本小别几秒钟
Hey, Raf, if you could tear yourself away from your laptop for two seconds...

108
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,880
把自己传送过来 咱们一起去塞博特恩吧
grid yourself up here so we can get to Cybertron already.

109
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,590
等等 那是谁？
Wait. Who's that?

110
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,330
小蜂？
Bee?

111
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,840
呃啊 你的胳膊肘快捅进我的腰里了！
Eh... ah. Your elbow articulator is digging into my lateral flexor!

112
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,970
你打算一路都这样抱怨下去么？
Do you intend to whine for the duration of the voyage?

113
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,960
擎天柱 我…一直都没参透
Optimus, I... was never able to learn

114
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,710
震荡波对于网状物的研究
Shockwave's side of the cyber matter equation.

115
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,270
我们可能只有这些了
This may be all we ever have.

116
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,060
而塞博特恩要比地球大得多
And Cybertron is a much larger planet than Earth.

117
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,810
那么我们必须将网状物注入塞博特恩的核心
Then we must launch the cyber matter at Cybertron's very core.

118
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,810
注入原始天尊的心脏？
Into the heart of Primus himself?

119
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,080
指挥官 我们已经抵达火种源之井
Commander, we've arrived at the Well of all Sparks.

120
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,330
啊 多美的光辉啊！
Ahh. Such luster.

121
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,860
怎么了 我本来就是墙头草嘛！
What? I'm joining the winning team.

122
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,110
呀啊！
Aaah!

123
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,990
是那只巨狰狞
The Predacon.

124
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,560
尽管家园重获了维持生命的能力
Though our home world is once again capable of supporting life...

125
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,270
但我们仍有很多重建工作要做
we have much rebuilding to do.

126
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,000
也罢 我们会怀念远方这个家园的
Alas, we will miss our home away from home

127
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,020
还有这里的亲人
and the family we've made here.

128
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,950
逍遥法外的虎子 不会再打地球的主意吗？
If 'Cons are still out there, won't Earth be on their radar?

129
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,160
拉夫 只要你们需要我 需要我们做任何事情
Raf, if you ever need me, need us for any reason

130
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,090
我们就在太空桥的另一头
we're just a space bridge away.

131
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
而且 我们会得到妥善照顾\N你 杰克和神子 将继续为E部门效力
Besides, we'll be in good hands with

132
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,990
就算是半官方身份
In our semi-Official capacity.

133
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,760
哇喔 我们是探员了？
Whoa! We are Agents?!

134
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,070
是顾问
Consultants.

135
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,300
直到年龄符合要求
Until you're of age.

136
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,760
我相信E部门不会食古不化
I trust that Unit-E doesn't have any rules

137
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,650
拒绝招募一个老掉牙的汽车人顾问吧？
forbidding the enlistment of rusty, old Autobot consultants?

138
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,670
救护车 你竟然…
Ratchet? You of all...

139
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,200
没错没错！
Yep, yep, yep.

140
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,550
我知道自己的价值所在
I know where I am needed.

141
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,600
拉夫…
Raf...

142
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,560
我明白 小蜂
I know, Bee.

143
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,100
什么都不用说
You don't need to say anything.

144
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,650
以前我也没说过
I never did.

145
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,220
神子 我觉得现在…
Miko, I guess this is...

146
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,540
这段旅途我永生难忘
It's been quite a ride.

147
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,100
保持联络 杰克
Keep in touch, Jack.

148
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,470
别逼我回来追你
Don't make me hunt you down.

149
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,280
来日再会 老朋友
Until we meet again, old friend.
