1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,270
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,000
不 别动也别说话 保存力量
No, don't move or talk. Just power down.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,980
一个新政权统治了你们的世界
A new power dominates your world.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,240
任何针对我的进一步挑衅行为
Any further attempts to attack me

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,620
我都会加倍奉还！
will be met with even greater force!

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,640
神子！
Miko

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,890
不许用手机 你知道规矩的！
no cellphone! You know the rules!

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,940
一条短信应该不会有事吧？
One text couldn't hurt, could it?

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,680
我明白擎天柱为避免虎子抓到我们 将我们分别传送到不同地点
I realize Optimus sent us all to different locations to make us harder for the 'Cons to find

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,030
但如果我们不知道其他人的位置 该怎么找到他们呢？！
but if we don't know where in the world anyone else went, how are we gonna find them?

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,710
告诉我你同伙的藏身之地
Tell me the location of your compatriots

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,890
用什么手段 花多长时间
no matter what it takes or how long.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,550
集结一支队伍 立刻飞往塞博特恩
Assemble a team and disembark for Cybertron immediately.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,030
他还…活着！
He lives?

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,770
震荡波！
Shockwave!

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,740
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,190
震荡波
Shockwave!

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,190
这可真是一份大大的意外之喜
This is quite an unexpected turn.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,520
我以为你已经在塞博特恩阵亡了
I thought you'd perished on Cybertron.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,220
是啊 是啊 我们都这么以为…
Yes, as... as did we all.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,200
如此轻易地宣告我的死亡 过于草率了
Reports of my demise were greatly premature.

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,490
两个汽车人潜入了我在塞博特恩上的实验室
A pair of Autobots infiltrated my facility on Cybertron

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,660
破坏了我的太空桥
sabotaging my space bridge.

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,270
我尝试进行追击 但却徒劳无功
I gave chase but failed to accurately calculate the outcome.

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,270
我在一片废墟之中醒来 完全失明
I awoke in the rubble, blinded.

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,150
我很快意识到 我所在的星球已被遗弃
It soon became clear that I was marooned on our dead planet

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,160
没有留下任何通信渠道
with no means of communication.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,430
我花费时日修复了自身的伤口 并重新投身于我的实验之中
In time, I repaired my wounds and resumed my experiments.

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,330
与世隔绝的我心无旁骛 于是我的研究突飞猛进
The solitude enabled me to make tremendous advances in my research.

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,780
直到有一天
Until one day

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,580
我的系统检测到不明能量大规模激增…
my instruments detected a massive surge of unidentifiable energy.

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,740
于是我前往锈海边缘调查其源头
I traveled to investigate its origin at the edge of the Sea of Rust

33
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,880
在那里我与您的搜索队不期而遇
where I encountered your salvage team

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,200
并发现了终极之锁的残片
and the smoldering wreckage of the Omega Lock.

35
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,940
但是这个搜索队并不是为我而来
But this was not the search party I had anticipated so long ago.

36
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,790
所以我有一个问题亟需解答：
Leaving one unanswered question.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,230
为什么将我留下自生自灭 为什么将我遗弃
Why was I left for scrap, abandoned?

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,430
为什么？
Why?

39
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,570
那…那场大爆炸…
The... the... the explosion, it...

40
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,080
使核心能量室崩塌了
it collapsed the power-core chamber.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,130
我们只目睹你冲进太空桥入口
The last thing anyone witnessed was you charging into the space-bridge portal.

42
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,880
但没人看见你出来！
No one saw you come back out!

43
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,050
我判定 你的回答…符合逻辑
I find your reply to be... logical.

44
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,870
不过有件事一定会让你非常高兴
But you will be pleased to know that I avenged your seeming demise by

45
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,700
我亲手解决了汽车人飞过山！
personally terminating the Autobot Cliffjumper.

46
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,760
杀个小角色也值得炫耀 红蜘蛛 小心风大闪了舌头
Careful, Starscream. You may dislocate a landing gear patting yourself on the back.

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,110
作为威震天的首席副官
As Megatron's First Lieutenant

48
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,440
请允许我欢迎你回归胜利之师
allow me to welcome you back to the winning team.

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,350
那么也请允许我来颁布新的指挥体系
And allow me to clarify the new chain of command.

50
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,210
在红蜘蛛保持军事行动指挥权的同时
While Starscream will retain authority over military operations

51
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,120
任命震荡波为我的首席副官 掌管一切科学研究事宜
Shockwave will be my First Lieutenant in charge of all scientific endeavors.

52
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,930
所以 您的意思是我和他平起平坐？
Uh, so you are saying we shall each report directly to you.

53
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,580
正是如此
Affirmative.

54
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,370
毫无逻辑性可言 我的君王
Completely logical, my liege.

55
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,770
嘿 你饿了吗？
Hey, you hungry?

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,710
前面有个小镇
There's a town up ahead.

57
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,290
还是算了吧 我的钱包已经瘪了
I'd better not. I'm running low on cash.

58
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,240
至少你不用买汽油
At least you don't have to buy gasoline.

59
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,530
但我还是要停一下 得活动下筋骨…
I'm pulling over anyway. Need to stretch my legs.

60
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,030
啊 舒坦！
Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,980
阿尔茜 领袖卫队已经四分五裂了
Arcee... team Prime is scattered to the winds.

62
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,310
从目前的情况看 你和我可能是仅有的幸存者
For all we know, you and I could be the only ones left.

63
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,280
我不这么认为 杰克 而且我知道你也一样
I don't believe that, Jack, and I know you don't either.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,550
也许吧
Maybe not.

65
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,820
但是敌我力量相差如此悬殊
But the Decepticons outnumber us 100 to 1.

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,950
难道就没有其他汽车人能助我们一臂之力吗？
Aren't there any more Autobots out there who could help?

67
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,740
塞博特恩之战伤亡惨重
The War For Cybertron took a heavy toll.

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,860
但当时确实有人乘方舟逃了出去
But there were others who escaped in the ark.

69
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,490
那么…他们在哪儿？
So, where are they?

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,590
流落四方…
Scattered to the winds.

71
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,380
所以我们还是把精力集中在赶回贾斯帕
So, let's focus on getting back to Jasper

72
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,030
重聚领袖卫队上吧
and getting team Prime back together.

73
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,430
没有新发现 小蜂
Nada, Bee.

74
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,080
还是那些早就看过的合成图片
Just the same old rubber masks and bad C.G.

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,590
网站也许是我们找到其他人的唯一途径了…
But the usualconspiracy websites might be our only chance to...

76
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,760
看！我找到了！
Whoa! I found something!

77
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,760
是救护车！
It's Ratchet!

78
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,080
震荡波明显是在向我示威
Shockwave's toadying is so transparent.

79
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,250
威震天只重视实干家 而非信口开河之徒
Megatron's respect is earned by deeds, not words.

80
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,620
没用！没用！没用！
Useless, useless, useless.

81
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,460
那些讨厌的人类手上有数十亿台照相机
Billions of cameras in the hands of those miserable humans.

82
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,060
总会有人拍到汽车人的…
One of them is bound to catch an Autobot eventually.

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,460
瞧啊 瞧啊
Well, well, well.

84
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,770
这是谁呢？
What have we here?

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,470
威震天陛下 我找到了点您一定会感兴趣的东西！
Lord Megatron, I have found something of great interest!

86
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,790
这张照片是昨天拍的
The photo was taken yesterday

87
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,700
在森林公园外的废车场
in a junkyard outside Woodland Park.

88
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,910
我得删去救护车 再替换上…
I'd better scrub Ratchet and replace him with...

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,020
一个汽车人！
An Autobot!

90
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,240
等等 什么？
Wait, what?

91
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,490
他刚才还在上面的！你们肯定有人看见了！
It was just here! Surely, one of you saw it.

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,830
红蜘蛛
Starscream...

93
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,590
有时候你要向声波好好学学
you would do well to take a cue from Soundwave on occasion

94
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,560
别总是一惊一乍的
and keep things to yourself!

95
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,870
给我安静点 这该死的图片
Vow of silence... such a cop-out.

96
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,510
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron

97
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,400
比起这个落后的数据网络 我们的汽车人俘虏无疑是更好的消息来源
surely our Autobot prisoner is a better source of information than this primitive data net.

98
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,600
提醒你一下 震荡波
I will have you know, Shockwave, that I have been grinding Wheeljack down for days.

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,010
如果他真知道些什么 早就全盘托出了
If he knew anything, he would've spilled it by now.

100
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,680
的确 有些人确实比其他人更能管住自己的嘴
Again, some prove to be better at holding their tongues than others.

101
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,860
如果你放弃低劣的肉体折磨\N而使用一些尖端的科技 效果可能会更好
Perhaps you would have better results if instead of a club you used a scalpel.

102
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,550
我推荐我的大脑神经接入器
I recommend a cortical psychic patch.

103
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,920
我觉得他不会来了
I don't think he's coming.

104
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,610
别担心 神子
Don't worry, Miko...

105
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,510
每个雷霆救援队员都熟知紧急方案
every Wrecker knows the protocol.

106
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,370
只要他还活着 老千就一定会出现…
Jackie will show. If he's still kicking.

107
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,300
拿出你的看家本领吧 医生
Do your worst, Doc.

108
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,040
我是名雷霆救援队员 我扛得住
I'm a Wrecker. I can take it.

109
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,130
相信我 事实上 你不能
Trust me... you, in fact, cannot.

110
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,750
接入器没能取得任何关于汽车人行踪的新信息
The patch failed to yield any new information on the whereabouts of the Autobots.

111
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,290
嗯…我知道了…
Um... I see...

112
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,000
这么看来 千斤顶已经没有利用价值了
Ah, then it would seem that Wheeljack has outlived his usefulness.

113
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,610
如果您允许 威震天陛下
With your permission, Lord Megatron

114
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,460
我立刻去把他解决掉…
I will see to his immediate termination.

115
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,190
醒醒 雷霆救援队小子
Wake up, Wrecker.

116
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,690
该洗热水澡了！
Time to smelt.

117
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,080
红蜘蛛指挥官想让你清醒过来
Commander Starscream wanted you conscious

118
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,460
这样你就能明白是谁送你上路
so you'd know precisely who ordered your execution.

119
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,130
小红他人呢？
Where is Screamy?

120
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,620
他不敢亲自动手？
Doesn't have the bearings to do this himself?

121
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,010
跳下去！
Jump.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
嘿 你会飞吧？
Hey, are you a flier?

123
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,140
好吧 我跳就是了
Okay, I'll jump.

124
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,220
果然能飞！
Thought so!

125
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,600
谢谢你捎我一程
Thanks for the ride.

126
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,080
你就是这么办事的？
This is how you handle things?!

127
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
千斤顶不是第一个从红蜘蛛手上逃走的俘虏了
Wheeljack is not the first prisoner to escape Starscream's care.

128
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,780
实际上 主人
Actually, master

129
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,610
是我故意让千斤顶逃走的
I allowed Wheeljack to escape.

130
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,430
你说什么？！
You what?!

131
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,690
但是那个汽车人的一举一动
But the Autobot's every move

132
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,220
一言一语都会在我们的监视之下…
his every word, will be monitored.

133
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,950
因为我在囚犯昏迷不醒时 给他植入了一枚简易跟踪器
Thanks to a simple tracking device implanted while the prisoner was still unconscious

134
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,050
当然 是在某人的大脑神经接入器失败后实施的
following the failed cortical psychic patch.

135
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,960
接下来 我们只需要等一等 看一看 听一听
Now all we have to do is wait, watch, and listen.

136
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,230
一旦他与其他汽车人会合
When the Wrecker reunites with the other Autobots

137
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,780
我的大军就会将他们一网打尽…
my armada will strike.

138
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,350
他应该就在这儿！
He's got to be here.

139
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,190
救护车！救护车 是我 拉夫
Ratchet! Ratchet, it's me, Raf!

140
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,190
嗯…救护车？
Uh, Ratchet?

141
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,760
走开
Go away!

142
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,060
你们打扰到我的休息了！
You're interrupting my power down.

143
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,800
别闹了 救护车 我们需要你的帮助来找到其他人
Come on, Ratchet, we need your help to find the others.

144
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,070
我们是斗不过威震天的！再也不能了
We can't stop Megatron, not anymore.

145
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,660
战争结束了 我们一败涂地
The war is over, and we lost.

146
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,490
你放弃了？
You're giving up?!

147
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,030
我们不能就这么放弃了！
We can't just give up!

148
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,560
那么你告诉我 我们还能做什么！
Then tell me what we can do

149
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,440
没有了通信设备 没有了环陆桥
without communications, without a ground bridge

150
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,050
没有了任何设备或物资…
without a base of operations or resources of any kind!

151
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,250
小蜂说得对
Bee's right.

152
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,360
我们知道红蜘蛛在其单独行动期间 使用过环陆桥
We know Starscream had access to a ground bridge while he was operating solo.

153
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,100
是的 是的 他利用了霸天虎的废弃飞船 先驱号
Yes, yes, he'd clearly been using the derelict Decepticon ship the Harbinger.

154
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,890
但是那有什么用！
What does that have to do with anything?!

155
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,220
那上面可能装满了各种塞博特恩资源
It could be full of Cybertronian tech

156
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,840
既然红蜘蛛已经回到虎子中间了
and it's probably abandoned again now

157
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,650
那飞船可能再次被遗弃了
that Starscream's back with the 'Cons.

158
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:52,590
好吧 物资再多又能怎么样 如果没有人来…领导我们
Well, resources won't be of much use, not without someone to... lead us.

159
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,470
但这是一个好的开始！
It's a start!

160
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,680
那你们去找别人一起开始吧！
You'll have to start without me.

161
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,750
这场战争已经和我无关了
This is someone else's fight now.

162
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,100
没有别人了 救护车 只有我们！
There is no one else, Ratchet... just us

163
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,650
只有领袖卫队！
just the team.

164
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,930
拜托你们…
Please!

165
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,510
就让我安静地去自生自灭吧
Just let me... rust in peace.

166
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,840
我们走吧 小蜂…
Come on, Bee.

167
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,130
我回来了
I'm back.

168
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,390
我扫描了基地的每个角落
I combed through every square micron of our old base.

169
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,340
也没能找到救护车的医药箱 甚至连条绷带都没有
I couldn't find Ratchet's medical kit, not even a bandage.

170
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,230
卓天越…之锤…
The Forge... of Solus Prime.

171
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,050
也没了 虎子们把基地搜刮得一干二净！
It's gone, too. The 'Cons picked the place clean.

172
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,160
等等
Wait

173
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,200
如果你有了卓天越之锤 就能自我修复了 借领袖之力！
if you had the Forge, you could fix yourself up... power of the Primes.

174
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,540
擎天柱 再坚持一下
Optimus, hang on just a little longer.

175
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,580
锤子一定就在威震天堡垒的某个地方
That hammer's got to be somewhere in Megatron's fortress.

176
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,150
神子？快醒醒！
Miko, wake up.

177
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,290
为什么？
Why?

178
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,090
有人来了
Someone's coming.

179
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,970
不管在哪里 我都听得出这引擎声！
I'd know the hum of that engine anywhere!

180
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,980
哈哈 老千！
Ah! Jackie!

181
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,580
你去哪儿啦 兄弟？
Where have you been, buddy?!

182
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,630
和几个老相识叙了叙旧
Catching up with a few old dance partners.

183
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,900
见到你很高兴 孩子
Good to see you, kid.

184
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,330
看来这附近就只有我们三位雷霆救援队员了
Safe to assume we're the only three Wreckers around?

185
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,330
那我们还等什么？去闹个天翻地覆吧！
So, what are we waiting for? Let's do some damage!

186
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,410
下一步做什么 老千？绕回基地？
What's our next move, Jackie... circle back to base?

187
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,570
没有基地了 虎子们把那儿炸平了
There is no base. 'Cons blasted it to dust.

188
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,880
这些白痴果然被我玩弄于股掌之中…
The dimwit played right into my hands.

189
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,280
集合全体追踪者 我们已锁定敌军位置！
All seekers to the flight deck! We have pinpointed the enemy!

190
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,610
进攻 我的大军！
Attack! My armada.

191
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,120
我们已到达指定坐标 红蜘蛛指挥官
We're at the coordinates, Commander Starscream.

192
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,490
做好准备 他们正在向你们靠近…
Hold fast. They are approaching your position.

193
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,080
目标进入范围
Targets in range?

194
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,110
那就“轰”！
And boom.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,160
是手雷！
Grenade!

196
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,420
他…他耍了我们？！
He... he tricked us!

197
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,660
你怎么知道虎子在你身上装了追踪器？
How'd you know the 'Cons planted a tracker on you?

198
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,790
我猜到虎子们会耍花招
I figured the 'Cons were up to something

199
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
于是我对引擎盖下面做了点儿小检查
so I did a little poking around under my hood.

200
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,360
哈哈 不愧是我的老千
Ha! That's my Jackie.

201
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,430
那么 我们的下一步行动是什么？
So, what's our next move?

202
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,420
途中我从钻击号那里抢回了些弹药
I salvaged some munitions from the Jackhammer on my way out.

203
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,610
你觉得刚才动静儿大吗？
You thought that made a loud noise?

204
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,510
好戏才刚开始…
Just wait.

205
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
就这样别动 小蜂
Hold it right there, Bee.

206
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,740
然后 启动电源！
And... powering up!

207
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,170
再试试 我们会弄明白的！
Keep trying. We'll figure it out.

208
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,410
不对 不对 不对
Ah-ah-ah.

209
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,420
你们把能量转换装置都调校错了
You're miscalibrating the Energon transducer.

210
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,700
救护车！
Ratchet!

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,930
好啦 让开点儿 好让我工作！
Now step out of my way so I can work.

212
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,730
上次事情变糟的时候 擎天柱给了我钥匙芯片！
The last time things looked this bleak, Optimus slipped me that key card...

213
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,670
至少我们还能把它当做希望！
something we could hang our hopes on.

214
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,730
我理解你无助的感觉 杰克
I know you're feeling helpless, Jack.

215
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,930
但你不必把它当做负担
This doesn't need to be your burden.

216
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,840
呆在我身后
Stay behind me.

217
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,410
杰克 我觉得这次我们不需要钥匙芯片了
Jack, I don't think we're gonna need that key card.

218
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,460
来见见通天晓
Meet Ultra Magnus.

219
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,450
你不仅没能消灭汽车人
So, not only did you fail to destroy the Autobots

220
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,980
还壮大了他们的队伍！
but you allowed their number to increase!

221
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,400
难道就没人能取得了汽车人的脑袋吗？
Is there no one who can bring me their heads?!

222
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,540
请允许我向您禀报 威震天陛下
If I may, lord Megatron.

223
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,000
我在塞博特恩的流亡期间
During my exile on Cybertron

224
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,050
我重新启动了一个搁置已久的研究项目
I resumed work on a long-dormant project...

225
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,120
我相信这个项目能解决我们目前的难题
One that I believe may provide a solution to our current problem.

226
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,630
塞博特恩核酸？（类似人类的D.N.A.）
Cyber nucleic acid?

227
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,480
这是构建所有塞博特恩生命的基础
The building blocks of all Cybertronian life.

228
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,920
它源自我在塞星上发掘出的一个标本
This hails from a specimen I excavated upon our planet

229
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,340
而且对其检测的结果很令人满意
and has yielded promising results.

230
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,740
汽车人屡次从我们手中逃脱
The Autobots continue to evade us.

231
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,390
我们怎么能指望培养皿里产生的
What makes you think we can afford to wait for the answer to our prayers to be

232
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,010
…某种试验品呢？
birthed in some Petri dish?

233
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,690
你误解了我的意思
You misunderstand.

234
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,920
实验对象已经被完全培育成功
The subject has been fully cultivated.

235
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,530
我只需将其从塞博特恩的实验室传送过来
It need only be transported from my laboratory on Cybertron.

236
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,490
那还等什么 启动太空桥！
Then by all means, activate the space bridge.

237
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,080
很荣幸向您展示 我的君王
I present to you, my liege...

238
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,910
终极汽车人猎手！
the ultimate Autobot hunter.
