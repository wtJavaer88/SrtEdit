1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,480
唉 苦日子何时是个头儿啊？
Oh, will my torment never end?

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,470
从前要与那只奸诈的鹰身女妖毒蜘蛛\N争讨威震天的欢心
First, I had to vie for Megatron's favor against that treacherous harpy, Airachnid.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,650
现在 震荡波和他那些无可救药的野兽又来跟我争宠
Now I must contend with Shockwave and his incorrigible beast!

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,940
噢 想想好的一面嘛 红蜘蛛
Oh, look on the bright side, Starscream.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,640
至少其中一个已经冻成了雕像
At least one of them is currently on ice

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,480
严严实实地锁在战舰的保险库里
locked up tight in the vault of our warship.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:34,120
我真想把震荡波和他那些\N可恨的癞皮狗也塞进静止舱里！
How I would love to stuff Shockwave and his mangy abomination right into that stasis pod beside her!

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,600
他的巨狰狞计划之所以能够顺风顺水
The only reason his "Project Predacon" is currently in full swing

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,480
全靠本座帮他找回了那几十具巨狰狞骸骨
is because I supervised the acquisition of his dozens of Predacon bones.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,250
在我发牢骚的时候
Will you please keep your lab rat quiet

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,660
能不能让你的小白鼠别哼哼了？
while I'm airing my grievances?

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,350
红蜘蛛…救救我…
Starscream, help me!

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,380
哎呀呀 你都对可怜的塞拉斯做了什么啊？
My, my, my... Whatever have you been inflicting upon poor Cylas?

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,680
哈 都是些活体培养皿该干的事
Ha! Well anything that merits the need for a living petri dish.

15
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,150
你不顾及里面人类的死活倒也罢了
Despite your justifiable lack of regard for his human side

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:26,230
但看着你前搭档的残体受尽折磨 你于心何忍？
It doesn't trouble you to watch what remains of your former partner endure your scientific endeavors?

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,280
没啥感觉\N此外 塞拉斯也曾把打击绑在他的试验台上
Not really. Besides, Cylas once had poor Breakdown pinned to his lab table.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,180
我想我的前搭档会很乐意享受其中的
I think my former partner would be pleased to be a part.

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,150
怎么回事？
What just happened?

20
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,500
记得我从汽车人那里还原的人造能量吗？
You recall that synthetic energon I recovered from the Autobots?

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,710
我按照配方复制了一些 以测试它作为替代能源的效果
Well, I've been reproducing the formula to test its viability as an alternative energy source.

22
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,100
不过 这种化合物很不稳定 而且明显带有副作用
However, the compound remains erratic, and there have been side effects.

23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,670
比方说？
Such as?

24
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,710
红蜘蛛 希望你换过变形齿轮
Starscream, I hope you replaced your t-cog.

25
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,410
因为我会再把它扯出来 塞进击倒的臭嘴里！
Because I'm going to tear it out all over again and feed it to knock out!

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,570
产生不受控制的攻击性
Sheer unbridled aggression.

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,130
瞧瞧这力量 这怒火！
Such power and fury!

28
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,500
威震天不是一直想要个超级野兽机器战士嘛
Megatron has long desired a beast machine super soldier.

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,800
看来我们能为他供货了
And we now possess the means of delivering one to him.

30
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,690
跟我说说那些巨狰狞原生体
Tell me of the Predacon protoforms.

31
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,250
它们的孵化进度如何？
What is the status of their incubation?

32
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,700
嗯 嗯…
Mm-hm. Uh-huh...

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,770
主人 我可不是往自己脸上贴金
Master, if I do say so myself

34
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,300
我有了一个迷人的发现 它看起来…
I have made the most intriguing discovery. It appears that--

35
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,880
别来烦我！
Not now!

36
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,890
请继续 震荡波
Please continue, Shockwave.

37
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,300
不…不是什么重要角色
No, no one important.

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,590
你和我们的君王说了吗？关于我们的那个小计划？
Did you speak with our liege about our little enterprise?

39
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,980
他正忙别的事呢
He was otherwise engaged.

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,230
我会用你们想象不到的手段 折磨死你们！
I am going to make you suffer in ways you will not believe!

41
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,520
你给他注射了多少合成能量？
Just how much of this synth-en have you given him?

42
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,890
又打了两针 顶多三针
Two additional doses, three at the most.

43
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,950
不过 塞拉斯越来越不稳定的状态 还不是唯一的问题
But Cylas' increasingly volatile nature isn't the only wrinkle.

44
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,680
似乎这种绿玩意 我给他注射得越多
It appears that the more green stuff I administer

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,470
这只由打击变成的怪物 体内原本的能量就消耗得越快
the faster this monstrosity formerly known as Breakdown burns through his own natural energon reserves.

46
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,140
那怎么行！
This will not do!

47
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,190
威震天已经有巨狰狞那种狂暴的野兽了
Megatron already possesses one unruly beast with that Predacon of his!

48
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,400
再给他一只无法控制的怪物能有什么…
What good is another freak of nature that cannot be controlled?

49
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,160
等等… 我傻了不是？
Wait. I'm a fool...

50
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,250
黑暗能量？！
Dark Energon!?

51
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,220
你不是傻 红蜘蛛！
You are more than a fool, Starscream.

52
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,290
我看你是大脑短路了！
I think your neural cluster has blown a massive fuse!

53
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,330
噢 恰恰相反 我亲爱的医生
Oh, on the contrary, dear doctor.

54
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,720
将黑暗能量加入配方 能让威震天陛下完全控制他的超级战士
Adding Dark Energon to the formula should provide Lord Megatron with full control over his super-soldier.

55
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,060
没错 威震天陛下确实与注射了\N黑暗能量的人或物体有某种共生联系
Okay, true that Lord Megatron seems to possess a symbiotic link to anyone or thing infused with the dark matter

56
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,420
借此他可以像操纵木偶一样控制他们
allowing him to manipulate them as if they were puppets.

57
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,970
但是 难道你忘了这所谓的“宇宙大帝之血”\N对我们的战舰做了什么吗？
But... have you forgotten what the so-called Blood of Unicron did to our warship!?

58
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,610
那是因为注射量过大
That was the result of a massive infusion.

59
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:30,600
我建议加一两滴 刚好可以让\N我们的主人随心所欲地控制他的战士
I am suggesting a drop or two, merely enough to allow our master to command his warrior at will.

60
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,220
即便如此 没经过震荡波的批准就这么干 太冒险了！
Even so, it's too drastic a measure to undertake without Shockwave's approval.

61
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,100
毕竟我现在归他管
I do, after all, report to him.

62
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,140
这个项目与他无关！
Not on this project!

63
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,320
超级战士项目属于军事行动
Super soldiers fall under military operations

64
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,910
也就是说 亲爱的击倒 你现在归我管
Meaning, dear knock out, that you now report to me.

65
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,640
明白了么？
Are we clear?

66
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,450
等着看好戏吧
Wait for it.

67
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,820
啊 人类在任何形态都一无是处！
Ugh. Humans in any form cannot be relied upon.

68
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,860
它活过来了！
It's alive!

69
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,280
糟了！
Scrap.

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,610
啊！看在老天爷的份上！又怎么了？
Oh, for the love of-- Now what?

71
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,050
我早就告诉你了
I tried to tell you before.

72
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,730
这是合成能量的副作用 他耗光了自身原本的能量
It's a side effect of the synth-en. He's burned through his own natural reserves.

73
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,290
那或许我们该把注射的事先缓缓
Then perhaps we should withhold any infusions for a while.

74
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,810
也许这样能让塞拉斯冷静下来
Might calm Cylas down a bit.

75
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,320
让他更听话一些
Make him a tad more manageable.

76
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,230
需要…能量…
Need... energon.

77
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,450
啊 你觉得他真的想…
Ah! Do you think he's actually trying to...

78
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,310
用那玩意把我们的能量吸干？
Suck out our energon with that thing?

79
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,240
看起来是这么回事！
Sure seems that way.

80
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,190
啊！啊！啊！
Ah! Ah! Ah!...

81
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,470
试试看你能不能拖住他！
See if you can hold him off!

82
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,860
啥？
You! What?

83
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,350
带上我！
Wait for me!

84
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,410
我们必须…拉响警报！
We need to sound the alarm!

85
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,500
绝对不行！威震天一定会认为这是我们的错！
Out of the question! Megatron will undoubtedly hold us responsible.

86
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,800
可这…本来就是啊！
But... we are.

87
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,620
其实 大部分是你的错！
Well, you are, mostly.

88
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,080
无论如何 陛下没必要知道这些！
Anyway, his lordship doesn't need to know that.

89
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,300
只要我们能摆平这个烂摊子
Not if we handle this the right way.

90
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,530
怎么摆平？
Meaning?

91
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,880
动动脑子 击倒！
Use your head, Knock out.

92
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,270
这艘船满是训练有素的士兵 个个装备精良
This ship is crawling with highly trained Vehicon troopers, armed for combat.

93
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,710
一旦塞拉斯想吸食他们 他们会帮我们干掉他
The moment Cylas attempts to feed, they will neutralize him for us.

94
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,600
问题也就迎刃而解了
Problem solved.

95
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,570
啊！
Aah!...

96
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,980
一旦我们找回塞拉斯的尸体 必须赶紧毁尸灭迹！
Once we recover Cylas' body, We must dispose of it as quickly and efficiently as possible.

97
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,400
不能留下一块碎片！
No trace of him can be allowed to remain.

98
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,120
他那被感…感…感染的尸体
His... Infected body...

99
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,540
- 啊！\N- 哇啊！
- Ah!?\N- Aah!

100
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,940
死了 能量被完全吸干了
Gone. Completely drained of energon.

101
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,920
跟我说说 红蜘蛛
Tell me something, starscream.

102
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,760
当你说“问题迎刃而解”时 你考虑到这种情况了么？
When you said "problem solved," is this even close to what you had in mind?

103
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,070
注意你的语气 击倒！
I do not appreciate your tone, knock out!

104
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,520
这场祸可不是我惹出来的！
This brewing catastrophe is hardly my fault.

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,820
那肯定也不是我惹出来的！
Well, it certainly isn't mine!

106
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,570
不是？是你自作聪明 拿人造能量做实验的！
Oh, no? You're the mastermind who chose to experiment with synthetic Energon.

107
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,630
是你怂恿我往里面加料的！
And you're the monkey wrench who thought it was a good idea to dabble in voodoo!

108
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,710
能量…
Energon.

109
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,490
- 啊！\N- 哇啊！
- Ah!\N- Ah!

110
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,650
你不是说他的火种都没了么？
I thought you said he had no spark?

111
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,820
是黑暗能量 它能使死者复生！
Dark energon, it re-animates the dead!

112
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,780
打它的头！
Aim for the head!

113
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,600
啥？你怎么知道？
What? How do you know?

114
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,970
我看过人类的恐怖电影
I have seen human horror films!

115
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,690
在汽车影院！
At drive-in theatres!

116
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,790
啊！打头没用 瞄准他的火种！
Ah! Forget the head. Go for the spark!

117
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,520
我们切断了他汲取黑暗能量的通道
We severed its link to the dark energon.

118
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,290
看人类的恐怖电影完全是浪费时间！
Human horror films, waste of time.

119
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,880
能量…
Energon...

120
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,200
如果被咬一口就会感染变异 那么全体船员都有危险！
If the mutation can be passed along with a single bite, The entire crew is at risk.

121
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,440
怎么着？你是说塞拉斯会弄出更多的僵尸来？
Heh!? You're saying Cylas could beget more Terrorcons?

122
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,440
（Terrocon 僵尸 在G1动画中翻译为龙头部队）
Heh!? You're saying Cylas could beget more Terrorcons?

123
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,980
极有可能
Mm, could happen.

124
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,070
（Terrocon 僵尸 在G1动画中翻译为龙头部队）
And the ensuing feeding frenzy could turn this entire warship into a scrap heap.

125
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,070
而随之而来的再扩散 会把整艘飞船变成一个废铁场！
And the ensuing feeding frenzy could turn this entire warship into a scrap heap.

126
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,100
所以 我现在能拉响警报了吧？
So now can we sound the alarm?

127
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,400
你们几个！有没有在这个区域发现什么…
You, there... have you noticed any unusual activity...

128
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,900
…不寻常的情况？
in... this... sector?

129
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,100
我的个娘呀！
- Ah!\N- Ah...!

130
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,290
啊！啊！
- Aah!\N- Let's go!

131
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,800
快进去！
In here!

132
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,720
击倒 眼前的情况可能比我们想象的要恐怖得多
Knockout, this situation might be a bit more dire than either of us ever imagined.

133
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,730
嗯 真是讽刺 和汽车人火拼了这么多年
Mm. I find it rather ironic that after battling Autobots all these years

134
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,630
被砸晕…被击中…被炸飞…
getting smacked down... shot at... blown up...

135
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,890
到头来却摊上了这么个死法
This is how our lights go out.

136
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,850
被吸干宝贵的能量而死…
Drained of our precious fluids.

137
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,980
如果今天真是我们的末日\N如果我们真要成为僵尸的口粮
If this is indeed the end, If we are to become Terrorcon chow

138
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,900
我想说 很荣幸能和你一起为威震天陛下尽忠…
It has been an honor serving Lord Megatron with you...

139
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:30,090
虽然你不像打击那么阳刚\N但我得承认我一直很欣赏你那光鲜的涂装
You're no Breakdown. Though I must confess... I have always admired your lustrous finish.

140
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,450
咳咳 那么…
Well, then...

141
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,300
该出去了
We should be going.

142
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,340
啊！
Ah!

143
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,010
你们两个谁能告诉我 到底发生什么事了？
Would either of you like to tell me what exactly is going on?!

144
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,890
呃…当然是…啥事都没发生 我的君王
Y-yes. Absolutely nothing, my liege.

145
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,140
一切都很正常 太正常了 几乎可以说是无聊了
All is quiet... too quiet. One could even say "dull."

146
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,630
是嘛 那为什么我火种内的黑暗能量正蠢蠢欲动？
Funny... because the Dark Energon within my spark has been pulsing.

147
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,020
还是让我来处理吧
Allow me to handle this.

148
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,230
这都是击倒的错！
It's Knockout's fault!

149
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,900
完全正确…啥？！
Precisely my... What?!

150
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,190
他调了一杯“黑暗”加“人造”能量鸡尾酒 给塞拉斯打进去了
He infused Cylas with a cocktail comprised of Dark and synthetic Energon

151
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,960
制造出了一个变异怪物 现在它会把整船人变成吸食能量的僵尸
creating a monstrous mutation, which is now on the verge of turning your entire crew into mindless Energon-sucking Terrorcons!

152
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,570
我不知道你鬼话连篇地又在抽什么疯 红蜘蛛
I do not know from what madness your yarn springs, Starscream.

153
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,670
但要是再让我发现 你乱动我的黑暗能量
but if I learn that you have been dabbling with my Dark Energon stores again

154
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,250
并试图给自己注射这种强大的力量
attempting to infuse yourself with its formidable power...

155
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,820
呃 我的君王…
Uh, my liege?

156
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:50,700
这么说吧 你得到的宽恕\N已经比历史上任何一个霸天虎都多了！
let me just say, you have been awarded more chances for redemption than anyone in Decepticon history!

157
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,800
能量…
Energon...

158
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,880
嘿！你！你在干什么！
Hey, you there. What are you doing?

159
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,390
我命令你 退下！
I order you... stand down!

160
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,260
我们刚才就想告诉您来着
We did try to tell you.

161
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,280
没错
Mm-hmm.

162
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,500
那为什么我无法让那些怪物服从我的命令？
Then why can I not command the monster to follow my bidding?

163
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,820
黑暗能量本应让您能控制这些食尸鬼的
While the trace of Dark Energon should have granted you control over these ghouls

164
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,630
我觉得或许是合成能量破坏了您和他们之间的联系
I believe the synthetic component may be corrupting your link to them.

165
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
启动紧急警报
Initiate high alert.

166
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,430
命令全体士兵与变异者保持距离 并对其格杀勿论！
Instruct all troops to keep their distance from the mutations and terminate on sight.

167
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,310
但你们俩的死活还要看接下来的表现
Your fate, however, remains to be seen.

168
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,410
还傻站在这里干什么？！
Why are you still here?!

169
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,830
去找到你们创造的鬼东西 然后立即给我把它灭了！
Find this creation of yours and eradicate it... immediately!

170
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,390
我知道威震天陛下让我们干这个是为了惩罚我们
I realize lord Megatron's only doing this to punish us

171
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,670
但我们不是猎杀塞拉斯的合适人选啊
but how are we the best choice to hunt down Cylas?

172
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,980
我是说 为啥不派出他心爱的超级野兽机器战士？
I mean, why not deploy his beloved beast-machine supersoldier

173
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,810
毕竟他们才是什么终极猎人嘛
After all, it is supposed to be the ultimate hunter.

174
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,350
绝对不行！
Out of the question.

175
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,620
如果巨狰狞被感染了 你能想象到那个情景吗？
Can you imagine if the Predacon became infected?

176
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,640
那就没什么能阻挡它了
Nothing could stop it.

177
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,400
能量…
Energon.

178
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,040
噢
Ah!

179
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,470
打击？
Breakdown?

180
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,480
我上次不是把你干掉了么？
Did I not exterminate you once already?

181
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,250
…能量…
Energon!

182
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,170
事不过二 哼！
Second time's the charm. Heh!

183
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,600
不过 保险起见…我要把你的火种挖出来！
But to be certain... I shall remove your very spark.

184
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,230
啊？！塞拉斯？
Ah?! Cylas?

185
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,860
他们对你做了什么？
What ever have they done to you?

186
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,710
更重要的是 谢谢你放我出来
Ah, but more importantly, thank you for freeing me.

187
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,400
不 谢谢你
No. Thank... you...

188
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,640
随你怎么说
Whatever.

189
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,620
机器昆虫们 听我号令
Insecticons, heed me.

190
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,790
…听我号令…
Heed me. Heed me.

191
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,090
刀锋女王归来了
Your Queen has returned.

192
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,420
咱们的噩梦终于结束了
Our ordeal is finally over!

193
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,020
或者刚刚开始
Or not.

194
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,490
见鬼了！
Scrap!

195
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,570
红蜘蛛！你找到瘟疫的源头了吗？
Starscream! Have you made contact with the plague bringer?

196
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,990
事实上 我的君王 有个好消息
Actually, my liege, I have good news.

197
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,310
还有个坏消息
And... bad news.

198
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,220
忠实的奴仆们 时机已经到来
Loyal servants, the time is now.

199
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,580
消灭所有霸天虎！
Lay waste to all Decepticons!

200
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,880
让他们尸骨无存！
Leave no trace of them in your wake!

201
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,000
声波！
Soundwave!

202
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,740
我在此立誓 我要让全世界都听到你的哀嚎！
I vow that on this day, the world will hear the sound of your screams!

203
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,950
上！
Ha!

204
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,970
不！
Nooo!

205
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:06,610
是的 根据你的建议 阻止传染扩散的程序已开始实施
Yes. The containment protocol you recommended to prevent any further outbreak is now under way.

206
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,180
此外 震荡波 鉴于这次事件让我们损失过半
Oh, and, Shockwave, having just lost more than half our military might

207
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,620
你的巨狰狞计划就变得至关重要
I cannot stress enough the importance of Project Predacon.

208
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,220
试一试能否加速其进程 好吗？
See if you can... speed things along, will you?

209
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,940
击倒 我要提醒你 作为船上的医疗官
Knockout, need I remind you that, as the ship's medic

210
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,590
你的上级是震荡波 不是红蜘蛛
you report directly to Shockwave, not Starscream.

211
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,300
明白了 主人
Understood, Master.

212
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:38,200
保险起见 即刻将你手上的所有项目移交给震荡波
Just to be sure, you will hand over all of your projects to him immediately

213
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,200
包括人造能量项目
including this synthetic Energon.

214
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,470
如您所愿 我的君王
As you wish, my liege.

215
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,830
至于你嘛…
And as for you...

216
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,720
威震天陛下 请容小人解释一下…
Lord Megatron, if you will just allow me to explain things...

217
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,770
不 还是让我解释一下
No. Allow me to explain things...

218
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,520
用一种你能听懂的方式
in a manner which I know you'll understand.

219
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,810
女王陛下 我们期待着您的命令
Your Majesty, we await your command.

220
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,690
过来 侍奉你的女王
Approach me. Serve your Queen.
