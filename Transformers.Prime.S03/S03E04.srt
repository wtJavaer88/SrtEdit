1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,940
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,540
你眼前的样本是在实验室中培养的
The specimen you see before you was bred in the laboratory

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,440
是由我在塞博特恩挖掘出的化石克隆而来
Cloned from fossilized remains, Which I discovered on Cybertron.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,640
龙？虎子什么时候弄到了一条龙？
A dragon? Where'd the 'cons get a dragon?

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,240
通天晓？很荣幸见到您
Ultra Magnus? It's an honor.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,140
要说 很荣幸见到您“长官”！
"it's an honor, sir."

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,240
我们必须阻止威震天 无论擎天柱在与不在
We must stop Megatron. With or without Optimus Prime.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,140
是谁让这个垫肩男当家的？
Who put shoulderpads in command?

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,340
通天晓是唯一合乎逻辑的人选
Ultra Magnus is the only logical choice.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,740
擎天柱 我拿到卓天越之锤了
Optimus! I have the forge!

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,140
它残余的能量必须用于复苏塞博特恩
Whatever power remains... must be used to restore Cybertron.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,440
新领袖诞生的时刻已经到来！
The time for a new leader is upon us.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,540
我坚信他此刻就站在我面前！
I believe that leader... stands before me right now.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,840
汽车人们
Autobots.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,040
目前我们在人数上仍然处于劣势 抛开弹药情况不谈
We remain vastly outnumbered, and, despite our munitions

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,440
我们也缺乏足够的火力去摧毁霸天虎的堡垒
Do not currently possess the firepower necessary to compromise the Decepticon citadel.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,440
山姆大叔的军队倒是有足够的火力
Uncle sam's military does.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,940
但我无权调动 否则威震天的巨炮会把华盛顿夷为平地
I just can't let them make a move as long as Megatron's ray guns are pointed at washington.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,340
那么首先我们必须潜入黑山堡垒 摧毁那些融合加农炮
Then we must infiltrate darkmount, in order to nullify its fusion cannons.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,640
不幸的是 那座堡垒屏蔽了所有未经授权的环陆桥出口
Unfortunately, it seems the fortress is heavily shielded against unauthorized groundbridges.

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,140
即使霸天虎自己的环陆桥技术也不例外
Even those originating from Decepticon technology.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,740
看来我们得从敌人眼皮底下硬闯了
Guess we'll have to sneak past enemy lines.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,440
以雷霆救援队的方式
Wrecker-style.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,040
早在塞博特恩时 我就难以接受你们的行为
I couldn't deal with "wrecker-style" back on Cybertron

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,240
所以现在我仍不会批准
and I refuse to deal with it here.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,840
哼
Hmm.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,040
我们需要尽可能地将霸天虎调离老巢 以增加胜算
Now, we require a means of thinning the Decepticon ranks to even the odds

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,440
只有这样才有希望完成这次任务
If we're to have any hope of completing this mission...

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,440
或者说 幸存下来
or of surviving it.

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
我…我做不到
I-I can't do this.

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,040
我是说 没错 谁不想当领袖呢？
I mean, sure, who wouldn't wanna be a prime?

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,240
但我真的还没有做好准备 去承担那种责任
But I'm really not ready for that kind of responsibility.

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,540
烟幕…
Smokescreen...

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,440
你无权作出选择 我也一样…
The choice is neither yours, nor mine to make.

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,740
当时机到来时…
When it is time...

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:12,040
领导模块会在它所认可的火种面前现身
The matrix of leadership will present itself only to one whose spark is worthy.

37
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
这个方法上次效果不错
Because it worked so well last time...

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,240
我就知道人类控制不住使用移动通讯设备的欲望
I knew the humans couldn't resist using their telecommunications.

39
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,040
他们似乎干什么都离不开它
That is all they seem to do.

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,940
找到他 加以消灭
Seek and destroy!

41
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,240
有五个虎子正向杰克的位置集结
I have five bogeys converging right on top of jack.

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
不再是了
Not anymore.

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
神子 该你出场了
Miko, your turn.

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,440
你好 我要两个大号披萨
Hello, I need two large pies

45
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,740
西西里口味
Sicilian.

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,940
你们能送餐吧？
You deliver, right?

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,240
哼哼 人类啊
Hm hm ha ha ha... Humans.

48
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,840
准备环陆桥
Standby to groundbridge.

49
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,540
声波
Soundwave

50
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,840
当你人品爆发时 咋就无法接受它呢？
why can't you accept a little good fortune?

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,640
汽车人不可能永远跟我们躲猫猫
The Autobots couldn't possibly stay hidden forever.

52
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
我真的很想吃那个披萨
I really could have used that pizza.

53
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,740
我已经接入霸天虎的通讯网络了
I've tapped into the Decepticon communications network.

54
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,140
杰克 你准备好了吗？
Are you ready, Jack?

55
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,540
咳咳 霸天虎指挥中心 收到请回答？
Decepticon command, do you read me?

56
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,440
我觉得还不够逼真
I remain unconvinced.

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,340
我会用静电伪装 使其以假乱真
I will enhance your performance with static.

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
霸天虎指挥中心 请回答 我们正遭受汽车人的进攻！
Decepticon command, do you read? We are under autobot attack!

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,640
那里是我们的能量矿！
It's one of our energon mines!

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
机器昆虫 做好战斗准备！
Insecticons, prepare for battle!

61
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,540
汽车人们 子弹上膛！
Autobots, lock and load!

62
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,240
把引擎都给我开着 小伙子们
Keep your engines warm, boys.

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,140
一旦我们接到通天晓的信号 就立即出发！
We launch the moment Ultra Magnus gives the all-clear.

64
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,240
红蜘蛛指挥官 信息有误
There must be some mistake, commander Starscream.

65
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,140
矿工们并未遭受攻击
The mine is not under attack.

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,140
- 什么？怎么可能？\N- 红蜘蛛！
What? How can that--? Starscream!

67
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,440
解释一下为什么我的军队目前散落在全球各地？
Explain why my forces are scattering across this globe.

68
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,940
是那些该死的汽车人搞的鬼 威震天陛下
Uh, renegade Autobot mischief, lord Megatron!

69
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,540
我仍在分析他们是如何侵入我们的通讯系统\N却没有触发…
I am in the process of deducing how they are infiltrating our communications systems without the base of--

70
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,240
先驱号！
The Harbinger!

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,640
你竟把一艘能正常运行的霸天虎飞船\N丢在那里不管不顾？
You left abandoned Decepticon technology fully operational and unsecured?

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,740
呃…请允许我 立即去弥补自己的疏忽
Allow me to correct my oversight immediately.

73
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,040
追踪者部队到飞行甲板集合
Seeker armada to the flight deck.

74
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,040
（Seeker 追踪者 G1里是霸天虎喷气机部队的统称 近代作品中泛指霸天虎的空中部队）
Seeker armada to the flight deck.

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,640
（Seeker 追踪者 G1里是霸天虎喷气机部队的统称 近代作品中泛指霸天虎的空中部队）
Your target is the Decepticon ship, the Harbinger.

76
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,640
你们的目标是霸天虎飞船――先驱号
Your target is the Decepticon ship, the Harbinger.

77
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,140
立即去把它轰成渣！
You are to obliterate it, at once!

78
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,840
我的大军已经就位
My armada is in position.

79
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,540
打开通向先驱号的环陆桥
Open a groundbridge to the Harbinger.

80
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,240
看来黑山堡垒目前正遭受攻击
Since it would seem that darkmount is under attack

81
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,840
调集所有留守力量 消灭入侵者
kindly redirect all efforts toward ensuring that our invaders our eradicated!

82
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
再吃我一颗！
Fire in another hole!

83
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,040
我向您保证 我的主人
I assure you, master

84
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,540
一切都在我的掌控之中
I have everything under control.

85
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,140
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

86
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,540
我承认军事行动并非我的专长
I accept that military considerations are outside of my domain

87
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,040
但似乎再次释放巨狰狞的时机已到
But perhaps it is once again time... to release the Predacon.

88
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,440
救护车 动手！
Ratchet, now!

89
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
这下可好
Oh, well...

90
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,740
对 去吧 找个没人的地方生闷气吧
Yes, that's right. Go off and sulk, why don't you?

91
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,440
是谁站在我的面前？
Who stands before me?

92
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,340
什么？是我啊 擎天柱
What? It's me, Optimus.

93
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,740
我是烟幕
Smokescreen.

94
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,940
谁…在召唤我…
Who... beckons...?

95
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
来吧 擎天柱
Come, Optimus.

96
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,540
真的是您吗？
Is it truly you...

97
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,240
钛师傅
Alpha Trion?

98
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,040
既然我出现在你面前 我的高徒
I stand before you, my student.

99
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,940
说明你的大限将至
As such, it would seem that it is your time.

100
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
你为何有所犹豫？
Why do you hesitate?

101
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,640
我并非畏惧回归火种源
I do not fear joining with the allspark

102
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,840
但是…我担忧领导模块的归属
but for the fate of the matrix of leadership.

103
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,840
你我都了然于心 一位优秀的人选就在眼前
You know as well as I, a worthy candidate is near.

104
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,640
他会成长为一名合格的领袖 就像当初的你一样
One who will learn to be a prime, as you once did.

105
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,240
通天晓呼叫突击小队
Ultra Magnus to stealth team.

106
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,340
汇报目前状况
Status report.

107
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
任务轻微受阻
Having a little trouble reaching the objective.

108
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,240
守卫比预想的要多 长官！
Security is tighter than anticipated, sir.

109
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,340
继续拖住他们！
Keep them occupied.

110
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
通天晓
Ultra Magnus.

111
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,940
让我猜猜 你想毁掉融合炮的能量核心 使其瘫痪
Allow me to venture: You intend to disarm my fusion cannons by disabling their power core.

112
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,740
没错 威震天
Indeed, Megatron

113
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
而你正挡在我的路上
and you are standing in my way.

114
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,040
你们的行动毫无逻辑可言
Your mission was most illogical.

115
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,740
糟糕！
Scrap.

116
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,040
通天晓…
Ultra Magnus.

117
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,440
你毕竟不是擎天柱
You are no Optimus Prime.

118
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,840
看在保罗・里维尔坐骑的份儿上 怎么这么久还没消息？
What in the name of Paul Revere's Horse is taking them so long?

119
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,840
（Paul Revere 保罗・里维尔 美国革命战争中因策马狂奔传递警报而闻名）
What in the name of Paul Revere's Horse is taking them so long?

120
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,940
所有入侵者都已被捕 主人
All invaders have been taken captive, master.

121
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
但并没有发现擎天柱的踪迹
There was no sign of Optimus Prime.

122
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,840
那么 告诉我 指挥官
So tell me, commander...

123
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,640
你们的首领到底在哪儿？
Where might your leader be?

124
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,740
握紧我的手 擎天柱 与我重聚
Take my hand, Optimus, and join me.

125
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,040
回归火种源吧
Join with the allspark.

126
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,940
擎天柱 不！
Optimus, no!

127
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,740
故事不该以这种结局收场
This isn't how the story's supposed to end.

128
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,140
我不会再问第二遍
I will not ask again!

129
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,340
即使我知道 也不会告诉你
If I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

130
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,940
很好
Very well.

131
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,340
处死所有的俘虏 启动融合炮攻击射程内最近的大型城市
Execute our prisoners, and fire each cannon at the nearest metropolis within its sites.

132
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,140
我要让整个宇宙知道 这颗星球是属于我威震天的
It is time to show the known universe that this planet belongs to Megatron.

133
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,240
主人 有不明物体接近
Master, something's coming!

134
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,740
巨狰狞？
Predacon?

135
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,540
嗯…长得没那么邪乎
Hm... not beasty enough.

136
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,940
这怎么可能？
How is that possible?

137
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,040
什么？
What?

138
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,840
一个汽车人信号 但却是个飞行单位？
An Autobot signal. But it's airborne.

139
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,440
我认识那个涂装
I know that color scheme.

140
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,540
等等！他不会飞啊 难道不是吗？
Wait! He can't fly! Can he?

141
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
指挥官？
Commander?

142
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,340
长官 您看起来…强壮无比
Sir, you're looking... robust.

143
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,140
我们的当务之急是瘫痪下面的融合加农炮
It is paramount that we disable the fusion cannons below.

144
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,840
明白了
Understood.

145
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,440
全员注意 擎天柱回归了
All units... Optimus Prime has returned.

146
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,940
- 太棒了！\N- 好极了！\N- 感谢火种源！

我重复一遍 擎天柱还活着 并且状态极佳
I repeat, Prime is alive and quite well.

148
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,940
好哎！
Yes!

149

指挥官 大量敌对信号迫近！
Commander, a cluster of enemy signals, incoming!

151
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,440
哼 人类！
Ah! Humans.

152
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,540
启动融合加农炮！
Activate the fusion cannons!

153
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,540
空中霸王战机 等待我的指令
Sky Strikers, await my command.

154
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,540
（Sky Striker 空中霸王 孩之宝旗下\N另一品牌G.I.Joe里面特种部队方面的主力战机）
Sky Strikers, await my command.

155
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,740
威――震――天！
Megatron

156
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,940
给我消失吧！

157
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,940
汽车人们 撤离该地区
Autobots, clear the area.

158
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,440
动手吧！
Let's do this.

159
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,740
声波 请求开启环陆桥
Soundwave, I require a groundbridge.

160
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,540
把威震天陛下转移到战舰上去
Transport lord Megatron to the warship.

161
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
你在干什么！
What are you doing?

162
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,040
不！我们绝不撤退！
No! We will not retreat!

163
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,140
我们已经输掉了这场战斗 我的君王
This battle is lost, my liege.

164
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,940
如果我们还想有翻盘的机会 现在必须撤退！
We must retreat if we are to have any hope of winning the war.

165
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,940
啊！我错过正戏了！
Aw, I missed it!

166

我谨代表美国总统和美军联合参谋本部

感谢你们在守卫这颗星球时所表现出的大无畏精神
I thank you all for your selfless heroism in defense of this planet.

168
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,040
非常遗憾 你们的杰出贡献仍无法被公诸于世
I'm sorry the world can't know of your undying dedication

169
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,240
但对我个人来说 我欠你们一条命 一份自由 还有一个未来
because I, for one, owe you my life, my liberty, and my future.

170
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,740
长官 我非常荣幸地将汽车人的指挥权交还给您

173
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
好吧 这句话我憋了好久了
Okay, someone's gotta say it.

174
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
擎天柱2.0版酷毙了！
Optimus 2.0 is rad!

175
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,240
想想卓天越之锤可以把你们改成什么样
Imagine what the forge could do for your bod.

176
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,340
卓天越之锤的能量真的完全耗尽了吗？
Is it true that the forge has been drained of its power?

177
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,340
那么重铸终极之锁已经彻底无望了
Then any hope of rebuilding the Omega Lock has truly been lost.

178
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,240
我…我做了自己认为对的事
I did what I felt was right.

179
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,040
那么你再次证明了你的直觉是正确的
And your instincts have again proven to be quite sound.

180
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,140
耶！
Yeah!
