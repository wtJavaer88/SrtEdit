1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,360
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,260
震荡波 我以为你已经在塞博特恩阵亡了
Shockwave... I thought you'd perished on Cybertron.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,460
接入器没能取得任何关于汽车人行踪的新信息
The patch failed to yield any new information on the whereabouts of the Autobots.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,860
不管在哪里 我都听得出这引擎声！
I' d know the hum of that engine anywhere.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,160
老千！
Jackie!

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,860
我们不能就这么放弃了！
We can't just give up!

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,360
那么你告诉我 我们还能做什么！
Then tell me what we can do!

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,660
我们知道红蜘蛛在其单独行动期间 使用过环陆桥
We know Starscream had access to a groundbridge.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,160
他利用了霸天虎的废弃飞船 先驱号
He'd clearly been using the Harbinger.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,460
那上面可能装满了各种塞博特恩资源
It could be full of Cybertronian tech.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,160
物资再多又能怎么样
Resources won't be of much use

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,060
如果没有人来…领导我们
not without someone to lead us.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,960
…铸锤
The Forge.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,660
如果你有了卓天越之锤 就能自我修复了
If you had the Forge, you could fix yourself up!

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,560
来见见通天晓
Meet Ultra Magnus.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,360
很荣幸向您展示 我的君王
I present to you, my liege

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,660
终极汽车人猎手！
the ultimate Autobot hunter.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,060
巨狰狞！
A Predacon.

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,660
他们不是在史前塞博特恩就已经灭绝了吗！
They've been extinct since the beginning of Cybertronian history.

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,960
的确
Indeed.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,560
但你眼前的样本是在实验室中培育的
But the specimen you see before you was bred in the laboratory

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,860
是由我在塞博特恩挖掘出的化石克隆而来
cloned from fossilized remains, which I discovered on Cybertron.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,360
震荡波 能再次见到你的旷世杰作令我非常愉悦
Shockwave, it does my spark good to see you once again tampering with creation.

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
主人 请不要靠得太近！
Master, please! Keep your distance!

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,060
无须紧张 这头野兽已完全在我的掌控之中
No need for alarm. The beast is completely under my control.

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,760
好个原始而雄壮的力量！
Such primal magnificence.

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:06,160
这是千斤顶受审时溢出的汽车人能量液样本
A sample of Energon, from Wheeljack, spilled during the Autobot's failed interrogation.

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,960
那么 开始狩猎吧…
Let the hunt begin.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,160
伙计们 把那些破烂轰上天我完全没意见
Guys, you know I'm all for blowin' the scrap outta stuff

30
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,860
但炸平一个虎子的能量矿\N对我们重组乐队或干掉威震天有帮助吗？
but what does flattening a Decepticon mine have to do with getting the band back together and taking down Megatron?

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,360
答案很简单 这里被引爆时一定是火光冲天
Simple. When we light up this place, the blast'll be big and unmistakable.

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,560
五百公里内的汽车人\N都会注意到爆炸的光芒并尽快赶来的
Any Autobot within 500 klicks will see the sky glowin' with Energon, and come runnin'.

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
那就动手吧！
Then bring the rain.

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,660
主机已经运转起来了
Mainframe's up and running.

35
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,760
不过我需要你帮忙破译它的操作代码
But I'll need help hacking the operating codes.

36
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,960
就算环陆桥能够正常运转
Even if the groundbridge proves functional

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,060
无法锁定其他汽车人的坐标也是枉然
it will be next to worthless without a means of pinpointing the current locations of our compatriots.

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,960
动动脑子 大黄蜂
Use your head, Bumblebee.

39
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,960
如果霸天虎能追踪汽车人的信号
If the Decepticons had the ability to track Autobot signals

40
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,360
那我们早就被威震天一网打尽了
we'd have all been at Megatron's mercy here on Earth a long time ago.

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,260
唉…功亏一篑
Ah... Back where we started.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,960
未必 如果我能调整这里的信息频率
But not if I can reconfigure these Decepticon frequencies.

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,560
或许我们能够使用虎子的通讯链
At the very least, we may be able to access their comm-link.

44
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,160
塞博特恩沦陷以后 就没人再见过你
No one's seen or heard from you since Cybertron went dark.

45
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,760
你是怎么到达地球的？
How did you find your way to Earth?

46
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,460
士兵 虽然我们已不在塞博特恩
Soldier, we may not be on Cybertron

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
但是军事条例依旧有效
but military protocol remains.

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,360
很抱歉 长官
My apologies, Sir.

49
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,860
长官？
Sir?

50
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,160
知会本地生命形态注意他的语气
Advise the native life-form to watch its tone as well.

51
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
什么？这谁啊？
What? Who is this guy?

52
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,060
通天晓是塞博特恩战争时期 擎天柱的首席副官
Ultra Magnus was Optimus' key Lieutenant during the war back on Cybertron.

53
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,760
极端教条主义 千万别顶撞他
Very "by the book". Just go with it.

54
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,960
对于你的问题
As for your broader question

55
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,760
我的经历和其他汽车人大同小异
my story is that of all Autobots since the exodus.

56
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,860
在被迫撤离家园以后 我徘徊在宇宙中搜寻同胞
I wandered the spaceways in search of others

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,860
但仅有少数人能够与我重聚
reuniting with some

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,960
更多的时候我只能眼看着他们惨遭霸天虎的毒手
often only to see them fall at the hands of the Decepticons.

59
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,560
直到你接收到终极之光并跟随它来到这里
Until you detected the Omega beam, and followed it here.

60
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,860
如果你指的是由塞博特恩发射出的高强度能量束
If you are referring to the massive energy burst originating from Cybertron

61
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,460
那么你说对了
that would be affirmative.

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
当到达这个星球时 我发现它已然遭到霸天虎的入侵
Upon my arrival, it became evident that this planet had been invaded.

63
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,260
但我的扫描器也同时探测到了多个汽车人的生命信号
My scanners also detected Autobot life signals

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,360
而你们是距离我最近的
yours being in closest proximity to my position.

65
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
多个信号？
Signals? As in plural?

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,860
长官
Sir.

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,860
总数五名
Five total.

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,460
但我们有七名汽车人
Out of seven.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,460
杰克 别一下子把事情往最坏处想
Jack, that doesn't necessarily mean what you're thinking.

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
没被探测到的信号 很可能是被什么东西屏蔽了
Autobot signals can't be detected when they're shielded.

71
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,460
小堡垒建得蛮舒适的嘛 威震天
Cozy little place you built for yourself, Megatron.

72
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,560
找锤子估计要花些时间了
Finding the Forge in there may take awhile.

73
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,360
或者说…
Then, again

74
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,060
你仍会把贵重的东西藏在你的老地方…
maybe you still keep your valuables in the usual place.

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,460
我不会让你失望的 擎天柱
I won't let you down, Optimus.

76
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,660
啥 我小题大做？
I'm sorry, "overreacting?"

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,160
你说得倒轻巧 击倒！
Easy for you to say, Knockout.

78
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,160
这里可没人想抢你的职位
Nobody here wants your post.

79
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,060
而我就不同了 我身处所有霸天虎都梦寐以求的位置上
I, on the other hand, hold the most coveted position within the Decepticon ranks.

80
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,260
不管震荡波嘴上怎么说
And no matter what he may claim

81
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,860
但我知道他心里一直在盘算着篡我的权！
I know that Shockwave is plotting to usurp me!

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,960
当他给威震天陛下展示那头野兽时
Did you see the smug look in his eye

83
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,960
你瞧他那副小人得志的嘴脸！
when he unveiled that vile beast to lord Megatron?

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
我可不怕你 丑八怪！
You don't scare me, ugly.

85
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,760
你在这儿呢 美人儿！
Hello, beautiful.

86
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,860
炸药放置完毕
Munitions planted.

87
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,060
好戏这就开场了
Let's get this party started.

88
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
有人来了！
Company.

89
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,760
威震天？
Megatron?

90
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,460
不 是个更大的
Nah. Bigger.

91
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,860
我不记得铁桶头的马戏团里有这个小丑
And I don't remember seeing that move in buckethead's repertoire.

92
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,160
龙？
A dragon?

93
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,160
虎子什么时候弄到一条龙？
Where'd the 'Cons get a dragon?

94
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,860
- 龙是什么？\N- 龙是什么？
- What's a dragon?\N- What's a dragon?

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,960
会飞会喷火的大蜥蜴！
Giant flying fire-breathing lizard.

96
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,860
隔板 你没事吧？
Bulkhead, you okay?

97
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,360
小心烫手 我可是刚出炉的
Easy, I may be hot to the touch.

98
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,360
它怎么不追我们了？
Why isn't it coming after us?

99
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,760
怪物 找我呢？
Lookin' for me, beast?

100
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,760
老子在此！
I'm right here.

101
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,060
我们需要更强大的火力！
We're gonna need more firepower!

102
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,460
那你算找对人了！
Good thing I know just where to find some!

103
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,260
敌军来袭！
Incoming!

104
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,860
是汽车人！
Autobots!

105
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,860
这下还不活埋了它
And the walls came tumblin' down.

106
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,360
没错！闷死那条该死的龙！
Yes! Snuff the tragic dragon!

107
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,360
这下玩完了！
We're toast.

108
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
我们的人？
One of ours?

109
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
是又怎样？
Does it matter?

110
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
- 杰克！\N- 阿尔茜！
- Jack!\N- Arcee!

111
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,760
神子 我喘不过气了
Miko. Can't breathe.

112
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,060
真是阿弱！
Weakling.

113
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,960
谢谢你的援手
Thanks for the save.

114
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,360
要谢就谢指挥官吧
Thank the Commander.

115
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,860
战士们
Soldiers.

116
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,260
是你？
You?

117
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,660
通天晓？很荣幸见到您
Ultra Magnus? It's an honor.

118
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,560
要说 很荣幸见到您 “长官”！
It's an honor, Sir.

119
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,160
是我制造的大爆炸把你们引来的吧
Guess blowin' that mine made us pretty easy to spot.

120
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
通天晓已经追踪到你们的信号了
Ultra Magnus already had a bead on your signals

121
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
还有我们的
and ours.

122
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,160
介不介意解释一下那只跟屁虫到底是什么东西？
Care to tell us what exactly's nipping at our tailpipes?

123
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,260
我们觉得那是一只机器龙
We think it's a robot dragon.

124
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,460
或者是某种塞博特恩爬行动物
Or a Cybertronian reptile.

125
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,260
全员注意！
Brace yourselves.

126
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,960
那家伙就在我们头顶
It's right on top of us.

127
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,460
又有何贵干？ 威震天“陛下”
What is it now, lord Megatron?

128
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,160
福勒探员 我是救护车
Agent Fowler, it's Ratchet!

129
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
救护车 杰克在哪儿？和你在一起吗？
Ratchet? Where's Jack? Is he with you?

130
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,360
不 他没和我在一起
No, he is not.

131
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,260
听着 我们时间有限
Listen, we don't have much time.

132
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,060
我正冒着无法估算的巨大风险和你联系
I have taken a tremendous, yet calculated, risk in contacting you.

133
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,560
希望虎子们没有疯狂地监控自己的通讯系统
Hopefully, the Decepticons are not monitoring their own frequencies as closely as they no doubt are those of the humans.

134
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,060
我现在把我们当前的坐标发送给你…
I am transmitting our current coordinates.

135
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,060
什么？
What?

136
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,660
救护车 你有其他人的消息吗？
Ratchet, have you heard from anyone else?

137
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
擎天柱怎么样了？
What about Prime?

138
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,960
是汽车人的飞船
It's one of ours!

139
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,460
拉夫！
Raf!

140
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,460
这丫头的劲儿不小吧？
Girl's got a grip, doesn't she?

141
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,560
你们都还活着！
You're alive.

142
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,560
通天晓！
Ultra Magnus?

143
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
医官
Doctor.

144
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,760
您一定大失所望吧 主人
What a grave disappointment this must be for you, master.

145
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,560
而更糟的是
And to make matters worse

146
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:35,860
由于巨狰狞言语不能 我们无法得知它为何失败得如此彻底
because it cannot speak, we have no way of knowing why the Predacon failed so miserably.

147
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,460
可怜的生物 又蠢又哑…
Poor, mute, mindless creature.

148
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,460
新喷涂看起来不错嘛 小蜂
New paint job looks good, Bee.

149
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,160
看来你很能自娱自乐嘛
At least you had something to work with.

150
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,160
如果换我的话 我一定会选粉色！
If I reversed my colors, I'd be pink.

151
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,060
我仍需进一步调校通信链 让它兼容汽车人的频率
The communications link needs further calibration to be compatible with Autobot frequencies.

152
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
但环陆桥已经可以正常运转了
The groundbridge, however, is fully operational.

153
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,660
这样逃跑就方便多了 等那只机器龙把我们当早餐吃的时候
That would've come in handy when robo-dragon was trying to eat us for breakfast.

154
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:10,460
这个星球的土著都这样目无纪律吗？
The indigenous population of this planet, do they all display the same disregard for authority?

155
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,160
不 基本上只有神子而已
No. Mostly just Miko.

156
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,060
不 别开枪！
No! Don't shoot!

157
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,960
那是福勒 他是我们这边的！
It's Fowler. He's with us!

158
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
没事了 妈妈 我很好
It's okay, mom. I'm fine.

159
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,260
你的家人很安全
Your families are safe.

160
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,560
福勒探员已经确保贾斯帕被及时疏散了
Agent Fowler saw to it that Jasper was evacuated in time.

161
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,960
通天晓所能识别的信号都在这里了
The only signals Ultra Magnus was able to isolate are standing right here.

162
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
可能他的扫描器出故障了
Maybe his scanner's faulty.

163
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,560
这么说 烟幕小子仍然下落不明
So the kid's unaccounted for.

164
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,860
当虎子进攻时 烟幕被环陆桥传送走了
Smokescreen bridged out unaccompanied.

165
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,260
只有擎天柱知道目的地
Only Optimus knows where.

166
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,060
当时擎天柱留下断后
And Optimus remained behind

167
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,060
他破坏了环陆桥 以确保每个人都安全撤离
to destroy the groundbridge, to ensure that everyone else... made it to safety.

168
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,260
我…亲眼见到基地被摧毁
I watched the base go down.

169
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,360
没有任何人或东西走出来
No one or thing walked out of there.

170
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,660
或许只是我们没看到
Not that we could see.

171
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,560
即使擎天柱幸存下来了
Even if Prime survived

172
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,860
我们也不能在这里坐等他的出现
I'm not sure we can afford to wait for him to show up.

173
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,360
尤其是威震天正趾高气昂地守在他的黑山老窝
Not with Megatron holding our planet hostage

174
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,960
并将我们整个星球挟为人质
from his high and mighty perch at Darkmount.

175
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,060
我倾向于本地生命形态的意见
I would be inclined to agree with the native life-form.

176
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,460
我们必须阻止威震天
We must stop Megatron

177
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,260
无论擎天柱在与不在
with or without Optimus Prime.

178
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
擎天柱
Optimus!

179
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,860
我拿到卓天越之锤了
I have The Forge.

180
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
你可以用它来修复自己！
You can use it to repair yourself!

181
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,760
这并非我让你取回这个圣物的本意
That is not the reason I had you retrieve the relic.

182
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,960
什么？我不明白
What? I don't understand.

183
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,760
卓天越之锤的力量 并非无穷无尽
The power of the Forge is not unlimited.

184
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,160
它的能量已接近干涸
Its energy has already begun to ebb.

185
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,160
它的能量是弱了些 那有什么关系！
So it's running low, who cares?

186
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,560
只要能把你治好就足够了！
All we need is enough juice to get you back into fighting shape!

187
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:28,260
它残余的能量必须用于修复终极之锁
Whatever power remains must be used to rebuild the Omega lock

188
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,260
以复苏塞博特恩
to restore Cybertron.

189
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,260
但那就意味着…
But that would mean...

190
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:44,360
我们种族的延续比我们任何一员的生命都更为重要…
The fate of all our kind is more vital... than that of any one of us.

191
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,360
…也包括我在内
... Including me.

192
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,860
我们必须竭尽所能 以推翻威震天的统治
We must do everything in our power to ensure Megatron's downfall

193
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,160
而此事只能智取
but we will need to be smart about it.

194
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,060
喔 是谁让这个垫肩男当家的？
Whoa, who put shoulderpads in command?

195
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,460
临时当家而已
Temporary command.

196
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,160
通天晓是唯一合乎逻辑的人选
Ultra Magnus is the only logical choice.

197
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,960
他曾在擎天柱麾下受训
He was trained by Optimus

198
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,560
并在塞博特恩之战时一直担任领导职位
and served as his commanding officer throughout the War For Cybertron.

199
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,460
如果没有其他人提出反对意见的话
Now, unless there is any further objection

200
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,260
战士们 跟我来
soldier, please, follow me.

201
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,360
遵命 头儿
Aye aye, Cap'n.

202
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,760
汽车人们
Autobots.

203
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,860
挑件趁手的家伙吧！
Take your pick.

204
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
现在你合我胃口了
Now you're speaking my language

205
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,460
长官！
Sir.

206
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,760
擎天柱 卓天越之锤是领袖的圣物
Optimus, the Forge is a relic of the Primes.

207
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,860
没有领袖 没有您 我们无法用它复苏塞博特恩！
We can't use it to restore Cybertron, not without a Prime. Not without you.

208
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,460
会有一位新领袖站出来的！
There will be a new Prime.

209
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,860
我们先把您治好 同时干掉威震天 然后再操心新领袖吧
You can worry about that after we get you patched up, and we take down Megatron.

210
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,960
新领袖诞生的时刻已然到来！
The time for a new leader is upon us.

211
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,960
以我火种之名
In my spark...

212
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,060
我坚信他此刻就站在我的面前！
I believe that leader... stands before me right now.
