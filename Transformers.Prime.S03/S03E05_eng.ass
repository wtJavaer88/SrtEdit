Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.54,0:05:44.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But we are fortunate that Smokescreen is inexperienced enough not to have followed protocol.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.69,0:05:52.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,There. I can see it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.87,0:05:58.79,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Abandon the excavation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.89,0:06:02.94,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Now.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.10,0:07:13.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It cannot be.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.07,0:07:16.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Be what?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.98,0:07:19.88,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The ancient remains...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.58,0:07:22.45,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,of a Predacon.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.75,0:07:34.25,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Though it remains unclear why such a skull would be found on your planet,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.62,0:07:40.82,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,its presence reveals all too much about the Predacon which Megatron recently sent in pursuit of us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.06,0:07:43.32,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You mean that dragon bot we put on ice?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.26,0:07:48.99,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Except that Predacons have been extinct since, well...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.99,0:07:51.94,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Since before most life began on Cybertron.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.65,0:07:54.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They're like Earth's dinosaurs.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.69,0:07:58.92,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Which means, for you guys, running into one would be like us meeting a T-Rex.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.71,0:08:01.71,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So then what were dinobots?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.71,0:08:03.06,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Totally different.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.26,0:08:08.22,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,With Megatron's seeming new interest in the excavation of prehistoric skeletons
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.84,0:08:12.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and a certain scientist back among the Decepticon ranks...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.94,0:08:14.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It would stand to reason
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.34,0:08:19.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,that Shockwave cloned the beast from one such find.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.90,0:08:22.43,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And now Megatron's looking to clone another.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.89,0:08:26.70,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What makes you think buckethead would stop at just one?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.59,0:08:30.23,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,We could have beast wars on our hands.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.59,0:08:34.41,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And if Shockwave only requires a single strand of CNA
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.41,0:08:36.43,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,from which to clone a beast...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.13,0:08:41.24,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,He already possesses what he needs to engender this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.99,0:08:45.71,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Autobots, we must become Beast Hunters.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.84,0:08:48.93,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,One thing still doesn't follow.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.23,0:08:51.67,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Predacons went extinct on Cybertron.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.70,0:08:53.97,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So what would their bones be doing here?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.18,0:08:56.54,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,On Earth?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.78,0:09:03.02,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, isn't it just a little preposterous?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.51,0:09:07.13,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They are not the remains of Predacons, Starscream.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.52,0:09:11.66,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But, rather, the remains of Predacon clones.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.30,0:09:17.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,For you see... Our recent Autobot hunter wasn't the first bestial super-soldier
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.84,0:09:21.46,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Shockwave ever attempted to breed from prehistoric matter.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.17,0:09:24.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,During the war for Cybertron,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.17,0:09:30.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I sanctioned the dispatch of a small army of these preda-clones to Earth
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.87,0:09:36.25,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,to unleash the beasts on unwitting Autobot forces stationed here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.56,0:09:38.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Once they accomplished their mission,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.08,0:09:42.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the surviving Predacons held sentinel on this very world
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.70,0:09:44.63,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,for ages to come,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.83,0:09:48.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,guarding the Energon reserves they had managed to secure
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.84,0:09:50.79,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,while awaiting my arrival.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.36,0:09:54.39,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course, our reunion here was much delayed,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.74,0:09:59.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and it would seem we lost the beasts to the ravages of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.08,0:10:02.16,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But not their endo-matter,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.43,0:10:06.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,from which I am logically able to extract their very CNA.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.17,0:10:10.23,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Pff. Another scavenger hunt?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.62,0:10:17.93,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,How logical would it really be to locate all the dusty remains of your former pets?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.11,0:10:22.88,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You are not suggesting that I would send my creations to a distant planet
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.88,0:10:25.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,without first having them... micro-chipped?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.38,0:10:29.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Eh... Well... well, I was.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.35,0:10:32.18,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But, seriously, you did?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.18,0:10:40.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,From our historical texts.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.91,0:10:45.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But those are metal versions of creatures from our Greek mythology and medieval literature.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.73,0:10:47.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Not dinosaurs.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.49,0:10:53.08,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It would stand to reason that Predacons did indeed walk upon this Earth in ancient times,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.78,0:10:58.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,as they seem to have been the basis for much of humankind's folklore.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.31,0:11:05.01,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Illustrating once again that the pasts of Earth and Cybertron are inextricably linked.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.71,0:11:20.54,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Synthetic Energon?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.87,0:11:21.70,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Indeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.23,0:11:27.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I am concerned that without access to any Energon reserves since our base was destroyed,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.56,0:11:31.41,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,our ability to deal with impending crises will be severely hampered.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.82,0:11:34.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,A wise decision, old friend.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.78,0:11:36.13,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Just, please...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.52,0:11:38.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,manage your expectations.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.99,0:11:42.41,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I am working with even more rudimentary hardware than before.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.46,0:11:47.21,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Prime! Satellite surveillance has picked up two signs of Decepticon activity:
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.27,0:11:49.71,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,one near an oil field outside of El Paso,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.72,0:11:52.07,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,the other near the Hebrides bluffs in Scotland.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.13,0:11:54.92,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So don't Forget to pack your kilts.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.84,0:11:57.93,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,We must divide our resources.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.06,0:12:01.57,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Ultra Magnus, lead the Wreckers to the bluffs.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.02,0:12:03.02,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes, Optimus.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.69,0:12:08.97,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Uh... What's a kilt?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.42,0:12:14.36,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Agent Fowler can, at times, be oblique.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.74,0:12:17.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I find it best to simply nod and mobilize.
