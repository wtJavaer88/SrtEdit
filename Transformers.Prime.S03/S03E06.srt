1
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,240
让震荡波在这艘飞船上整出一支野兽大军
Is it really wise for Shockwave to spawn an army of beasts

2
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,350
凭这狭小的实验室 似乎不太明智吧
here in this laboratory, or within any part of this warship?

3
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,980
我是说 光是以前的那只 飞船就已经容不下了
I mean, not even the lone beast we had was compact enough

4
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,590
它在走廊里闲逛几乎能把墙给拆了
to stroll these corridors without tearing them asunder.

5
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,900
说到它 你可要节哀啊
Which reminds me, I am so very sorry for your loss.

6
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,330
我将使用我的外部实验室
I was referring to my offsite laboratory

7
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,630
那是我特地为这项克隆程序准备的
which we have erected expressly for the cloning procedures.

8
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,960
就没有你考虑不到的 是吧？
You think of everything, don't you?

9
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,040
我们遭到了攻击
We are under attack.

10
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,990
汽车人？
Autobots?

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
不合逻辑
Illogical.

12
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,870
但我确实在飞船顶部探测到一个体型巨大的物体
Though there appears to be an enormous mass upon the upper hull.

13
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,540
它是怎么找到我们的？
How did it find us?

14
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,840
巨狰狞有精确的归巢本能
Predacons possess precise homing instincts.

15
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,550
以及惊人的生存能力
And astonishing resilience.

16
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,790
红蜘蛛 这只巨狰狞交给你指挥了
Starscream, assume command of my beast.

17
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,400
我？主人？
Me, master?

18
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,990
我是说 我怎好意思从它的创造者那里夺走这份殊荣呢？
I... I mean, I wouldn't dream of seizing such an honor from its very creator.

19
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,150
将巨狰狞交由军事部门管辖是符合逻辑的
Military command of the Predacon is most logical

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,830
鉴于我将全身心投入研究领域
since my services are required elsewhere.

21
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,080
好了 野兽猎人们 根据情报
All right, Beast Hunters. According to our intel

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,230
霸天虎将在正下方位置挖掘巨狰狞的骸骨
the Decepticons should be excavating for Predacon bones directly beneath us.

23
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,380
我上了 头儿
On it, chief.

24
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,860
难道千斤顶就不会等待上级的命令么
Does Wheeljack not comprehend the chain of command?

25
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,720
我并未许可他在没有掩护的情况下只身冒进
I didn't authorize him to advance without proper cover.

26
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,650
呃…我想老千只是想当着您的面 证明一下他自己 长官
Yeah... I'm sure Jackie's just trying to prove himself now that you and he are serving together again, sir.

27
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,160
依－哈！
Yee-ha!

28
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,160
老千 等一下
Jackie, wait up.

29
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,180
通天晓要我们…
Ultra Magnus wants us...

30
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,840
这个…介个…那个…
Blah, blah, blah.

31
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,860
嘘！嘘！
Shh! Shh!

32
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,140
雷霆救援队的第17条真理：
Wrecker fact number 17:

33
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,160
守卫从不抬头看上面
"Guards never look up."

34
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
糟了
Scrap.

35
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
这就是为什么得有人来掩护
That's why we wait for cover.

36
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,230
唉 真不是时候
Ah, bolts.

37
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,050
嗯…
Uh...

38
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,640
把你给忘了 小鬼
Forgot you were in there, kid.

39
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,570
至少这次没让我待在脚垫儿上
At least I didn't heave on any floormats this time.

40
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,710
你这只悲催的野兽 我是你的指挥官
You miserable beast. I am your commanding officer

41
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,170
我命令你立刻爬回你的窝里去
and I order you to crawl into your kennel, now!

42
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,900
我说了 快去！
I said go, already!

43
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,720
啊！
Ahh!

44
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,740
你到底有什么不可抗拒的理由 非要把这个人类带来？
And what could have possibly compelled you to bring the nativ?

45
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,300
嘿
Yo.

46
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,910
我能一起去吗？
Can I come with?

47
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,180
没问题
Why not?

48
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,510
你是不是头脑短路了 士兵？
Are your circuits impaired, soldier?

49
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,440
擎天柱派你带领雷霆救援队执行这次任务
Prime told you to lead the Wreckers on this one.

50
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
我觉得他是指所有队员
I assumed he meant all of 'em.

51
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,510
你是在跟你的上级开玩笑么？
Are you mocking your commanding officer?

52
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,040
哪敢呢 长官
Wouldn't think of it, sir.

53
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,470
这孩子能耐大着呢 对不对 隔板？
The kid's a full-blown Wrecker. Isn't that right, Bulkhead?

54
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,010
这个嘛…
Well...

55
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,550
听着 或许她个头不大 但她救过我的命
Look. She may be small, but she saved my tailpipe.

56
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,480
她独自干掉了一只机器昆虫
Snuffed an Insecticon all on her own.

57
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,230
毫无疑问 一定又没遵守章程
Outside standard protocol, no doubt.

58
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,270
关键是 我能照顾好自己 长官
The point is, I can handle myself, sir.

59
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,110
神子经历过更严峻的考验
Miko has been through worse

60
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,960
而且我们已经引出了敌人 通道也清理干净了
and we've drawn out the enemy and cleared passage.

61
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,360
好了 现在你给我进去
Okay, now in you go.

62
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,820
来咬我啊 这精锐护甲可不是…
Do your worst. The Apex armor is virtually...

63
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,480
啊！啊！噢！不！啊！放开我！
Ahh! Oh, oh! No! Ahh! Release me!

64
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,680
红蜘蛛 那只野兽在你那里吗？
Starscream, are you with the beast?

65
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,570
是的 主人
Yes, master.

66
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,520
我们正在进行攻击练习呢 他表现良好
We've been reviewing attack maneuvers. He's doing quite well.

67
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,470
一支挖掘小队和我们失去了联系
One of the excavation teams has failed to report in.

68
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,740
我立刻召集我的追踪者大军…
I shall assemble my seeker armada immediately and...

69
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,540
我希望你带领我们失而复得的资产去执行这个任务
I would prefer that you lead our newly-returned asset on this mission

70
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:48,170
这样我们可以看看巨狰狞\N搜寻骸骨的能力是不是和猎杀汽车人一样出色
so that we may see if our Predacon is as adept at fetching bones as it is hunting Autobots.

71
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,980
是它吗？
Is this it?

72
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,340
不 那是块石头
No. That is a rock.

73
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,930
哈 重温旧日时光啊 老千
Heh. Just like old times, huh, Jackie?

74
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,460
以前我选择队友可不需要别人批准
Except back then, I didn't need permission to pick my partners.

75
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,700
行了 我们是一伙的
Come on, we're all on the same team.

76
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,700
嘿 我们都是野兽猎人嘛 对吧？
Hey, Beast Hunters, right?

77
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,710
到达地球之前 当我在宇宙中徘徊时
During all those cycles it took me to travel to Earth

78
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,620
我满脑子想的都是重聚我们失散的战友
all I could think about was getting our band of brothers back together.

79
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,560
不过我可从没把他算上
But this isn't the lineup I had in mind.

80
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,900
你当时离开雷霆救援队 真是明智
You did the smart thin, Bulk, leaving the Wreckers when you did.

81
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,190
那时候我们才算得上真正的利刃 在被某人带成钝刀之前
While we were still bringing our A-game, before the rust set in.

82
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,990
等等 我以为是千斤顶离开了雷霆救援队
Wait, I thought Wheeljack was the one who left the Wreckers.

83
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,310
当通天晓接手雷霆救援队时 老千基本上被遗弃了
Jackie basically deserted once the Wreckers fell under Ultra Magnus' command.

84
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,560
我在那之前就被调到了擎天柱的队伍 参加了雷云关之战
I transferred out before that, to join up with Optimus in the battle of Thunderhead Pass.

85
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,330
有时候我感觉 老千认为我抛弃了他
Sometimes I think Jackie feels like I deserted him.

86
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,940
你不是那种抛弃战友的人 小隔
You don't wanna be the one who breaks up the band, Bulk.

87
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,240
噢！
Oh!

88
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,430
怎么回事？
What was that?

89
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,200
不管那是什么 它的个头可不小
Whatever it is, it's big.

90
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,940
而且速度也不慢
And it's coming fast.

91
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,740
巨狰狞 我们走！
The Predacon. Let's roll.

92
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,700
它回来了？
It's back?

93
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,720
加速！
Accelerate!

94
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,780
那些石头挡不住它多久 必须联系基地以请求支援
That rock won't hold it forever. We need to contact base and request reinforcements.

95
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,090
雷霆救援队从不请求支援
Wreckers don't call for backup.

96
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,390
老千的意思是说 这里距离地表太远 没有通讯信号
What Jackie means is, we can't get a comm-link signal this far underground.

97
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,600
神子 我得把你弄出去 你得从这儿爬上去
Miko, I have to get you out of here. Gonna need you to climb.

98
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,110
没门儿 我要帮忙
No way. I wanna help.

99
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,510
我同意
And you will.

100
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,110
你的任务是：回到我的飞船 然后联系擎天柱
Your mission: Reach my ship so you can contact Optimus Prime.

101
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
遵命 长官！
Yes, sir.

102
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,450
听起来 情况可不太妙
Not sure I like the sound of that.

103
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,830
那么…
So, uh...

104
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,170
我们拼死一搏 就在此时此地！
We make our stand... here and now.

105
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,010
鉴于飞船内空无一人
Given that this ship is currently unoccupied

106
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,130
看来汽车人又在我们的挖掘行动中插了一脚
it would seem the Autobots did stumble upon our little mining operation.

107
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,340
不过别担心
No worries.

108
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,820
“我的”巨狰狞此时一定\N正在把那些碍眼的家伙大卸八块呢
My Predacon is no doubt dismantling the interlopers as we speak.

109
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,210
要驯服那家伙确实不简单 不过这还是难不倒我
It was a challenge, but I managed to tame the savage beast.

110
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,210
现在它已经对我言听计从了
Taught it to heed my every command.

111
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,340
快走开 快走开
Come on, come on.

112
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,370
这么说 你穿这身行头不是怕它咬你？
You're not wearing the armor to protect yourself from it?

113
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
怕我可爱的狞狞？怎么可能呢
From my beloved pet? Of course not.

114
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,700
说实在的 穿这个还真是有点热呢
In fact, it's getting rather warm in here.

115
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,110
哈 清爽透气了
Ah, ventilation.

116
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,120
开火！
Open fire!

117
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,460
哇哦！
Whoa!

118
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
想都别想！
No you don't.

119
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,920
嘿 火焰山！
Hey, hot-head!

120
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
这下惨了
Oh, scrap.

121
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,470
噢 这肯定够他们受的
Ooh, that'll do some damage.

122
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,820
你叫神子 对吧？
Miko, is it?

123
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,070
噢 不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,850
或许你是想用这艘飞船呼叫支援吧？
Were you trying to reach this ship? To call for help, perhaps?

125
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,420
怎么了 小红？欺软怕硬惯了？
What's the matter, 'Screamy? Can't pick on someone your own size?

126
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,940
没想到 它还真找到了
What do you know, it does fetch.

127
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,560
糟了
Scrap.

128
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,820
好吧 剧本没有如期上演
Well, that didn't go exacty as planned.

129
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,600
就连入伍只有一周期的新兵都知道\N不能在一个封闭的空间引爆手雷
That's because any first-cycle Cadet knows better than to detonate a grenade in a confined space.

130
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,300
即使把那只野兽的肚子当成“封闭的空间”也不行么？
Even if I intended the "confined space" to be the belly of the beast?

131
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,680
嗯…长官
Uh, sir...

132
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,850
你的鲁莽行为差一点害死我们所有人
Your actions continue to be just one step removed from getting us all scrapped.

133
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,620
我无意冒犯 长官
With all due respect, sir

134
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,820
但巨狰狞已经逃脱 而神子在外孤身一人
the Predacon's loose and Miko's out there alone.

135
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,990
允许我去提供掩护么 长官？
Permission to provide cover, sir?

136
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,600
继续 撕了她 就像你在下面对雷霆救援队所做的
Go ahead, make a wreck of her, as you no doubt did the Wreckers.

137
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,390
红蜘蛛 报告情况
Starscream, status report.

138
00:17:52,870 --> 00:18:00,420
主人 我们已经取得了骨骸 而巨狰狞此刻正在处理汽车人的人类宠物
Master. We have secured the bone, and our Predacon is dealing with the Autobots' pet human as we speak.

139
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
当然 是在我的指挥下
On my command, of course.

140
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,000
我不会冒险让珍贵的骨骸因你的自大而丢失
I will not risk losing a precious commodity to your arrogance.

141
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,320
我要拆了你！
I'll tear you apart!

142
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,240
立刻让巨狰狞带着我的战利品返回基地！
Have the beast return with my prize, immediately!

143
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,200
你留下解决那些汽车人
You can stay behind and finish the Autobots.

144
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,900
遵命 主人
Yes, master.

145
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,420
不知道能不能让这头愚蠢的野兽…
Assuming I can coerce the brainless brute into...

146
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,100
什么？你怎么从来不听我的命令！
But, you never obey my commands!

147
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,660
你们都听到主人的命令了 我们必须立刻找到那些汽车人
You heard our Master. We must locate the Autobots.

148
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,460
不过我先要拿回属于我的东西
As soon as I retrieve what belongs to me.

149
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,830
啧啧啧 即使最强大的护甲也无法保护最弱小的生物
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk... Even the strongest armor can't protect the weakest of creatures.

150
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,190
它不是保护过你么？
Protected you, didn't it?

151
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,630
现在 看看到底谁拆谁？
Who's wrecking who now?

152
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,640
神子？
Miko?

153
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,410
或许你对这个人类的评价并没有错
Perhaps you weren't wrong about the human after all.

154
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,650
你知道是我干掉了飞过山吧？
You do know that I vanquished Cliffjumper, don't you?

155
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
别显摆了
Big whoop.

156
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,930
我干掉过硬壳！
I snuffed Hardshell.

157
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,640
啊！撤退
Ah! Retreat.

158
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,580
啊！
Aw.

159
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,450
他们把骸骨带走了
They got away with the bone.

160
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,470
嘿 你的表现非常出色 小鬼
Hey, you brought your A-game, kid

161
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,270
无愧于雷霆救援队的称号
like a true Wrecker.

162
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,750
我要记住你们现在的样子
And I wanna remember us just like this...

163
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,720
趁着某人还没把你们变成钝刀
before the rust sets in.

164
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,520
怎么？千斤顶要去哪儿？
What? Where's Wheeljack going?

165
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,830
单飞
Solo.

166
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,150
又一次？
Again?

167
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,830
老千把我们的乐队解散了
Jackie just broke up the band.
