1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,750
擎天柱 这是实验型全地形突击战车
Prime, what we have here is an experimental all-terrain expeditionary fighting vehicle

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,850
由我们掩护部门最好的工程师们研制而成
designed by the finest engineers in our M.A.S.K. division.

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,710
谢谢你 福勒探员
Thank you, Agent Fowler.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,510
完全是为我量身定做的
This will most certainly do.

5
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,500
返回路径的波动已稳定
Return trajectory fluctuations have been stabilized.

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,500
通天晓 我们已准备好接你回来
Ultra Magnus, we are ready to receive you.

7
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,290
我们对旧基地残骸的搜索没什么重大收获
We didn't find much else in the rubble of the former base.

8
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,390
这个难道不算是“重大收获”？
You call this... "not much else?"

9
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,470
嘿！
Huh!

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:03,790
呃?
Eh?

11
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,110
千斤顶！
Wheeljack!

12
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,230
你这样可能会对他人造成严重伤害！
You could've caused serious damage.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,070
对我！
To me!

14
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,620
搞什么飞机呢？
What in the Sam hill?

15
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,060
帮把手行吗？
A little help here?

16
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,260
你头脑短路了么 士兵？
What were you thinking, soldier?

17
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,540
我以为小隔能接住我那一球
I was thinking Bulk would catch that lob.

18
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,880
我跟你把话说清楚！
Allow me to make myself clear.

19
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,040
作为擎天柱的首席副官
As Optimus Prime's second-in-command

20
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,940
我绝不会纵容任何雷霆救援队式的作风
I have no intention of tolerating Wrecker behavior.

21
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,450
有些人就是死心眼儿啊
Some things never change.

22
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,790
老千…
Jackie...

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,310
我提醒你 在塞博特恩 是擎天柱亲自任命我指挥你们雷霆救援队的
Need I remind you that it was Optimus Prime himself who assigned me to command your Wreckers back on Cybertron

24
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,780
他让我来拴住你们这些脱缰野马！
and get you loose cannons under control?

25
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,530
作为一名合格的战士 纪律永远是第一位的
An effective combat unit begins with discipline.

26
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,730
如果你无法做到这点 那么你大可以选择一条轻松的路
If you won't accept that, feel free to choose the path of least resistance...

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
就如同你从前那样
As you did before.

28
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,730
要是我的飞船现在没变成一堆废铁
If my ship weren't a twisted wreck at present

29
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,800
我早就拔腿走人了 长官…
I'd do that... sir.

30
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,700
唉
Huh...

31
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,570
言归正传 有擎天柱的消息吗？
So, any word from Optimus?

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,650
他正在调查霸天虎的近期活动
He's investigating recent Decepticon activity

33
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,940
大有希望找到一个能量矿
hopefully an Energon mine.

34
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,050
嗯…
Hmm...

35
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,570
要是你们都有擎天柱的飞行背包 那该有多酷啊
How rad would it be if you all had jetpacks like Optimus?

36
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,510
会很酷的 神子
Quite rad, Miko.

37
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,400
但修复擎天柱已经耗尽了卓天越之锤的能量
But the Forge has been depleted of its power to do that.

38
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,230
现在只能用它来敲东西了
Now it's only good for pounding out dings.

39
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,260
烟幕?
Smokescreen?

40
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,630
哇 你是怎么认出我的？
Aw, what gave me away?

41
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,960
给点支持嘛 伪装自己 不是吗？
Come on, "robots in disguise," right?

42
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,640
你去哪儿了 士兵？
Where have you been, soldier?

43
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,560
去扫描新的战斗涂装
Scanning new war paint.

44
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,330
我觉得自己该主动向擎天柱学习…
Thought it'd be proactive to follow Optimus' lead...

45
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,680
还有大黄蜂
and Bumblebee's.

46
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,940
现在你可以衣着光鲜地去堆那些空箱子了
Now you can look your best while stacking those empty cubes.

47
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,570
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,070
我差点都当领袖了 却还把我当成菜鸟
I was nearly a Prime, but somehow I'm still a rookie.

49
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,450
你说什么“领袖”？
What was that about a "Prime?"

50
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,090
呃…不 是“领悟”
Uh... no, time.

51
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,900
我该领悟到 自己不能再当菜鸟了
Time to stop acting like a rookie.

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,700
烟幕是唯一一个回去救擎天柱的人
Smokescreen was the only one who went back.

53
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,960
如果没有他
If it weren't for him

54
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,870
擎天柱可能已经离开我们了
Optimus might not be with us today.

55
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,410
阿尔茜 我们当时接到了死命令
Arcee, we were under the strictest of orders.

56
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,300
你们三个必须保护你们的人类伙伴
The three of you had your human partners to protect.

57
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,300
但幸运的是 烟幕严重缺乏实战经验 没有服从命令
But we are fortunate that Smokescreen is inexperienced enough not to have followed protocol.

58
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,800
在那里 我看到了
There. I can see it.

59
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,790
停止挖掘！
Abandon the excavation.

60
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,940
立刻！
Now.

61
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,800
给我打！
Attack!

62
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,880
擎天柱 你找到能量了？
Optimus, did you find Energon?

63
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,950
没有 但是我发现了这个
No. But I did uncover this.

64
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,780
这不可能是…
It cannot be.

65
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,730
是什么？
Be what?

66
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,880
一块儿古老的…
The ancient remains...

67
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,450
…巨狰狞遗骸
of a Predacon.

68
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,250
就算这块头骨出现在你们星球的原因尚不明朗
Though it remains unclear why such a skull would be found on your planet

69
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,820
但它的出现一定和威震天\N最近派出追击我们的巨狰狞紧密相关
its presence reveals all too much about the Predacon which Megatron recently sent in pursuit of us.

70
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,320
你是说那只被我们冻住的机器龙？
You mean that dragon bot we put on ice?

71
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,990
但巨狰狞早已灭绝了 早在…早在…
Except that Predacons have been extinct since, well...

72
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,940
早在大多数生命出现在塞博特恩之前
Since before most life began on Cybertron.

73
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,470
他们就像是地球上的恐龙
They're like Earth's dinosaurs.

74
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,920
就是说 你们见到巨狰狞就好比我们碰到霸王龙一样
Which means, for you guys, running into one would be like us meeting a T-Rex.

75
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,710
那机器恐龙呢？
So then what were dinobots?

76
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,060
完全不是一码事
Totally different.

77
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,220
看来挖掘远古遗骸已成了威震天的新兴趣
With Megatron's seeming new interest in the excavation of prehistoric skeletons

78
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,810
再加上霸天虎队伍里的那个科学家…
and a certain scientist back among the Decepticon ranks...

79
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,750
由此推断
It would stand to reason

80
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,350
震荡波根据这种遗骸克隆出了那只野兽
that Shockwave cloned the beast from one such find.

81
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,430
而现在威震天想再克隆一只
And now Megatron's looking to clone another.

82
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,700
你觉得铁桶头会仅仅满足于一只么？
What makes you think buckethead would stop at just one?

83
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,230
我们将会面临一场野兽之战
We could have beast wars on our hands.

84
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,410
而且 如果震荡波仅凭一小股C.N.A.
And if Shockwave only requires a single strand of CNA

85
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,430
就可以克隆出一只野兽的话…
from which to clone a beast...

86
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,240
那么他已经得到克隆它所需的一切了
He already possesses what he needs to engender this one.

87
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,710
汽车人们 我们必须得化身为野兽猎人了
Autobots, we must become Beast Hunters.

88
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,930
还有一件事仍然说不通
One thing still doesn't follow.

89
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,670
既然巨狰狞在塞博特恩就已经灭绝了
Predacons went extinct on Cybertron.

90
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,970
他们的骸骨怎么会出现在这里？
So what would their bones be doing here?

91
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,540
在地球上？
On Earth?

92
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,020
你们不觉得这有点荒谬吗？
I mean, isn't it just a little preposterous?

93
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,130
这些骸骨并非属于巨狰狞 红蜘蛛
They are not the remains of Predacons, Starscream.

94
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,660
它们来自于巨狰狞的克隆体
But, rather, the remains of Predacon clones.

95
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,840
你还不知道 我们最近释放的这只汽车人猎手
For you see... Our recent Autobot hunter wasn't the first bestial super-soldier

96
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,460
并不是震荡波从史前遗骸中\N培育出的第一个超级野兽战士
Shockwave ever attempted to breed from prehistoric matter.

97
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,560
早在塞博特恩战争时期
During the war for Cybertron

98
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,750
我就授权将一小支巨狰狞克隆体部队派到了地球
I sanctioned the dispatch of a small army of these preda-clones to Earth

99
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,250
用以消灭毫无防备的汽车人地球驻守部队
to unleash the beasts on unwitting Autobot forces stationed here.

100
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,730
当它们完成了任务
Once they accomplished their mission

101
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,690
幸存的巨狰狞克隆体留在了这个世界
the surviving Predacons held sentinel on this very world

102
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,630
在未来的岁月里作为我忠诚的哨兵
for ages to come

103
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,440
看守着它们夺取的能量储备
guarding the Energon reserves they had managed to secure

104
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,790
并等待着我的到来
while awaiting my arrival.

105
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,390
当然 我们的重聚被延误了很久
Of course, our reunion here was much delayed

106
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,730
而且 看起来我们的野兽没有经受住时间的考验
and it would seem we lost the beasts to the ravages of time.

107
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
但其内部物质却得以幸存
But not their endo-matter

108
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,800
逻辑上我可以由此提取出他们的C.N.A.
from which I am logically able to extract their very CNA.

109
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,230
切…又要我们去捡破烂？
Pff. Another scavenger hunt?

110
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,930
逻辑上 我们要在如此广大的世界里\N寻找你旧宠物那些老得掉渣的…残骸
How logical would it really be to locate all the dusty remains of your former pets?

111
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,880
你觉得我将自己的创造物 派往一个遥远的星球之前
You are not suggesting that I would send my creations to a distant planet

112
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,380
不会先给他们装上定位芯片吗？
without first having them... micro-chipped?

113
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,350
呃…我本来是这么觉得的
Eh... Well... well, I was.

114
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,180
不过 说真的 你真装上了？
But, seriously, you did?

115
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,270
这是我们历史文献中的资料
From our historical texts.

116
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,690
但这些几乎都是我们的神话和中世纪文学中\N所描述的生物 只不过换成了金属版本
But those are metal versions of creatures from our Greek mythology and medieval literature.

117
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,300
根本不是恐龙
Not dinosaurs.

118
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:53,080
巨狰狞在古代曾经出没于地球 应该是一个合理的推断
It would stand to reason that Predacons did indeed walk upon this Earth in ancient times

119
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,190
因为它们似乎已成为众多人类民间传说的重要组成部分
as they seem to have been the basis for much of humankind's folklore.

120
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:05,010
这再次证明了地球与塞博特恩的过去是紧密相连的
Illustrating once again that the pasts of Earth and Cybertron are inextricably linked.

121
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,540
人工合成能量？
Synthetic Energon?

122
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,700
没错
Indeed.

123
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,270
鉴于我们的基地被毁 我们失去了所有的能量储备
I am concerned that without access to any Energon reserves since our base was destroyed

124
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,410
我担心我们应对危机的能力会被严重削弱
our ability to deal with impending crises will be severely hampered.

125
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,290
一个明智的决定 老朋友
A wise decision, old friend.

126
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,130
但是 请你…
Just, please...

127
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,600
别抱太高期望
manage your expectations.

128
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,410
毕竟我的工作环境比从前还要简陋
I am working with even more rudimentary hardware than before.

129
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,210
擎天柱 卫星监控侦测到了两处霸天虎的活动迹象
Prime! Satellite surveillance has picked up two signs of Decepticon activity:

130
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,710
一处靠近埃尔帕索油田
one near an oil field outside of El Paso

131
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,070
另一处在苏格兰赫布里底群岛峭壁附近
the other near the Hebrides bluffs in Scotland.

132
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,920
所以别忘了带上苏格兰短裙
So don't Forget to pack your kilts.

133
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,930
我们必须兵分两路
We must divide our resources.

134
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,570
通天晓 你带领雷霆救援队员前往峭壁
Ultra Magnus, lead the Wreckers to the bluffs.

135
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
遵命 擎天柱
Yes, Optimus.

136
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,970
呃…苏格兰短裙是什么?
Uh... What's a kilt?

137
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,360
福勒探员有时候说话不太着调
Agent Fowler can, at times, be oblique.

138
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,950
我觉得这种时候我们最好无视他 然后尽快离开
I find it best to simply nod and mobilize.

139
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,910
隔板 千斤顶 跟我出发！
Bulkhead, Wheeljack, let's roll.

140
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,020
唉…
Uh...

141
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,450
擎天柱 我知道这把铸锤身上寄托了很多的情感
Optimus, I know there are many emotions tied to the Forge.

142
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,240
现在没有时间来缅怀这些了
This is no time to stand on ceremony.

143
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,220
我很荣幸能去发挥它的实战价值
I would be honored to put this to some practical use.

144
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,660
我去搜索这个区域
I will search this quadrant.

145
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,530
嘿 小蜂
Hey 'Bee

146
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,700
你想没想过你或许会成为一名领袖？
have you ever thought you might wanna be a Prime?

147
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,680
当然不是现在 在将来的某天
Not now. Someday.

148
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,040
你是战士 没错 这点咱俩一样
"Warrior." Yeah, you and me both.

149
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,290
但我见过你的能耐
But I've seen you in action

150
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,650
擎天柱知道你是打虎能手
Optimus knows you can scrap with the best of 'em.

151
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,260
为什么他还要你当侦察兵 而不晋升你？
Why won't he just promote you from scout already?

152
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,980
你自愿的？好吧
Your choice? Hmm.

153
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,000
为什么甘于做个小兵
So, why wait?

154
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,620
我猜将晋升的那一刻 留给回到塞博特恩确实更有意义
Guess it would be more meaningful to graduate back home on Cybertron.

155
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,740
你是个耐得住性子的人
You're one patient guy.

156
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,920
我该向你学学
I should take a cue.

157
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,580
我就说吧 你作为一个侦察兵真是屈才了
Like I said, you got nice chops for a scout.

158
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,680
这一幕够经典！
How epic was that?

159
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,150
哇哦…这就是为什么他才是领袖！
Whoo! And that's why he's a Prime!

160
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,540
声波
Soundwave.

161
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
够了！
Enough.

162
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,490
不！
No!

163
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,620
我们已经拿到所需要的全部了！
We have all that we need.

164
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,060
一小股C.N.A.
"A single strand of CNA..."

165
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,530
震荡波
Shockwave.

166
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,030
我了解到你在战场上与擎天柱正面交锋了
I understand that you engaged Optimus Prime in the field.

167
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,700
仅仅是为了保全这个样本 威震天陛下
Only in order to secure the specimen, lord Megatron.

168
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,090
我最欣赏的工程师啊
I believed that you had perished once

169
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,330
我已经失去过你一次了
my most prized engineer

170
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,640
而且我极度怀疑 如果没有你 巨狰狞计划还能否完成
and I highly doubt that project Predacon can be completed without you.

171
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,720
我会将取回遗骸的任务转交给红蜘蛛
I shall leave the fetching of bones to Starscream

172
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,470
而我本人则会留在实验室里 以加快计划的完成速度
and confine myself to my laboratory in order to accelerate results.

173
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,370
非常好！
Excellent...

174
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,890
因为我已经迫不及待
For I am rather impatient

175
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,650
想要欣赏我的野兽大军将人类踏在脚下的美景了
to witness my army of beasts trample humankind underfoot.
