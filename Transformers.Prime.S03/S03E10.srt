1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,260
简单的说 这种化合物可以让我们数字化整个世界
Simply put, this combination of elements could allow us to cyberform entire worlds.

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,760
哎…貌似震荡波又在琢磨什么蹩脚的计划了
Eh... why do I feel a Shockwave plan coming on?

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,930
啊…噢
Kah... oh

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,010
红蜘蛛 别以为你险些让我\N落入汽车人手中的事就这么完了
Do not think for a moment, Starscream.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,830
红蜘蛛 别以为你险些让我\N落入汽车人手中的事就这么完了
That it has gone Unnoticed that you left me at the mercy of the Autobots.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,630
啊 主人？难道您就任由您的一个副官去伤害另一个？
Aah. Master? Are you going to allow one lieutenant to harm another?

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,430
主人？！
Master?

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,740
我在考虑呢…
I'm thinking.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,160
我准备让你也体验一下独眼的感觉
I am tempted to force you to share my perception of things.

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,170
不！我那么做完全是为了任务着想
No! I only did what I thought was best for the mission.

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,910
但我必须补充一下 发生这个小意外
But I do feel compelled to add that it was my very error

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,990
确实是因为我的重大失误！
in judgment that made this happy accident possible!

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,630
我当时并不知道你想在汽车人\N到达之前销毁实验室的敏感数据
If I recollect, you were seeking to purge your laboratory of sensitive materials before the Autobots arrived.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,870
你怎么看？
Were you not?

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,370
你的解释…符合逻辑
Your argument... is logical.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,170
多么融洽的团队精神 告诉我 震荡波
Exemplary teamwork. Now tell me, Shockwave.

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,770
为何这种物质生长得如此混乱？
Why does this cyber-matter resemble chaos?

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,120
很明显 其基础元素仍不稳定
The basic elements are apparently unstable

19
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,830
我会集中精力解决这个问题
I will turn my attention to correcting that.

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,930
嗯 但是 无论是用这种物质恢复塞博特恩
Ah... nevertheless, should we use this cyber-matter to restore Cybertron

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,990
或是数字化地球 都需要某种启动装置 是吧？
or cyberform earth, we would require a launch mechanism, would we not?

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,150
那我们就先集中手头的所有资源
Then we will focus all our remaining resources

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,890
全力修复终极之锁吧
upon the successful reconstruction of the Omega Lock.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,620
我已经尽我所能了
I've done everything I can.

25
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,390
鉴于我缺乏趁手的设备
Considering the limitations of my equipment

26
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,520
以及合适的配件
and less than ideal spare parts.

27
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,250
目前我们仍无法确定 通天晓的假肢是否适合战斗…
It remains uncertain if Ultra Magnus's new appendage will be fit for battle...

28
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,820
不过经过足够的物理治疗
though it should prove functional

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,310
它应该能发挥一定的作用
after the requisite amount of therapy.

30
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,250
也只能希望如此了 老朋友
That is all we can hope for, old friend.

31
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,970
你没事吧？
You doing okay?

32
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,980
至少两只手都还在
I'm still two-fisted.

33
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,740
通天晓也是
So's Magnus.

34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,500
等着瞧吧 这爪子将会成为他的标志性象征
Wait and see, the claw's gonna become his signature...

35
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,960
你明白的 就像救护车塞到你喉咙里的那个发声器！
You know, like the way you own that voice box Ratchet slapped in your throat!

36
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,830
嗯…我是说 大家完全能听懂你说的话！
I mean, you know, everyone understands you fine!

37
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,480
何必还总想着去修复它呢 对吧？
Why would you even consider getting it fixed now, am I right?

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,870
哇噢 他说什么？
Whoa, what'd he say?

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,170
小蜂还是很想找回自己的声音
Bee's kind of still attached to the sound of his own voice...

40
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,630
他原本的声音
His original one.

41
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,230
嘿 看看好的一面
Hey, look at the bright, shiny side

42
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,570
通天晓指挥官和老千稍一出手\N就让巨狰狞计划变成一纸空谈了
Commander Magnus and Jackie single-handedly put the kibosh on project Predacon.

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,340
但就我们所知 至少还有一只野兽仍存活于世
Though at least one beast that we know of remains...

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,000
并且具有变形能力
The one who has demonstrated the ability to transform.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,500
冲云霄 我们很快就会策划对汽车人的进攻
Predaking, we will soon plot our strike against the Autobots

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,720
要让他们为对你族群的恶行付出代价
to punish them for the massacre of your kind.

47
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,260
我非常期待能手刃仇家
While I fully intend to exact my revenge

48
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,330
但巨狰狞计划只不过试图打造一支小队
Project Predacon was merely a squadron

49
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,330
而非一支大军
not an army.

50
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,610
我明白…
I see...

51
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,970
我的君王 如果您真的渴望恢复我们的家园
My liege, if you truly aspire to restore our home world

52
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,490
那么 我有充足的信心 您将通过残留于塞博特恩的骸骨
Then I have every faith that you will resurrect the entirety of the Predacon race

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,340
复活整个巨狰狞种族
from the remains which lie there

54
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,620
这样我就可以带领他们 抗击我们共同的任何敌人
So that I may lead them against any and all of our shared enemies.

55
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,890
我们已搜集到终极之锁的大部分残骸
We salvaged much of the wreckage of the Omega Lock.

56
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,900
但它们都已严重受损
But the damage was quite severe.

57
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,750
我恳请选择性地使用地球技术
I would urge the selective use of earth technology

58
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,090
改造其操作系统 这样比重新建造要更有效率
Retro-fitting its operating systems will be more efficient than rebuilding from scratch.

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,760
那么也要让红蜘蛛物尽其用
Then do provide Starscream with your wish list.

60
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,860
由于震荡波将投身于稳定塞博特恩网状物的研究之中
Since Shockwave must turn his attention to the stabilization of our Cyber-matter

61
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,410
你就去负责搜集工作吧
you will be in charge of acquisitions.

62
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,070
擎天柱！我们又有麻烦了
Prime! We have trouble brewing.

63
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,660
虎子们昨天深夜袭击了洛斯阿拉莫斯核电站
The Cons staged a smash-and-grab at the Los Alamos nuclear plant late last night

64
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,490
并抢走了二十吨反应堆控制棒
and made off with 20 tons of control rods.

65
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,930
霸天虎们到底想要建造什么？
What are the Decepticons looking to build?

66
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,230
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

67
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,130
我已确认 由击倒提供的\N合成能量就是导致不稳定的根源
I have determined that the synthetic energon formula provided by Knockout is the source of the instability.

68
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,290
原因是其配方还不完整
Simply because it is incomplete.

69
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,660
那么 尽快将其补充完整
Then make haste and complete it.

70
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,450
因为我们不只需要足够的网状物来重建一颗星球
We will not only require enough Cyber-matter to rebuild one planet

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
还需要用其改造另一颗
But to remake a second.

72
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,310
主人 恕我冒昧
Master, excuse my impudence.

73
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,660
但统治两个世界是否符合逻辑？
But what is the logic behind ruling two worlds?

74
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,340
我过了很久才意识到
It has taken me quite some time to fully comprehend

75
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,070
地球与塞博特恩一直是紧密相连的
that Earth and Cybertron have always been linked, two halves of one whole

76
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,510
它们是一个整体的两个部分\N正如原始天尊与宇宙大帝
Primus and Unicron.

77
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,690
所以 只得到其中之一
And that, to rule only one

78
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,190
无异于同时失去了两个
Would be to never truly rule either.

79
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,770
擎天柱！
Prime!

80
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,070
虎子又露头了 而且被我们抓了个正着
It's Cons again In progress this time.

81
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,150
坐标已收到 福勒探员
Coordinates received, Agent Fowler.

82
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,650
出发！
Let's roll!

83
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,070
慢着 慢着！
Yip-yip!

84
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:43,190
我还要继续检测你的手部灵敏度\N才能决定你是否适合执行任务
Your ability to roll remains predicated upon further exploration of your manual dexterity.

85
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,370
在医疗事项上 恐怕救护车比我更有发言权
I'm afraid that Ratchet's authority supersedes my own in medical matters.

86
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,680
唉…我明白
Eh... understood.

87
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,430
哇噢!
Wow!

88
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,540
救护车 打开环陆桥
Ratchet, reopen the groundbridge.

89
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,420
但要保证人类在安全距离以外
But ensure that the humans are kept at a safe distance

90
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,060
因为我们要带回一个霸天虎俘虏
For we will be returning with a Decepticon prisoner.

91
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,810
得益于我们的先见之明 基地已被护盾笼罩了
Because we had the foresight to shield our new base

92
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,070
我们的俘虏无法给霸天虎战舰发送坐标
our captive will be unable to transmit his coordinates to the decepticon warship.

93
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,880
反过来说 战舰也无法锁定他的位置
Nor will they, in turn, be able to pinpoint his location.

94
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,450
看来我们有足够的时间 让闷骚先生吐露心声了
Guess we have all the time in the world to make Mr. Personality tell us everything he knows.

95
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,190
虎子的监控主管一定知道不少内幕吧？
The Con's veillance chief must know a lot, right?

96
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,710
但声波不会说话…
But Soundwave doesn't speak...

97
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,100
是吧？
Does he?

98
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,280
我都不确定他是不是有脸
I'm not sure he even has a face.

99
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,510
鉴于激光鸟无法定位声波的位置
With Laserbeak unable to triangulate Soundwave's current location

100
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,020
您就不担心我们这位同僚会把什么都招了？
Are you not concerned about what our comrade might spill?

101
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,520
有一点 我可以确认
Of one thing, I'm certain.

102
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,030
声波很清楚何时该开口
Soundwave knows when to impart information

103
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,650
何时该闭嘴
And when to withhold it.

104
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,760
威震天为何要窃取人类科技？
Why is Megatron stealing human technology?

105
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,630
他究竟打算建造什么？
What is he attempting to build?

106
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,450
威…威…威震天为何要窃取人类科…科…科技？
Wwwhy is MMegatron stealing human ttechnology?

107
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,550
他…他…他到底打算建造什…什…么？
Wwwhat is he attempting tto build?

108
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,490
哇哦 混音版擎天柱啊！
Wow, Optimus Prime: the remix!

109
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,960
小子很狂啊？让我把他的笑脸变成哭脸！
Oh, yeah? Why don't I wipe that smile right off his face.

110
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,360
声波 我们对你已经很客气了
Soundwave, we have treated you fairly.

111
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,220
为了这颗星球的居民着想
For the sake of the natives of this planet

112
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,650
告诉我们威震天究竟要建造什么？
tell us what Megatron is attempting to build

113
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,790
不然我们就必须采用一些非常规的审讯手段了
Before we are forced to rely upon less civil methods of interrogation.

114
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,820
别浪费时间了！
Scrap this!

115
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,760
声波从里到外都不是一个正常的塞博特恩人
Soundwave is no ordinary Cybertronian, inside or out

116
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,050
所以我强烈建议把他开膛破肚
So I would strongly suggest opening him up

117
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,920
先仔细研究一下他硬盘上的数据
so we can have a first-hand look at the information recorded on his drives.

118
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,870
啊哦
Ah-oh.

119
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,470
行了 他在下载数据
All right, he's downloading data.

120
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,740
不 声波在删除数据
No. Soundwave is erasing data.

121
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,410
声波优越 汽车人低劣\N（86大电影台词）
Soundwave superior. Autobots inferior.

122
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,630
他是不是…？
Is he...?

123
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,860
他的主要功能仍在运作
His vital signs remain functional.

124
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,950
似乎只是切断了所有的通讯功能
It seems he has simply severed all communications

125
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,850
通过破坏自己的硬盘
by crashing his own drives.

126
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,610
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

127
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,800
我已经找到了这个世界上唯一一个
I have located the one item upon this world which possesses

128
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,970
具有足够的原始能量来驱动重铸的终极之锁的物体
enough raw tonnage to power the reconstructed Omega Lock.

129
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,150
一台粒子同步对撞机
A Particle Collider's Synchrotron.

130
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,780
非常好 震荡波
Excellent, Shockwave.

131
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,490
但是 完善合成能量配方的难度\N远在我的预期之上
However, the successful completion of the synthetic energon formula

132
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,490
但是 完善合成能量配方的难度\N远在我的预期之上
is proving to be far more difficult than anticipated.

133
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,470
击倒从汽车人的医生那里获取了这个未完成配方
Knockout first procured this unfinished shamble from the Autobot medic

134
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,690
不是么？
did he not?

135
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,550
我也是这么理解的
That is my understanding.

136
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,160
那么最快的解决办法 就是将那名医生弄到手
Then the most efficient means to an end

137
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,790
那么最快的解决办法 就是将那名医生弄到手
may very well be to recruit that medic.

138
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,960
试图绑架一个几乎寸步不离基地的汽车人…
Attempting to abduct the one Autobot who rarely leaves their base...

139
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,080
而且也不知道他们基地的位置
a base we have yet to locate.

140
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,930
…这可有点不好办啊
May prove to be a challenge.

141
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,590
你忘了 我们的人现在正在汽车人的基地里
You forget that we currently have an agent within the Autobot base.

142
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,030
激光鸟可以重新与声波建立连接
Laserbeak could reconnect with Soundwave

143
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,920
并将指令上传给他
And upload his directive to him.

144
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,240
但这仍需要找到他们的基地
Which would still require knowing the location of their base.

145
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,500
我猜声波的监控记录可不只包括那些孩子
It is my understanding that Soundwave kept surveillance records of more than just the human children.

146
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,040
擎天柱！最近这些虎子的\N抢劫案让布莱斯将军把我盯得很紧
Prime! These recent Con heists have general bryce breathing down my neck.

147
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,580
我今天还得回炉去被烤个外焦里嫩
So I gotta get back to the barbecue today for another grilling.

148
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,830
明白 福勒探员
Understood, Agent Fowler.

149
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,530
请放心 一旦我们的俘虏清醒过来
And rest assured, should our prisoner return online

150
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,910
我们会立即继续对他进行审讯
We will resume our interrogation.

151
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,760
听起来不错
Sounds like a plan.

152
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,920
我会尽快赶回基地
I'll get back to base as soon as possible.

153
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,900
您召见我 威震天陛下
You summoned me, Lord Megatron.

154
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,880
我需要你做一件事
I require your services

155
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,460
我们已预料到汽车人\N会对我们的下一次行动进行干预
since we anticipate an Autobot presence at our next event.

156
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,390
我非常期待能再次面对擎天柱
I welcome any opportunity to face the Prime again

157
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,970
来一场战士间的对决
warrior to warrior.

158
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,110
你对自己的进化沾沾自喜
You pride yourself on your evolution

159
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,110
但见识却毫无长进！
Yet you have learned nothing!

160
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,330
我可能已经失去了我的监控主管
I may have lost my surveillance chief today.

161
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,830
汽车人已经壮大了自己的队伍 而我们却日渐萎靡
The Autobots have expanded their forces, while ours continue to dwindle.

162
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,380
那么我会以双倍的努力投入战斗
Then I shall simply battle twice as fiercely.

163
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,690
还得像个野兽一样！
As a beast!

164
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,890
我正在赶回基地
I'm on my way to the base

165
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,330
但我收到了一个消息
but I just got word.

166
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,740
虎子们袭击了位于南极的索拉力粒子对撞机工程
The Cons busted into the Solaris Particle Collider Project at the south pole.

167
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,740
（Solaris 索拉力为音译 意思是太阳系）
The Cons busted into the Solaris Particle Collider Project at the south pole.

168
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,770
汽车人
Autobots.

169
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,370
（Solaris 索拉力为音译 意思是太阳系）
Wha--? Yip-yip--

170
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,370
啥？慢着 慢着…
Wha--? Yip-yip--

171
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,920
大夫 指挥官已经准备好了
Doc, the Commander's ready.

172
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,600
唉 好吧 好吧
Oh... Fine, fine...

173
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,040
隔板 烟幕
Bulkhead, Smokescreen

174
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,010
和救护车一起留在这里 看守犯人
remain here with Ratchet to guard our prisoner.

175
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,490
其他人 变形出发！
Every one else, transform and roll out!

176
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,650
能不能找块布把他遮起来？
Can't we throw a tarp over him?

177
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,190
他让我直起鸡皮疙瘩
He's creeping me out.

178
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,390
没错 无论你从哪个方向看
Yeah. It's like he's watching

179
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,810
他都好像在盯着你
no matter where you go.

180
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,160
你们俩能不能别再纠结声波的眼睛问题
Would both of you stop focusing on what Soundwave can or cannot see

181
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,660
帮我想想他到底隐瞒了什么？
and help me figure out what he did not tell?

182
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,460
比如威震天为何对一台能量\N大到能制造出黑洞的机器感兴趣？
Like why Megatron would be interested in something believed to generate enough power

183
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,720
比如威震天为何对一台能量\N大到能制造出黑洞的机器感兴趣？
to create a Black Hole.

184
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,790
黑洞吗？
Black holes?

185
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,830
那可能是威震天想吞噬整个宇宙
So Megatron's looking to swallow up the known universe.

186
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,430
以及宇宙里的一切
And everything in it.

187
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,540
不对 不对！
No, no.

188
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,100
他仅仅是想借助这种可以吞噬宇宙的力量
He would merely want to harness the power of something capable of swallowing worlds.

189
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,490
用来…创造某物
In order to... create one.

190
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,130
哦 天啊…
Oh my...

191
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,790
擎天柱 我知道现在时机不妥\N但这条信息可能有助于你的任务
Optimus, I know this hardly seems the time... but it may aid you in your task.

192
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,830
说吧
Go ahead.

193
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,190
我相信威震天试图重铸终极之锁
I believe that Megatron may be attempting to rebuild the Omega Lock.

194
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,070
我们是不是任由他这么做？
Do we let him?

195
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,570
不 你我都心知肚明
No. For you know as well as I...

196
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,370
威震天会使用终极之锁同时数字化塞博特恩和地球
that Megatron will use a reconstructed lock to Cyberform both Cybertron and Earth.

197
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,860
我们不能容忍这种暴行
And that is one abuse of power that we cannot allow.

198
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,250
唉 明白了
Awh... understood.

199
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,910
快闪开!
Down!

200
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,280
一定不能让霸天虎得逞！
The Decepticons must not be allowed to secure their target.

201
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,240
我来对付这只巨狰狞
I will engage the Predacon.

202
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,500
你们都听到领袖的命令了 继续前进！
You heard your leader. Forge ahead.

203
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,840
呀!
Yaah!

204
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,270
哇！
Wha!

205
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,350
啊！
Aah!

206
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,040
呃！
Yaah!

207
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,330
喔啊！
Woah!

208
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,260
他们知道我们会来！
Somebody knew we were coming!

209
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,360
还用说?
You think?

210
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,220
救护车 即使不用卓天越之锤或者终极之锁
Ratchet, it may not be with the forge or the Omega Lock

211
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,720
我们也一定会找到办法来修复家园的
but we're gonna find a way to get our planet repaired.

212
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,510
噢 不！
Oh, no!

213
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,290
啊！
Ah!

214
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,300
嗯？！
Heh!?

215
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,800
呀…啊
Yah... Dah...!

216
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,650
呃…
Eh...

217
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,600
呀！
Yaah!

218
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,410
呃！呃…哦！
Eh... eh... oh...

219
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,020
啊！
Aah!

220
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,830
啊！
Ah!

221
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,250
噢…
Oh...
