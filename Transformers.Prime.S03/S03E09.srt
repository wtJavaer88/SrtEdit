1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,710
啊！又一个废弃的矿井？！
Ah!? Another abandoned mine?!

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,360
随我来 红蜘蛛
Come, Starscream.

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,620
我的君王 谁能预料到我那超级战士实验会遭遇…
My liege, who could have foreseen that my alternative super-soldier experiment would encounter...

4
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,780
技术性难题呢？
The technical difficulties?

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,950
赔上了全部昆虫大军和我们半数以上的部队吗？！
Resulting in the loss of the insecticon hive and over half our remaining troops!

6
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,500
请原谅我 主人！小人一片忠心 苍天可见！
Forgive me, Master! My intentions were true!

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,510
求求您！小的再次给您磕头了！
Please! Please reconsider my termination!

8
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,770
哦 原来这是震荡波的秘密实验室啊
Oh, Shockwave's offsite laboratory.

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,590
地方不错嘛
Most impressive.

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,550
巨狰狞的克隆进展已经接近尾声
The Predacon clones have almost fully evolved

11
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,500
预计将在三个太阳周期内完成战备
and will be combat-ready within three solar cycles.

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,830
干得好！震荡波
Well done! Shockwave.

13
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,220
击倒！我在等你
Knockout! I'm waiting.

14
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,470
马上就到 威震天陛下
On my way. Lord Megatron!

15
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,360
合成能量…士兵们将会把剩下的库存送过来
Synthetic Energon... troops will be delivering my remaining supply to you.

16
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,860
等威震天陛下的巨狰狞大军部署准备完毕\N我会来评估其价值的
I will determine its value after Lord Megatron's Predacon army is ready for deployment.

17
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,270
没规矩的畜生！你竟敢未经许可随处乱逛？
Unruly beast! You dare to roam freely without permission?

18
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,670
啊！呃！
Aaah! Eh!

19
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,340
啊！！！
Aaaah!!!

20
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,870
什么？！
What!?

21
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,390
再碰我一次！我就把那棍子插进你的火种里
Strike me again! And I will bury that rod in your spark.

22
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,990
我…我没想到野兽居然也能变形
I... I did not realize that the beast was capable of transformation.

23
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,970
我也很意外呢！
Nor did I!

24
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,820
我不是野兽！
I am no beast!

25
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,930
啊！
Aah!

26
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,940
变形能力是塞博特恩人的基本生理功能
The ability to transform is a fundamental part of Cybertronian biology.

27
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,970
但我们手中缺乏依据 去证明巨狰狞种群已进化至那个阶段
We simply posses no evidence that the Predacon species ever reached that evolutionary stage

28
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,890
鉴于他们在大灾变中已经灭绝
since they became extinct in the great cataclysm.

29
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,140
现在我们知道了…啊…
And now we know... Ah...

30
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,340
如此说来…传言是真的
So... the rumors are true.

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,630
我也不再孤单了
I would no longer be alone.

32
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,560
原来你一直有所隐瞒啊
And I see you've been keeping secrets.

33
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,300
我并非有意欺骗您 威震天陛下
It was not my intention to deceive you, Lord Megatron.

34
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,510
我也是最近才发现自己的这种能力
I only recently became aware of my abilities.

35
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,480
但我本身的记忆只有猎杀…
All I remember of my beginning is hunting...

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,220
…和战斗…
and battling...

37
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,850
…以及被人羞辱
and the wounding of my pride.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,190
于是我便产生了疑问…
Thus I'd begun to burn with questions...

39
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,690
我是谁？
Who am I?

40
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,600
我从哪里来？
Where did I come from?

41
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,230
战舰上的数据库提供了一些史实依据
The warship's data banks provide historical fact

42
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,030
但是对于我的过去 我依然一无所知
but, still, I possessed no memory of my own past

43
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,190
于是我开始重新审视自己…
so I began to reconsider my place in the present...

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,180
更想知道“我是否也像其他人一样？”
and wondered "could I be like the others?"

45
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,520
而现在我知道了
And now I know.

46
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,360
你的确是个独一无二的科学奇迹
Yet you are unique, a miracle of science

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,560
是震荡波从提取的C.N.A.中克隆出来的
cloned by Shockwave from cybernucleic acid

48
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,050
从你那强大的祖先遗物中重生的奇迹
recovered from the remains of your mighty ancestors.

49
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,310
医生 你的合成能量研究目前进展如何？
Doctor, what is the current status of your Synthetic Energon experiments?

50
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,620
我一直在竭尽全力 指挥官
Doing the best I can, Commander.

51
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,620
哪怕是我缺乏趁手的设备
Given the lack of functional equipment at my disposal.

52
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,760
你应该明白替代能源对我们的生存至关重要吧？
You do realize that an alternative energy source may be essential to our survival?

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,460
呵…请相信我 通天晓
Heh... Believe me, Ultra Magnus.

54
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,850
没人能比我更了解这其中的利害关系
No one is more acutely aware of the stakes than I am.

55
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,850
呃…这是当然
Uhm... Of cause.

56
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,780
野兽猎人们 我想知道你们现在\N为什么不在305区域搜索巨狰狞骸骨？
Beast Hunters, may I ask why you are not currently scouting grid 305 for Predacon bones?

57
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,110
因为我们刚刚从301至304区域返回
Because we just returned from surveying grids 301 to 304.

58
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,280
以便根据您的规定去记录我们的实地报告\N通天晓指挥官 长官
To log our field reports, per your protocol, Commander Magnus, Sir.

59
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,670
士兵 我不记得批准过你离开基地
Soldier, I don't recall giving you permission to leave the base.

60
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,470
你的确没批准 长官
Because you didn't, Sir.

61
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,970
那为什么你的双手沾满冷却剂？
Why are your hands smeared with coolant?

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,760
我…我重新校准了你的飞船引擎
I... recalibrated your ship's engines.

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,100
你可以体验下矢量推力提升一成的感受了
You can expect a 10% increase in vector thrust.

64
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,000
- 欢迎回家！\N- 擎天柱！
- Welcome back!\N- Optimus.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,210
- 见到你真高兴！\N- 你回来真是太好了 擎天柱！
- Good to see you!\N- It's good to have you back, Optimus.

66
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,230
霸天虎没有活动迹象
Decepticon activity is at a lull.

67
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,310
因此 我担心威震天已经收齐了他想要的样本…
I fear that Megatron may have collected the specimens he requires to...

68
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,420
…来克隆他的军队
clone his army.

69
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,340
对您的再生之恩 我无以为报…
It is with deepest gratitude for my creation...

70
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,250
从今往后 定当效犬马之劳
that I pledge undying obedience to you.

71
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,650
我唯一的真正的主人
My one true master.

72
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,480
而考虑到我的种群在队伍中不断快速壮大
But with more of my species soon to stride among us

73
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,800
我请求您能允许我 作为冲云霄
I beg your permission to in turn, lead them

74
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,160
…来领导他们
as Predaking.

75
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,080
你倒是目光远大啊
Your vision is boundless.

76
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,350
这只曾经的野兽 或许眼下甘为奴仆
A former beast may fully believe himself to be a loyal servant today

77
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,350
但相信我 当有一天 我们这位王子殿下
but trust me, the moment our royal highness...

78
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,740
…发现他手下军队的战斗力已经能够…
realize that his army possesses greater might...

79
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,800
…凌驾于霸天虎残余部队之上时…
than what currently remains of the Decepticons.

80
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,430
进化…必将导致变革
Evolution... will give way to revolution.

81
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,420
我已别无选择…
I am left with no choice...

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,690
…只能在克隆巨狰狞造反之前根除他们
but to eradicate the Predacon clones before they are provided the opportunity to eradicate us.

83
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,060
威震天陛下 您不会是说要终止震荡波心爱的巨狰狞计划吧？
Lord Megatron, you're not saying you intend to pull the plug on Shockwave's beloved project Predacon?

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,810
您的结论最为合乎逻辑 我的君王
Your conclusion is most logical, my liege.

85
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,300
万一我们的背叛让那个喷火的兽人发觉了怎么办？
But what happens if that fire-breathing brute discovers our treachery?

86
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,230
干嘛非要认为我们得亲自动手呢？
Why assume that we will be the ones to perform the deed?

87
00:07:51,690 --> 00:08:00,050
毕竟 比如说 如果冲云霄发现是汽车人干掉了他的战友的话
After all, if the Predaking were to discover that, say, the Autobots were responsible for wiping out his comrades

88
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,870
我们手里的这只野兽说不定\N会反过来消灭那些我们所痛恨的敌人…
Our resident beast might, in turn, destroy our hated enemies for us...

89
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,120
…或是被消灭
or they him.

90
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,370
通天晓
Ultra Magnus.

91
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,510
你有烦心事了吧
Something has been troubling you.

92
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,080
我担心我的领导方式给部下的士气带来了负面影响
I fear that my command style may be having a negative effect on unit morale.

93
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,170
你是最忠于职守的 老朋友
Your service is most welcome, old friend.

94
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,220
但这里毕竟不是精英卫队
But this is not the Elite Guard.

95
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,580
塞博特恩之战后很多事情都发生了变化
Things have changed since the War for Cybertron.

96
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,670
而我们必须适应这种变化
And we must adapt to that change.

97
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,680
领袖卫队的成员并不只是一部机器中的齿轮
The members of Team Prime are not cogs in a machine.

98
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,900
他们已经获得了一种比军人更重要的身份
They've grown into something greater than an army.

99
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,910
他们已经成为…
They have become...

100
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,090
擎天柱 扫描装置探测到了露天能量矿
Optimus, our scanners have detected exposed energon.

101
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,710
鉴于我们的储备严重不足
With our reserves at a critical low

102
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,610
我们不能再放弃调查了
we cannot afford not to investigate.

103
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,400
霸天虎们 放下能量 立即投降
Decepticons, step away from the energon and surrender.

104
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,120
嘿呀！
Hia!

105
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,640
瞧瞧这些甜美的燃料
Look at all that sweet fuel.

106
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,300
潜行小队 把货物运送回基地
Stealth Team, transport our cargo back to base.

107
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,810
雷霆救援队 侦查矿脉
Wreckers, reconnoiter the mine.

108
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,780
我一直想跟雷霆救援队一起行动…
I've always wanted to roll with the Wreckers...

109
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,350
嗯…长官
Uh... Sir.

110
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,880
没有能量信号
No energon signals.

111
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,690
也没有加强戒备
And no additional security.

112
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,060
看起来很不对劲
Something doesn't smell right.

113
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,120
两两一组
Pair off.

114
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,330
好吧 这是丑八怪展览馆么
Well, this is one whole lot of ugly.

115
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,660
看来威震天的克隆计划比我们预期的要更快
Megatron's cloning operation seems further along than we anticipated.

116
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,700
红蜘蛛 汽车人来了
Starscream, the Autobots have arrived.

117
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,730
你没通知我 计划已经开始执行了
You did not inform me that your plan was already in motion.

118
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,010
假戏只有这样演才能…更乱真嘛
Only so the whole affair would appear less... staged.

119
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,870
我还没完全清除实验室的敏感数据
I have yet to purge my lab of sensitive materials.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,260
那你就快抓紧吧 震荡波 通话完毕
Then do not let me keep you, Shockwave. Over and out.

121
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,590
你其实是想整他 是吧？
You scrapped him on purpose, didn't you?

122
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,990
声波 我需要紧急开启环陆桥
Soundwave, I require an immediate ground bridge.

123
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:32,180
威震天陛下 看来巨狰狞计划已经落入汽车人手里了
Lord Megatron, it seems Project Predacon has fallen into Autobot's hands.

124
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,630
这怎么可能？！
How was this possible!?

125
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,700
红蜘蛛 紧急出动你的追踪者大军
Starscream, scramble your seeker and armada.

126
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,600
这就去 我的君王
At once, my liege.

127
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,230
不！
No!

128
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,170
如果我的弟兄们受到威胁 就该由我去直面敌人
If my brethren are imperiled, I will confront the enemy.

129
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,280
请求批准在密闭空间扔颗手雷 长官？
Permission to employ a grenade in a confined space, Sir?

130
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,960
如果只有我们两个能阻止 这些野兽屠戮这颗星球上的居民
If you and I are all that stand between these monsters and the natives of this planet

131
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,450
那么 只管动手 把这些野兽轰成渣
then, by all means, blow these beasts back to the rust age.

132
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,270
这家伙是谁？
Who's this guy?

133
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,170
就是之前曾放你一马的那个
The very same who has previously allowed you to live

134
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,700
不过这次可没门
But will not today.

135
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,500
他是那只巨狰狞
He is the Pradecon.

136
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,700
哇喔！怎么回事？
Wow! What was that?

137
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,510
你们对我的兄弟做了什么？！
What have you done to my brethren!?

138
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,850
你们究竟做了什么？！
What have you done!?

139
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,960
呀！
Yah!

140
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,160
呃…那好吧 我们耍一耍！
Umh... Well then, let's dance!

141
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,780
喔！
Woh!

142
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,520
呃！
Eh!

143
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,320
啊！哦！
Ah!... Oh!...

144
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,420
啊！！
Aah!!

145

嗯呃…
Uhm... eh...

147
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,770
呃！
Eh!...

148
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,890
唉…我刚刚开始能忍受你
Eh... and here, I was just beginning to tolerate you.

149
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,380
和你一起共事是我的荣幸 士兵
It's been an honor serving beside you, soldier.

150
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,450
准备受死吧

151
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,170
啊！
Awh!!!

152
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,330
什么？！不！！！
What!? No!!!

153
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,710
噢…

救护车会好好照顾你的

老通打架满有救援队范儿的
Magnus fought like a wrecker.

156
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,980
擎天柱 我们之前谈到过
Optimus, when we spoke earlier.

157
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,370
比军人更重要的身份是什么？
What could be greater than an army?

158
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,210
一个人类发明的词汇
A human concept.

159
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,170
这是我来到地球之后才懂得的…
one I have learned since coming to Earth...

160
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,200
家人
Family.

161
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,900
不要绝望嘛 冲云霄
Do not despair, my Predaking.

162
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,100
我向你保证…
For I vow to you...

163
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,490
…汽车人会为对你族群的恶行付出沉重代价的
that the Autobots will pay dearly for the outrage against your kind.

164
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,030
震荡波 汇报
Shockwave, report.

165
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,070
已经确认 我的君王 巨狰狞计划已毁于一旦
It is true, my liege. Project Predacon has been rendered null and void.

166
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
我已经无法再复活任何野兽个体
At least, I have been unable to recover any beast-forms.

167
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,800
不过 有些东西需要您亲自过目

170
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,520

这是爆炸产生的？

173
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,880
事实上 仅仅靠C.N.A.无法解释这种网状结构形成的原因
Indeed, yet the cybernucleic acid alone cannot account for these... cyber-forms.

174
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,500
所有符合逻辑的推断都指向了一个意外加入的因素…
All possible logic points to the presence of one unexpected variable...

175
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,350
