1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,390
你正被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,400
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,290
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,040
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because I built it.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,600
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,550
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything...

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,180
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,640
像你一样的普通人
people like you,

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,440
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,040
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,700
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,140
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,480
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,280
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,480
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,460
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
if your number's up, we'll find you.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,390

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,330
听说没  莫雷蒂要出狱了
Did you hear? Moretti's getting out of the slammer.

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,660
莫雷蒂  你认为以利亚知道吗
Moretti? Do you think Elias knows?

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,960
开什么玩笑  我以为这就是以利亚安排的
Kidding me? I think Elias arranged it.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,690
他想要莫雷蒂出来
Wants him out in the open.

22
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,340
你从哪儿冒出来的
Where the hell did you come from?

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,430
我想散散步
Felt like a walk.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,600
从曼哈顿散步出来80公里?
50 miles from Manhattan?

25
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,450
开门
Open the gate.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,830
别告诉我你是为了莫雷蒂而来
Don't tell me you're here for Moretti.

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,360
你怎么知道他要被释放了
How did you know he was being released?

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,770
早该猜到了
Should have guessed.

29
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,670
你一出现
Whenever you show up,

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,810
麻烦也就不远了
trouble's right around the corner.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,290
你有什么计划  卡特
What's your plan, Carter?

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,010
我可以给莫雷蒂提供保护
I got authority to offer Moretti protection.

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,200
作为交换  他要告诉我们
In exchange, he tells us

34
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,580
如何抓到纽约的头号公敌
how to get New York's public enemy number one.

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,960
他的亲生儿子
His own son.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,850
他的亲儿子以利亚
His own son Elias.

37
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,770
你在吗  芬奇
You there, Finch?

38
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,980
马上要走  看到莫雷蒂没有
Not for long. Have you seen Moretti?

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,770
他正开始享受自由的空气
Enjoying his first breath of freedom.

40
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,140
-你要出去吗  -刚得到一个号码
- You going somewhere? - Got another number

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,630
是社会保障局两个月前发放的
issued by the Social Security Administration two months ago

42
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,420
给了一个叫莉拉・史密斯的女人
to a woman named Leila Smith.

43
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,800
要么是新入籍的公民  要么是身份诈欺
Either a new citizen or a case of identity fraud.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,460
我只能找到一个工作地址
All I could find was a work address.

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,950
我们正在忙莫雷蒂的事  芬奇
We're working Moretti's number, Finch.

46
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,230
你得待在总部
I need you at HQ.

47
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,910
号码不等人  里瑟先生
The numbers don't wait in line, Mr. Reese.

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,210
保持联系
Be in touch.

49
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,630
卡特  纽约警察  记得我吗
Carter, NYPD. Remember me?

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,220
条子长得都一个样
Cops all look the same.

51
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,280
你清楚以利亚正在找你
You know Elias is looking for you.

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,630
-我没见着他  -暂时而已
- I don't see him. - Not yet.

53
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,960
我可以给你安排个安全的地方
But I could put you somewhere safe,

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,950
保你活下去
try to keep you alive.

55
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,740
现在我记起你了
Now I remember you now.

56
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,590
你是以利亚要杀的人
You're the one Elias wanted to kill.

57
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,210
那名我行我素的警察
The cop who's on her own.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,440
看来世道没怎么变啊
Looks like nothing's changed.

59
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,250
你不在这里工作  莉拉
You don't work here, Leila.

60
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,030
你是这里的病人
You're a patient.

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,230
知道他要去哪儿么
Any idea where he's going?

62
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,450
他以前在这里有一处房产
He used to own a house out here.

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,400
你好  我是提尔曼医生  找莉拉・史密斯
Hello, I'm Dr. Tillman, here to see Leila Smith.

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,930
阿戴里安医生让我检查她支气管炎的状况
Dr. Adalian asked me to check the status of her bronchitis.

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,450
她现在基本痊愈了
She's pretty well over that by now.

66
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,620
尽管如此  你有她的表格么
Nonetheless. Do you have her chart for me?

67
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,420
她在这儿
Here she is.

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,190
我们的小天使
Our own little angel.

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,180
没写她的父母是谁
No parents listed.

70
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,360
莉拉是被放在安全岛的弃婴
Oh, Leila's a safe-haven baby.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,590
阿戴里安医生在诊所外面发现的她
Dr. Adalian himself found her outside the clinic.

72
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,700
谁给她申请的社保号
So who applied for her social security number?

73
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
是我
That was me.

74
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,890
我希望国家知道莉拉是谁
I wanted to be sure the state knew who Leila was,

75
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,620
即使她父母完全不在乎
even if her own parents didn't care.

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,330
通常情况下她应该已经被送养了
Normally she'd be given up for adoption by now,

77
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,780
但她有支气管炎之类的疾病
but she had medical issues like her bronchitis.

78
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,040
她会很快找到一个家的
She'll find a home soon.

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,940
谢谢你  护士
Thank you, nurse.

80
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,090
你好  莉拉
Hello, Leila.

81
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,670
这世界上会有谁居然想伤害你
Now who in the world would want to hurt you?

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,410
我们来找莉拉・史密斯
We're here for Leila Smith.

83
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,610
要把她转到另一家诊所
Here to transfer her to another clinic.

84
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,440
里瑟先生  我这里有情况
Mr. Reese, I think I have a situation.

85
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,200
我也是  等下打给你
Me too. I have to get back to you.

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,300
这边走
This way.

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,430
像是出了事故
Looks like an accident.

88
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,280
绕开它们
Go around them.

89
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,480
求你了  能帮帮我们吗
Please, can you help us?

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,920
继续开
Keep going.

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,480
-出来  -警察  放下武器
- Get out! - Police! Drop your weon.

92
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,000
快  我们走
Come on, let's go.

93
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,890
我听说了事情的经过
I heard what happened.

94
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,420
你应该庆幸她在场  莫雷蒂先生
You're very lucky she was there, Mr. Moretti.

95
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,390
是啊  你是谁
Yeah. Who are you?

96
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,170
舍曼斯基警探
Detective Szymanski.

97
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,310
又一个警察
Another cop.

98
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,830
我必须待在这里吗
Do I have to stay here?

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,480
你是自由身  吉亚尼
You're a free man, Gianni.

100
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,690
你随时可以出去吃子弹
You can walk out of here and into a bullet anytime,

101
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,070
或者留下来帮我们抓住以利亚
or you can stay and help us get Elias before he gets you.

102
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,470
一个东躲西藏的黑手党老头子
A mafia don in hiding.

103
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,100
你打算向上级汇报吗
You plan on clearing this with your bosses?

104
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,420
已经汇报过了
It's already cleared.

105
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,450
以利亚没有掌控我们整个部门
Elias doesn't own the whole department--

106
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,620
目前还没
Not yet.

107
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,730
还有几个像舍曼斯基这样的好警察
Still a few good cops like Szymanski in there,

108
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,240
想要抓住以利亚
who want Elias taken down

109
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,790
而莫雷蒂就是最好的途径
and think Moretti is the best way to do it.

110
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,130
不管怎样
Anyway...

111
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,840
多谢你了
Thank you.

112
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,460
不客气
You're welcome.

113
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,500
别惹麻烦
Stay out of trouble.

114
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,710
芬奇  那边怎么样
Hey, Finch. How's it going?

115
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,560
就那样
It's going.

116
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,120
莫雷蒂情况如何
What about Moretti?

117
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,880
以利亚给他准备了一个出狱派对
Elias had a getting-out-of-jail party planned.

118
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,150
我们捣毁了它
We crashed it.

119
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,540
另一个号码情况如何  芬奇
What happened with the other number, Finch?

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,830
舌头打结了
Cat got your tongue?

121
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,240
我可能行事有点草率了
I'm afraid I may have done something rather rash.

122
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,300
什么叫草率了
What do you mean by "Rash"?

123
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,980
那是你的领带吗  芬奇
Is this one of your ties, Finch?

124
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,880
你还是给她点吃的  而不是你穿过的衣服
I hope you gave her some food and not just your hand-me-downs.

125
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,510
她喜欢鸡肉和梅干
Chicken and prunes is her favorite.

126
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,030
听着  有点恶心
Sounds, disgusting.

127
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,340
但怎么会有人想要杀她
But why on earth would anyone want to kill her?

128
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,760
我倒没觉得有人想要杀她
Somehow I don't see anyone planning a murder here.

129
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,850
我推测  如果他们成功绑架了她
My guess is that, if they were successful in kidnapping her,

130
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,690
会把她偷渡出国
they'd smuggle her out of the country

131
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,390
把她扔进孤儿院
and dump her in an orphanage.

132
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,320
扔到某个有很多小孩
Somewhere where babies are plentiful

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,010
却又缺乏出生记录的地方
and birth records aren't.

134
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,930
但是他们为什么想摆脱掉她
But why do they want to get rid of her?

135
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,720
她或许是一桩私情的证据
She might be evidence of an affair,

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,130
或者阻碍了某人
or she might be an obstacle to someone

137
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,630
获得巨额遗产
getting a big, fat legacy.

138
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,400
但到底是谁  我还没有头绪
As for who they are, I have no idea.

139
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,570
不过由于她让我一晚没睡
But since she kept me up all night,

140
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,490
我查了诊所的财务
I looked into the clinic's finances.

141
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,260
他们收到一份大礼
They received a big gift.

142
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,440
莉拉出生前5万美金
$50,000 just about the time Leila was born

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,530
此后每月都有1万美金
and $10,000 every month since then.

144
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,930
捐赠者是谁
Who's the donor?

145
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,570
匿名
Anonymous.

146
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,420
我以国税局的名义发了一份措辞严厉的邮件
I sent the clinic a sternly worded email from the IRS

147
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,350
要求查看捐赠者的税收账号
demanding the donor's tax ID number

148
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,460
威胁他们如果不尽快答复
and threatening to review their charitable status

149
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,510
就要审查他们的慈善运营资格  等着瞧吧
if they didn't answer quickly. We'll see how that works.

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,820
{\an8}纽约警局
儿童绑架
莉拉・史密斯

151
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,860

156
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,530
倒不算恭维你  芬奇  不过你比画像好看
It's not very flattering, Finch, but better than the picture

157
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,830
难怪他们靠这个从来抓不到人
It's no wonder they never catch anybody with these things.

158
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,170
你觉得卡特能帮我们打探警方的调查吗
You think Carter can piggyback the police investigation?

159
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,660
我去问她
I'll ask her.

160
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,570
你可以好好陪陪莉拉
You can spend some quality time with Leila.

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,640
警探

162
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,070
莫雷蒂先生告诉你以利亚的情况了吗
Has Mr. Moretti given you anything on Elias?

163
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,660
还没有  不过  我们还在努力
Not yet, but, um, we're working on him.

164
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,500
你买婴儿用品干什么
Who you buying that stuff for?

165
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,850
我想和你谈的就是这个
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

166
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,680
一个婴儿昨晚在华盛顿高地一个诊所失踪了
A baby went missing from a clinic in Washington Heights last night.

167
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,330
失踪  是被偷了
Missing? It was stolen...

168
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,230
被一个长得奇形怪状的
It was stolen by some weird-looki--

169
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,400
不是吧
No.

170
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,570
你不是吧
You didn't.

171
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,700
她正处在被绑架的极度危险中
She was in imminent danger of kidnap.

172
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,890
所以你就绑架了她吗
So you kidnapped her?

173
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,060
你知道你被安珀警报通缉了吧
You know there's an Amber Alert out on you.

174
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,020
是的  所以我们需要你的帮助
Yes, and that's why we need your help.

175
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,010
帮助  我该逮捕你
Help? I should arrest you.

176
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,560
那孩子现在在哪里
Where's the baby anyway?

177
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,070
莉拉很安全  她和约翰在一起
Leila's safe. She's with John.

178
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,260
约翰  约翰  你居然放心他带孩子
John? John? You trust him with a baby?

179
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,500
我知道这样不太好
I realize it's not ideal.

180
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,170
所以我们越快解决问题越好
So the sooner we can resolve this, the better.

181
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,700
你还要我做些什么
What do you want me to do?

182
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,930
除了不逮捕你以外
Apart from not arresting you.

183
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,540
去诊所
Go to the clinic.

184
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,140
看看能不能找到莉拉父母的信息
See what you can find out about Leila's parents.

185
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,390
我听说她是被放在安全岛的弃婴
I heard she was a safe-haven baby.

186
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,200
诊所是不会有她父母的信息的
Clinic's not going to have that information.

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,300
我想他们比声称的知道得多
I think they know more than they claim.

188
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,680
去找艾博特护士谈谈
Talk to a nurse Abbot.

189
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,130
她似乎特别喜欢莉拉
She seemed especially fond of Leila.

190
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,680
恭喜
Congratulations.

191
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,400
是第一个孩子吗
Is it your first?

192
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,580
这就是你青春驻颜的秘诀吗
That how you keep your boyish figure?

193
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,350
有种咬我
Bite me.

194
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,360
听说了吗  吉亚尼・莫雷蒂昨天出狱后
Did you hear Gianni Moretti got out of prison yesterday

195
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,820
人间蒸发了
then vanished?

196
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,150
国民警卫队找到了五具混混的尸体
All state police found was five dead goombas.

197
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,490
暴徒自相残杀  悲剧啊
Mobsters killing each other-- How tragic.

198
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,700
不过那儿不止有暴徒
Except it wasn't just mobsters.

199
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,450
你的搭档也在
Your partner was there too.

200
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,280
卡特吗
Carter?

201
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,630
似乎她和几个愣头青
Looks like she and a couple of cowboys

202
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,710
去执行某个未记录在案的破任务了
got some kind of rinky-dink off-book operation.

203
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,640
他们把莫雷蒂藏起来了
They've hidden Moretti.

204
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
我们要知道他藏哪儿了
We want to find out where.

205
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,890
HR找不到他
HR can't find out?

206
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,200
还以为你们的爪牙遍布各处呢
Thought you guys had your fingers in all the pies.

207
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,870
你就是其中一个  弗斯科
You are one of the pies, Fusco.

208
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,980
找出她把莫雷蒂藏哪儿了
Find out where she's got Moretti stashed.

209
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,500
就跟我和其他警探说的一样
Like I told the other detectives,

210
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,640
我们没有莉拉的父母的信息
we don't know about the parents.

211
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,770
莉拉被遗弃在诊所外面
Leila was just left outside the clinic.

212
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,150
她身上有什么东西吗
Was there anything found on Leila?

213
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,860
我是阿戴里安医生  你是哪位
I'm Dr. Adalian. Who are you?

214
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,060
-卡特警探  特殊受害者小组的  -警探
- Detective Carter, SVU. - Detective.

215
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,440
我想艾博特护士已经解释过了
As I'm sure nurse Abbot explained,

216
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,070
我们并不知道莉拉的父母是谁
we don't know where Leila came from.

217
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,570
你们一定留下了什么东西
You must have kept something.

218
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,900
比如  她的衣服  或是包着她的毯子
Like, what about her clothes, her blankets?

219
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,700
没有  安全岛条律的目的是保护新生儿
No. The, Safe-haven Law was designed to protect newborns

220
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,820
而不是指控父母
not prosecute their parents.

221
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,810
我们的工作不是抓人
It's not our job to hunt people down.

222
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,940
谢谢
Thank you.

223
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,140
我很抱歉

224
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,790
等一下
Excuse me.

225
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,830
我关心的只是莉拉
All I care about is Leila.

226
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,420
如果你想起了什么  打给我
If you can think of anything, call me.

227
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,580
拜托了
Please.

228
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,710
这片粘在这里  那片粘在那里  看到没
This flap here, that flap there, see?

229
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,030
干净整洁多简单
Neat and simple.

230
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,750
你在麻省理工的书果然没白念
I see your time at MIT wasn't wasted.

231
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,710
太好菜了  诊所的会计师发邮件来了
Excellent. The accountants at the clinic have coughed up

232
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,170
是他们捐献人的税号
the tax ID numbers of their donor.

233
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,050
没什么比国税局更可怕了
Nothing like a fear of the IRS to produce results.

234
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,740
税号属于彼得罗辛建筑公司
Tax ID belongs to Petrosian Construction.

235
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,340
公司所有人是
Company owned by...

阿德南・彼得罗辛
Adnan Petrosian.

237
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,370
我们只要扒扒大众媒体的
And if we dive into that swamp of indiscretion

238
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,630
八卦资讯
known as social media,

239
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,120
就会发现
we will learn that...

240

244
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,500
这个巴巴

245
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,220
还是这个巴巴
Or dadda?

246
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,560
严肃点  里瑟先生
Be serious, Mr. Reese.

247
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,350
你去接近他们一家
I need you to get close to this family.

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,900
芬奇
Hey, Finch.

249
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,100
监视已经搞定  正在装监听
Got eyes on the Petrosians, getting ears.

250
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,140
他们是真正的富人  芬奇
These guys have serious money, Finch.

251
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,990
你们的一家俱乐部可能是同一家
You probably go to the same country club.

252
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,400
即使如此
Be that as it may,

253
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,060
他们看起来像是丢了宝宝的样子吗
do they seem like a family that's lost a baby?

254
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,980
你搞臭了家族的名誉
Behavior has damaged this family's good name,

255
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,900
我已经花了那么多钱帮你摆脱麻烦了
and I've already spent a fortune getting you out of trouble.

256
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,140
很抱歉让你脸上无光了  爸爸

257
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,990
布兰得利  我想知道  就这一个
Bradley, I want to know, is this it,

258
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,620
还是有别的麻烦在等着
or are there more unpleasant surprises?

259
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,030
全都搞定了  好吗
It's been taken care of, okay?

260
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,610
看起来是父母在掩护他们的儿子
Looks like mommy and daddy are covering up for the son.

261
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,730
来点美味的牛奶好不好
How about a delicious bottle?

262
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,370
芬奇  你有在听吗
Finch, are you listening?

263
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,990

卡特警探的电话

265
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,960
请让特殊受害者小组的卡特警探接电话好吗
Can I have Detective Carter, SVU?

266
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,110
卡特是凶案组的亲  不是特殊受害者小组的
Carter works Homicide, sweetheart, not SVU.

267
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,590
我是卡特  有什么能帮到您的吗
This is Carter. How can I help you?

268
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,740
我是玛丽・艾博特
It's Mary Abbot.

269
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,830
刚才那个男的说你是凶案组的
The man on the phone said you worked Homicide.

270
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,400
别听他的  他是新来的
Oh, don't worry about him. He's new here.

271
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,930
有什么能帮到你的吗  玛丽
How could I help you, Mary?

272
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,160
当时莉拉身上的确有东西  一条手链
Leila did have something on her when she arrived--a bracelet

273
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,690
你还保管着吗
Do you still have it?

274
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,310
我给了主任  阿戴里安医生
I gave it to the director, Dr. Adalian.

275
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,780
我问过他  可是他说他不记得了
I asked him, but he said he didn't remember.

276
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,260
是什么样的手链
What did it look like?

277
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,930
是银的
It was silver,

278
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,610
上面有两个缩写  CC
with two initials carved on it. CC.

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,500
好的  警探

找到个在彼得罗辛办公室工作的人缩写叫CC

凯莉・克罗斯威尔

284
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,620
但她58了  搞外遇有点偏老
But she's 58-- a little old for a fling.

285
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,040
我正在比对彼得罗辛建筑公司的雇员名单
Now I'm checking employee files at Petrosian Construction.

286
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,590
你黑进了人家公司
You hacked into his company?

287
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,990
"黑进"这词真难听
"Hacked" is such an ugly word.

288
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,620
又找到了两个缩写叫CC的人

8个月前她结束了与彼得罗辛的雇佣关系
Employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago,

295
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,190
那会儿正好是她肚子显形的时候
just when her pregnancy would have started to show.

296
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,820
给我地址  我去跟她谈谈
Get me an address. I'll go and talk to her.

297
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,510
谈不了  她死了
No, you won't. She's dead.

298
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,420
一份犯罪现场报告上有她的名字

300
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,330
法医当意外事故处理的
ME ruled it as an accident.

301
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,350
真可爱  可以跟她打招呼吗
Aw, cute. Can we say Hi?

302
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,200
太萌了
Oh, she's so adorable.

303
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,510
你好啊  小可爱
Hi, honey.

304
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,790
-看她笑的  -谢谢  再见
- Look at that smile. - Thanks. Bye.

305
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,310
你居然随身带着她
You brought her with you?

306
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,320
整个城市的警察都在找她
Every cop in the city is looking for that kid.

307
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,830
我在教她怎么掩护自己
I'm teaching her to go undercover.

308
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,790
她天生就擅长
She's a natural.

309
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,790
她是小天使
She's a little angel.

310
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,040
要是她出了事  约翰  上帝救救我吧
Something happens to her, John, so help me, God--

311
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,190
我们正努力阻止坏事发生
We're trying to stop anything from happening.

312
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,270
我们知道她待在彼得罗辛家族资助的诊所
We know she was in a clinic funded by the Petrosians,

313
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,430
而她妈妈曾经为那个家族工作
and we know her mother worked for the Petrosians.

314
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,770
她生父很可能是彼得罗辛家族成员之一
So it's probable that the father is one of the Petrosians.

315
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,470
但她母亲为什么会死于意外呢
But why does mom end up dead?

316
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,230
或许她之前同意把孩子送去让人领养
Maybe she agreed to give her up for adoption,

317
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,890
却又改变了主意  想要留下孩子
then changed her mind, said she wanted to keep it.

318
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,120
这会使整件事曝光
Well, that would expose the whole thing.

319
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,020
DNA会证明孩子父亲是谁
DNA would prove who the father was.

320
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,090
他得供养这个孩子
He'd have to provide for the baby.

321
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,190
-家族会受损失  -这是动机
- The family would lose out. - It's motive.

322
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,240
做掉母亲
Bump off the mom,

323
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,710
让孩子失踪  问题解决了
make the baby disappear, problem solved.

324
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,430
我们得查查克劳迪娅
We need to find out if Claudia's death

325
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,180
是否真的死于意外
really was an accident.

326
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,390
我已经找出尸检和犯罪现场调查报告
I already pulled the autopsy and crime scene reports.

327
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,180
我会跟一名朋友一起去检查现场
I want to look through them with a mentor of mine.

328
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,460
-他在消防部门工作  -很好
- Works for the Fire Department. - Good.

329
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,840
我去看看克劳迪娅的父母有没有任何线索
I'll see if Claudia's parents know anything.

330
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,910
约翰继续跟踪布兰得利・彼得罗辛
John will follow Bradley Petrosian.

331
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,060
我得先喂饱莉拉
After I've fed Leila.

332
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,470
再见啦
Bye-bye.

333
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,420
克鲁兹夫人  我是卢卡斯・班纳特
Mrs. Cruz. Lucas Bennet.

334
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,450
家庭事务部的
Department of Family Services.

335
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,400
他说是为克劳迪娅的事情而来
He says he's here about Claudia.

336
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,330
请节哀顺变
I'm very sorry for your loss.

337
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,770
您为何而来
Why are you here?

338
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,740
我们接到一个报告...
We had a report, um...

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,850
来自克劳迪娅的一位邻居  匿名的
from a neighbor of Claudia's-- an anonymous report--

340
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,540
说她怀孕了
that she was pregnant.

341
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,830
她没有  谁说的
She was not. Tell me who said that.

342
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,630
对不起  克鲁兹先生  这是匿名消息
Please, Mr. Cruz, the source is anonymous.

343
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,600
我们需要进行调查
We have to investigate.

344
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,330
好吧
Okay.

345
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,970
克劳迪娅没有怀孕
Claudia wasn't pregnant.

346
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,290
我是她母亲  我们无话不谈
I'm her mother. We talked about everything.

347
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,590
克劳迪娅什么时候搬进那套公寓的
When did Claudia move into her apartment?

348
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,430
大概是九个月前  怎么了
About nine months ago. Why?

349
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,870
正好那会儿她离开了
About the same time that she stopped working

350
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,970
彼得罗辛建筑公司
at Petrosian Construction?

351
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,420
那段时间你们见过她吗
Did you see her during that period?

352
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,960
有好几个月都没见她了
Not for a few months, no.

353
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,500
她似乎不太愿意我们去看她
She was kind of funny about us coming around.

354
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,710
克劳迪娅是不是有条银手链
Did Claudia have a silver bracelet?

355
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,570
没错  上面有她的首字母
Yes, with her initials on it.

356
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,290
她很小的时候我母亲送给她的
My mother gave it to her when she was a baby.

357
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,260
拜托  有什么就说吧
Please, just tell us.

358
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,500
她真的怀孕了吗  她有孩子了吗
Was she pregnant? Did she have a baby?

359
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,820
我们认为有可能
We believe it's possible.

360
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,670
这孩子在哪儿  我们能见见吗
Then where is it? Can we see it?

361
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,160
我可以居中安排你们相见
I can try to arrange a meeting on neutral ground,

362
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,020
但是这事情得保密
but it would have to be kept confidential.

363
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,720
没问题
Of course.

364
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,320
有其他克劳迪娅的事可以告诉我吗
What else can you tell me about Claudia?

365
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,830
譬如说  她在恋爱吗
Was she in a relationship, for example?

366
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,890
她死前一个月曾经留了些文件在家
She left some papers here about a month before she died.

367
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,300
我们发现了这个
We found this.

368
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,850
我觉得这是彼得罗辛的儿子布兰得利
I think he's Mr. Petrosian's son Bradley.

369
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,390
有发现吗  里瑟先生
Any luck, Mr. Reese?

370
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,360
布兰得利・彼得罗辛是个好学生
Bradley Petrosian has been a good student.

371
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,250
没给任何人打过电话
Hasn't phoned anyone,

372
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,610
没跟任何可疑人物交谈过
hasn't spoken to any suspicious characters.

373
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,970
这么说我们找错对象了
So are we barking up the wrong tree?

374
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,360
有可能
Maybe.

375
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,540
等等
Hang on.

376
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,310
他正跟人见面
He's meeting someone.

377
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,660
芬奇...
Finch...

378
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,390
你说的没错  我们找错对象了
You were right about the wrong tree.

379
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,680
什么意思
What?

380
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,920
我不认为布兰德利・彼得罗辛
I don't think Bradley Petrosian

381
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,980
跟克劳迪娅・克鲁兹有一腿
was sleeping with Claudia Cruz.

382
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,460
什么意思
Sorry?

383
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,770
他在性趣方面另有所好
His tastes run in the other direction.

384
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,360
那我们应该查查他父亲  阿德南
So we should look at the father, Adnan.

385
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,050
我去盯住他
I'll get eyes on him.

386
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,990
孩子现在怎么样
How's their baby doing?

387
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,730
她很
She's--

388
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,970
里瑟  你最好过来
Reese, you better get back here.

389
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,400
合情合理  这里有很多蜡烛
Makes sense. Lots of candles.

390
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,480
有一支弄到了呢绒上
One catches the drapes.

391
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,060
知道为什么克劳迪娅没逃走吗
Do we know why Claudia didn't run?

392
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,280
血液检查有酒精残余
Blood screen showed traces of alcohol.

393
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,290
这么说她喝醉了  睡着了
So she was drinking. She fell asleep.

394
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,740
烟雾警报器失效了
Faulty smoke alarm.

395
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,320
消防局长说电池没电了
Fire Marshal said the battery was dead.

396
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,480
问题不是电池  是电线
Battery isn't the problem. Wiring is.

397
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,520
电线上只剩下一层塑料涂料
The hot wire is just plastic coating.

398
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,370
里边的电线被拿走了
The wire itself was removed.

399
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,440
没有线路连接  所以没有报警
No connection, no alarm.

400
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,940
如果是电池没电  就是意外  但这个
Dead battery could be an accident, but this--

401
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,440
你有验尸的照片吗
You got the autopsy photos?

402
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,490
有
Yeah.

403
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,290
法医说裂口是高温造成的  不是外伤
ME said heat caused the cracks, not trauma.

404
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,550
高温的确能导致头骨裂开
High temperatures can cause the skull to fissure.

405
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,750
裂口沿着骨头缝裂开的
Cracks all along the plate lines of the skull.

406
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,480
头骨上没有自然形成的缝  但是
There is no natural plate line there, but--

407
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,450
-这是因为殴打造成的  -没错
- It was caused by a blow. - Yeah.

408
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,470
着火的时候她已经昏迷了
She was unconscious when the fire was set.

409
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,850
用什么打的
But a blow with what?

410
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,390
骨头裂开了
Bone was cracked.

411
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,260
但是没有穿透  也没有粉碎
Wasn't pierced or shattered.

412
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,810
是圆的东西
Something round.

413
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,890
比如这个
Like this?

414
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,700
有可能
Could be.

415
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,870
把烟灰弄掉后  可能会有发现
You wash the soot off that, you might get lucky.

416
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,580
高温能够将附着的指纹刻在金属上
Heat can etch fingerprints into the metal.

417
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,310
或许能告诉你谁是凶手
Could give you your killer.

418
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,780
-你怎会把她弄丢呢  -我没有
- But how could you let her go? - I didn't.

419
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,200
她撞倒了书本  自己走开了
She just knocked down the books and walked off.

420
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,860
她不会走路  芬奇
She can't walk, Finch.

421
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,910
上帝
God.

422
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,030
我永远不会原谅自己
I'll never forgive myself.

423
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,100
快交给我  莉拉
Give it to me now, Leila.

424
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,460
-拜托交给我  -你找到她了
- Please just give it to me. - You got her?

425
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,610
上帝  那是个手榴弹
My God, that's a grenade.

426
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,900
拜托快点
Please just--

427
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,630
只是个催泪弹
Just a tear gas grenade.

428
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,840
还是个手榴弹
It's still a grenade.

429
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,210
没事的  没事的  小宝贝
You're okay. You're okay, sweetie.

430
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,290
过来  没事的
Come on. It's okay.

431
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,400
我早叫你把武器搬走
I told you to move your arsenal.

432
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,060
-我准备搬了  -什么时候
- I was going to. - When?

433
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,470
等这里被炸平后吗
After the whole place is blown up?

434
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,550
你知道我不喜欢枪
You know how I feel about guns.

435
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,960
总这样不行
This really isn't working,

436
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,010
我们俩总得留下一人  专门照顾她
one of us always being here, minding the baby.

437
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,640
是你把她偷过来的
Well, you're the one who stole her.

438
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,060
多谢提醒
Thanks for reminding me of that.

439
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,110
我要把她送到她外祖父母那里去
I'm gonna take her to her grandparents.

440
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,690
在我们扫除威胁照看她
They can keep an eye on her until we neutralize the threat.

441
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,340
芬奇  坏人找上了克劳迪娅
Finch, the bad guys got to Claudia.

442
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,170
叔叔抱
Here we go.

443
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,590
他们也可能找上萨米和韦达
They could be after Sammy and Veda too.

444
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,980
所以我已经把他们转移到安全屋了
That's why I've already moved them to a safe house.

445
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
怎么  撇开我自己查案了
What, are you working a case without me?

446
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,020
只是一起意外死亡  有可能转为
Just an accidental death, which might turn out

447
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,740
-定性成凶案  -是谁
- to be a homicide. - Who is it?

448
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,980
一个叫克劳迪娅・克鲁兹的姑娘
A girl named Claudia Cruz.

449
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,670
我刚从犯罪现场回来
Just left the crime scene.

450
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,620
可能发现了凶器
Might have found the murder weapon.

451
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,270
舍曼斯基
Szymanski.

452
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,070
真是抱歉  我刚才有点事
I am so sorry. I got caught up.

453
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,770
我会尽快赶到的
I'll be there as soon as possible.

454
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,030
我能帮什么忙吗
Anything I can do to help?

455
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,320
能帮我把这些送去罪证化验室吗
Think you could take these down to the Crime Lab for me,

456
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,690
叫他们马上处理
ask them to put a rush on it?

457
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,940
没问题
Yeah, sure.

458
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,290
-多谢了  -只有这些吗
- Thanks. - But is that it?

459
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,310
舍曼斯基不是集团犯罪科的吗
Szymanski-- Isn't he Organized Crime?

460
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,390
卡特  你清楚我是你的人  对吧
Carter, you know I got your back, right?

461
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,720
舍曼斯基约我出去
Szymanski asked me out on a date.

462
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,860
拜托别跟别人乱说  好吗
Can you not spread it around, please?

463
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,070
我尽量
I'll try not to.

464
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,120
你接着做事
Look, why don't you go ahead

465
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,510
我把这个送去化验室  好吧
and I'll run this down to the lab, all right?

466
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,790
谢了  莱奈尔
Thanks, Lionel.

467
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,240
欠你一回
I owe you.

468
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,230
我去检查一下是否安全
I'll check if it's clear.

469
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,020
芬奇
Finch!

470
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,030
查到什么了
What did you get?

471
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,890
他们车上有全球定位追踪器
There was a GPS tracker on their car.

472
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,630
这不是你们的错
It's not your fault.

473
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,280
很抱歉你们还未脱离险境
I'm sorry you're still in danger.

474
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,020
我们还得再转移你们
We have to move you again.

475
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,010
你们去收拾下东西好吗
Can you get your things?

476
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,210
如果我们今天晚上救不了莉拉
If we don't recover Leila tonight,

477
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,790
她会被送离这个国家
she'll be out of the country.

478
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,730
永远消失
Gone for good.

479
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,590
知道这些人的来历吗
Any idea who those men were?

480
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,790
不是阿尔巴尼亚人就是克罗地亚人
They're Albanians or Croats.

481
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,930
也许是某个东欧犯罪集团
Probably one of the Eastern European crime groups.

482
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,310
你准备怎么做
What are you gonna do?

483
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,320
不惜一切代价
Whatever I have to.

484
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,550
为什么我看到的
How come I only ever see

485
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,190
不是你就是舍曼斯基
you or Szymanski?

486
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,310
如果以利亚至关重要
If this Elias is such a big deal,

487
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,320
纽约警局的其他人上哪儿去了
where's the rest of the NYPD?

488
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,980
你记性真差啊  吉亚尼
You got a bad memory, Gianni.

489
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,860
以利亚极力想做掉你
Elias just tried to kill you.

490
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,650
越多警察知道你在这儿
The more cops know you're here,

491
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,390
他能找到你的可能性就越大
the more chance of him finding you.

492
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,150
为了你自己好  先帮我们找到他
So for your own sake, help us find him first.

493
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,430
卡特
Carter.

494
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,600
卡特  我刚从化验室出来
Hey, Carter, yeah, I was in the Crime Lab.

495
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,340
他们说你给了他们个紧急任务
They said they had a rush job for you

496
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,890
查卡劳迪娅・克鲁兹案里的一个凶器
on some murder weapon in a Claudia Cruz case.

497
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,440
有发现吗
They get anything?

498
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,240
他们找到了配对  凶手有案底
Yep, they got a match. Your killer was in the system,

499
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,050
多亏十年前的一起公路纠纷事件
thanks to a road rage incident about ten years ago.

500
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,590
是谁
What's the name?

501
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,170
你是谁  你在干...
Who are you? What do you--

502
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,270
保安
Security!

503
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,770
-她在哪儿  -什么  谁
- Where is she? - What? Who?

504
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,680
这东西的所有人绑架了莉拉
The owner of this kidnapped Leila.

505
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,540
告诉我他把莉拉带哪儿去了
Tell me where he's taken her.

506
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,740
我不知道  我向上帝发誓我不知道
I don't know. I swear to God I don't.

507
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,400
你和克劳迪娅・克鲁兹有外遇  不是吗
You had an affair with Claudia Cruz, didn't you?

508
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,370
好吧  是的
Okay. Yes.

509
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,080
你杀了克劳迪娅
You had Claudia killed

510
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,180
-绑架了她的宝宝  -没有
- and the baby kidnapped. - No.

511
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,240
我不可能干出那种事
I would never do anything like that.

512
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,880
你想怎样  严刑逼供吗
What are you gonna do, torture him?

513
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,810
你已经触发了无声警报
You've tripped the silent alarm.

514
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,520
{\an8}卡特
谋杀克劳迪娅的凶手找到了
凶器上有妻子的指纹

515
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,520
警察会在五分钟内赶到
The police are gonna be here in five minutes.

516
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,620
我不会对他严刑逼供的
I'm not gonna torture him

517
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,880
因为是你的指纹印在
because your fingerprints are on the weapon

518
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,940
杀害克劳迪娅的凶器上
that killed Claudia.

519
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,950
-尼可娜  你做了什么  -闭嘴
- Nicola, what did you do? - Shut up.

520
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,550
是你雇人抢走了莉拉  是不是
Did you hire the men that took Leila? Did you?

521
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,820
没错
Yes.

522
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,300
-给他们打电话  -我做不到
- Call them. - I can't.

523
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,360
号码已经停机了
The number doesn't work anymore.

524
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,520
-你从哪儿弄到的  -某个欧洲的家族
- Where'd you get it? - Family in Europe.

525
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,760
我打了电话  一个男人接的
I called it. A man answered.

526
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,830
我跟他说了我的麻烦
I told him the problem.

527
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,360
我一付完款  号码就会作废
Once I paid him, he said the number would be dead.

528
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,500
我联系不到他  更没法中止任务
And I couldn't contact him, not even to stop the job.

529
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,490
任务就是要把克劳迪娅的死亡
And the job was to make Claudia's death

530
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,670
伪装成意外
look like an accident,

531
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,200
再摆脱掉孩子
get rid of the baby.

532
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,840
你怎么能这么做
How could you do such a thing?

533
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,130
总得有人给你收拾烂摊子
Somebody had to clean up your mess.

534
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,010
你无能无力了  他们已经走了
And there's nothing you can do. They're gone.

535
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,050
我要找这个东西的所有人
I want the man that owns this.

536
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,880
他绑架了一个孩子
He has kidnapped a child,

537
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,800
一名婴儿
a baby.

538
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,420
我想知道他在哪儿
I want to know where he is.

539
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,880
玩真格的吗
Really?

540
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,680
再问一次
One more time.

541
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,600
-我怎么能找到他  -我不知道
- How do I find him? - I don't know.

542
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,580
我会杀了你
I will kill you.

543
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,730
杀了我吧  我还是不知道
So kill me, but I still don't know.

544
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,250
你的小宝贝已经被带走了
Your baby's gone.

545
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,070
抢走孩子的人肯定已经转手了
Whoever he was just handed him over.

546
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,070
他自己都不知道了
Even he couldn't tell you.

547
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,410
来啊
So go ahead.

548
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,490
开枪啊
Shoot.

549
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,380
就是说没人知道她在哪儿
So no one knows where she is.

550
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,700
也不是没人
Not no one.

551
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,910
有一个人掌控黑社会
There is someone who knows the underworld,

552
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,340
战士  黑帮  集团大鳄
the soldiers, the gangs, the syndicates.

553
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,440
拜托  你在开玩笑
Come on, you're not serious.

554
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,340
你还留着那个电话吧
You still have that burner phone?

555
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,840
不行  我们不能用那个
No, we can't use it.

556
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,560
莉拉在那些人手里
Leila is in the hands of men

557
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,690
事情有变他们会眼睛不眨地杀了她
who won't hesitate to kill her if things go bad.

558
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,450
这是在铤而走险
It's still too risky.

559
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,950
能试的我都试了  芬奇
I'm all out of moves, Finch.

560
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,250
剩下的也只有铤而走险了
Risk is all I've got left.

561
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,150
我必须打这个电话
I have to make the call.

562
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,210
他凭什么会同意和你见面
Why would he even agree to meet with you?

563
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,000
因为他会好奇
Because he'll be curious.

564
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,210
约翰  很高兴又见面了
John, it's good to see you again.

565
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,750
和我说说  是不是和你老板闹掰了
So tell me, did you fall out with your boss?

566
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,020
你在寻求活儿吗
Are you looking for a job?

567
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,590
我在寻求帮助
I'm looking for help.

568
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,880
我的帮助吗
From me?

569
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,720
我凭什么要帮你
Why would I help you?

570
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,620
我救过你一命
I saved your life.

571
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,800
确实  你救过
You did, didn't you?

572
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,270
但你也破坏了我计划好的
But you also broke up a little family reunion

573
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,520
家庭小聚
that I had planned.

574
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,030
是你做的  不是吗
That was you, wasn't it?

575
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,950
坦诚错误
Honest to a fault.

576
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,140
是什么事
What's this about?

577
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,420
有人绑架了一个孩子
Someone kidnapped a child,

578
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,090
杀害了她的母亲
murdered her mother.

579
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,240
就像莫雷蒂杀害了你的母亲
Just like Moretti murdered your mother,

580
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,030
夺走了你的童年
stole your childhood.

581
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,000
-我活了下来  -这个孩子不会
- I survived. - This child won't.

582
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,560
她只有六个月大
She's six months old,

583
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,340
一名婴儿
a baby.

584
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,220
我知道你想掌管这个城市
I know you're aiming to take over this city,

585
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,510
但要想控制它  你需要规则
but to control it, you need rules.

586
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,910
人们开始对孩子下手
People start targeting children,

587
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,840
规则就不复存在
there are no rules.

588
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,060
没人有好处
No winners.

589
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,580
谁是绑架案的幕后黑手
Who's behind the kidnapping?

590
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,490
东欧人
Eastern Europeans.

591
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,250
有人雇他们把这个孩子运出国去
They've been paid to get the baby out of the country.

592
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,980
他们今晚就要动手了
And they're moving her tonight.

593
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,220
他们的运输范围不包括新泽西南部
Their remit doesn't extend south of Jersey.

594
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
他们会把孩子交给墨西哥人
They'll hand it off to the Mexicans.

595
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,210
那些才是人口贩子
They're the people smugglers.

596
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,360
像是这样的转手交易
A hand-off like that --

597
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,980
你一定可以找出交易地点
you can find out where it's happening,

598
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,430
把我带过去
and you can get me there.

599
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,770
交易在卡姆登路1637号
Hand-over's at 1637 Camden.

600
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,140
你也许能赶上
You might get there in time.

601
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,340
我本来应该一枪崩了你
