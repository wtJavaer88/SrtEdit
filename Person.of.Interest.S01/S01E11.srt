14
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,050
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

15
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,120
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

16
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,990
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

17
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,940
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know, because I built it.

18
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,990
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

19
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,000
但它却看到了一切
But it sees everything...

20
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,200
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

21
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,280
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,340
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

23
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,770
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

24
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,370
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

25
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,970
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

26
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

27
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,020
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

28
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,580
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

29
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,330
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
If your number's up, we'll find you.

30
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,970
发现里瑟了  关闭摄像机
Got eyes on Reese. Kill the cameras.

31
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,580
该回家了  约翰  以前的事就让它过去吧
Time to come home, John. Slate's been wiped clean.

32
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,920
你知道这是不可能的
You know that'll never happen.

33
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,770
今晚第三个了  看来是满月啊
Third one tonight. Must be a full moon.

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,980
你叫法鲁克・马达你
Your name is Farouk Madani.

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,790
你是纳贾夫[伊拉克城市]最好的大夫
You were the best surgeon in Najaf,

36
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,360
但你却没钱申请美国的医师资格证
But you can't afford a license in the States

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,190
因为你的钱都寄回家了
because you send all your money home to family.

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,530
帮他缝合  别问问题
Stitch him up-- no questions asked--

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,420
你就能重新做医生了
and you can be a doctor again.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,420
警察  所有人都下来
Police. Everybody out.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,940
纽约警局  都下车
NYPD! Come out of there!

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,810
有什么问题吗  警探
Yhere a problem, detective?

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,390
你们盯梢基地组织时也这么毛糙吗
Are you guys this sloppy when you tail al-qaeda?

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,540
这地方不错  出来散步吗
Cute place. You gonna be out for a while?

45
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,110
对了  你们不毛糙
Right, this isn't you being sloppy at all.

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,190
你这是在示威
This is you making a point.

47
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,400
据我们所知  你是唯一一个和他
You're the only person we know of who's had any contact

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,950
-有联系的人  -如果我有他的消息
- with our boy. - If I hear from him,

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,680
一定立刻告诉你们  但这一套
you'll be the first to know, but all this?

50
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,840
-没必要  -是吗
- Unnecessary. - Is it?

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,510
我真惊讶他居然能逃脱
You know, I was really surprised he was able to slip away.

52
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,650
真搞不明白他怎么做到
Just can't figure out how he did it.

53
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,160
这已经不是我的案子了  你慢慢玩吧
It's not my case anymore, so you have fun with that.

54
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,520
我和你一样不喜欢这样  卡特
I don't like this any more than you do, Carter.

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,540
昼夜不停地盯梢
Watching someone night and day,

56
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,710
你不知道会有什么发现
you never know what you'll dig up.

57
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,630
我见过有人就这么失去了工作和家人
I've seen it ruin careers, families.

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,520
威胁警察是犯法的  斯诺先生
Threatening a police officer is against the law, Mr. Snow.

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,780
对联邦探员撒谎也是
So is lying to a federal agent.

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,310
我会盯着你
I'll be seeing you.

61
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,970
好吧  你会把密码放在...
Okay, where would you keep...

62
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,190
这人是他的同伙
This guy's his partner, and it turns out

63
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,270
现在发现其实我有他的手机号码
I've had his cell phone number for weeks now.

64
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,480
你所拨打的号码不在服务区
The number you have reached is not in service.

65
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,930
你要是用我的电脑  干脆帮我把报告写了
You're gonna use my computer, you gotta do my reports too.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,450
你好  我是纽约警局的卡特警探
Hi, detective Carter, NYPD.

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,340
我要你给我所有这个
I need all the locations data you've got

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,750
接不通的手机的定位信息
on a disconnected cell phone.

69
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,860
是在诺曼・伯戴特名下
Yeah, name's "Burdett, norman."

70
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,200
917-555-0131

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,840
这人是谁
So who's this guy?

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,120
我就是在查
That's what I'm trying to find out.

73
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,270
我还以为只有你们老板才会这种排场
I thought these folks were just for your boss.

74
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,100
抱歉要用这种地下党的方式接头
Sorry about all the cloak-and-dagger.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,990
什么风把你从首都吹来了
So what brings you up from D.C.?

76
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,020
你
You.

77
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,390
-我真是受宠若惊  艾丽夏  -别
- I'm flattered, Alicia. - Don't be.

78
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,150
我的人要你给个说法
My people want answers.

79
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,570
国安局为你们公司提供监视录像三年了
Your company has had the N.S.A. feeds for three years.

80
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,750
不是我们公司  只是我而已
Not my company, just me.

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,830
要是国会知道了你在造的这台机器
If congress knew about this machine you're building,

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,260
还有我们给你的无限制权限
about the unfettered access we've given you

83
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,150
让你接触到我们美国公民的资料
to all the data we're compiling on U.S. Citizens,

84
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,570
不会只是关门而已  你会去坐牢
You wouldn't just be shut down. You would go to jail.

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,010
估计不会让我俩同监室吧
I don't suppose they'd let us be cell mates.

86
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,420
你得汇报进展  奈森  否则我们就撤出
We need progress, Nathan, or we're pulling the plug.

87
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,360
-这是什么  -这就是进展
- What's this? - It's progress.

88
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,670
-只有九位数字吗  -你是做情报工作的
- Nine digits? - You work in intelligence.

89
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,770
自己破解吧
Figure it out.

90
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,790
我真想有那么一次让你来处理这种事
For once, I'd like you to handle one of these meetings

91
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,080
而我躲在暗处
while I lurk in the shadows.

92
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,470
你试试看就知道不可能了
You couldn't lurk if you tried.

93
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,240
我们给她的那个号码  最好能成功
That number we gave her... it better pan out.

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,390
会的
It will.

95
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,870
你怎么知道
How?

96
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,750
我不知道  但是机器知道
I don't know. But the machine does.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,020
-有点信心啊  奈森  -对你还是机器
- Have a little faith, Nathan. - In you or in the machine?

98
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,540
好  海耶斯先生  就是这里了
Okay, Mr. Hayes, this is the place.

99
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,450
当心脚下
Watch your step--uh...

100
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,210
不是说你的脚  这只是
Not your step, I mean-- it's just one of those things

101
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,290
一个惯用说法  无意冒犯
people say, you know? No--no offense.

102
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,420
我们这里有轮椅通道  如果有什么需要
But we got ramps all over the place, so if you need anything--

103
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,730
我几天后就能站起来了
I'll be on my feet in a few days.

104
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,760
好  有什么问题就给我电话
Yeah, but if anything goes wrong, you call me.

105
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,300
我是管理员  我叫柴斯克
I'm the super. Name is Trask.

106
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,590
-我跟你说过了吗  -两次了
- I tell you that already? - Twice.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,620
看来我是老了
I guess I'm getting old.

108
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,030
想当年我通宵在迈阿密派对狂欢
It seems like yesterday I was partying till dawn

109
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,280
仿佛就在昨天啊
down in miami.

110
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,480
我以前在那里有六家夜店
Used to own six nightclubs down there.

111
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,370
以前我在科勒尔盖布尔斯有栋豪宅
You know, I had a mansion in Coral Gables,

112
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,290
一只白色孟加拉虎  不得不放弃这一切
a white bengal tiger... had to give all that up.

113
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,540
对我健康不好  你呢
Bad for my health. What about you?

114
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,350
你是哪儿人  干什么的
Where you from? What do you do?

115
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,720
怎么坐上轮椅了
How'd you wind up in that chair?

116
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,470
我晚上不太顺
I had a rough night.

117
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,890
好吧
Okay.

118
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,710
给你钥匙  有什么需要
Here are the keys. You need anything,

119
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,560
就拨租约上我的号码
my number's on that lease.

120
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,080
我的名字是  你知道了
The name is-- well, you know.

121
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,280
一切满意吗  里瑟先生
Everything satisfactory, Mr. Reese?

122
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,530
好地方
Nice place.

123
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,750
不过真是劳您费神了
You really shouldn't have gone to this much trouble, though.

124
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,370
不麻烦  我想你已经受够了宾馆了
No trouble--I thought you'd get tired of hotels,

125
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,990
另外照你的情况看  我感觉
and, in your condition, I felt that something a bit more

126
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,950
你还是低调些好
low-profile was in order.

127
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,290
我们的好伙伴斯诺呢
Where's our pal snow?

128
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,090
眼下正忙着盯着卡特警探
Preoccupied with detective Carter at the moment.

129
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,690
她还好么
She all right?

130
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,190
不是我不关心这个女人
Not that I don't share your concern for the woman

131
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,020
但她想把你交给中情局
who tried to hand you over to the CIA--

132
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,870
她放我们走了  只是
She did let us go. Just...

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,340
在我休养的这段时间里
Keep an eye on her for me for a while,

134
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,690
帮我留意她一下
while I'm resting up.

135
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,280
这个嘛
About that...

136
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,990
我不是来这休息的是吧
I'm not here to rest, am I?

137
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,750
机器不等人啊
I'm afraid the machine waits for no man.

138
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,270
下一个号码是谁
So who's the next number on your list?

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,090
-你刚见过他  -那个管理员吗
- You just met him. - The super?

140
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,230
詹姆斯先生  给你换过淋浴喷头了
Mr. James, got that shower head for you.

141
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,280
-多谢  -你好吗  帕克夫人
- Thanks. - How you doing, mrs. Park?

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,370
我很好  多谢
Oh, fine, thanks.

143
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,250
少打些电话  艾伦  会辐射大脑
Ease up on the phone, Aaron. It'll nuke your brain.

144
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,150
好吧  谢谢  欧尼
Yeah, thanks, Ernie.

145
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,310
大厨莉莉  真是美女

146
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,360
谢谢  欧尼  你自己写的诗吗
Thanks, ernie. You write that one yourself?

147
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,930
欧尼斯特・P・柴斯克  51岁
Ernest p. Trask, 51 years old.

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,520
生于佛罗里达的古德兰  人口394
Born in Goodland, Florida, population 394.

149
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,340
小镇子在数码资料存储方面
Small towns aren't exactly paragons

150
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,580
可不是什么先进模范
Of digital record-keeping, but I did verify

151
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,840
不过我查到他有高中毕业证书
he got a high school diploma.

152
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,460
我猜猜 没有什么夜店  豪宅
Let me guess. No nightclubs, no mansions,

153
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,500
还有什么宠物老虎
No pet tigers?

154
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,260
看来柴斯克先生想象力丰富
Mr. Trask seems to have a vivid imagination.

155
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,960
你就没什么东西要收拾么
Don't you have anything to unpack?

156
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,140
轻装简行
I travel light.

157
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,590
-知道谁是威胁吗  -暂时不知道
- Any idea what the threat is? - Not yet.

158
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,400
他当了14年管理员了
He's been super for 14 years.

159
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,900
工作生活在同一个地方
Lives and works in the same place.

160
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,160
所以不管柴斯克身上要发生什么事
So whatever's gonna happen with Trask,

161
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,040
多半会发生在这里
it will probably happen here.

162
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,080
这栋楼里有多少人
How many people in the building?

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,290
-241个  -那就是241个嫌犯咯
- 241. - so 241 suspects?

164
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,220
也许只有一个
Or maybe just one.

165
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,830
我擅自黑入了柴斯克的在线电话账单
I took the liberty of hacking into Trask's online phone bill

166
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,460
他上周给三家典当行打了电话
He called three pawn shops last week,

167
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,970
那种店铺专门贩卖不经登记
The kind that specialize in off-the-books sales

168
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,570
难以追查的手枪
of untraceable handguns.

169
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,510
柴斯克可能计划要杀死某个人
Trask might be planning to kill somebody.

170
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,020
-你没给我带一杯吗  -无功不能受禄
- You didn't get me anything? - Coffee's for closers.

171
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,700
我给你射杀里瑟的大好机会  你失手了
I got you a clear shot at Reese and you whiffed.

172
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,070
我的目的不是杀死他  是你说
I wasn't aiming to kill. You said you wanted

173
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,840
你想问他在鄂尔多斯发生了什么
to question him about what happened in Ordos.

174
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,920
我是说"有可能的话"
If possible.

175
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,240
那是次要目的
Secondary objective.

176
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,120
她在干什么
What's she up to?

177
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,840
据我们所见  在赶一些文件工作
Near as we can tell? Catching up on paperwork.

178
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,170
她没有用她的电脑或手机
She's not using her computer or phones.

179
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,030
里瑟呢
Reese?

180
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,460
我们安排人查了300英里半径内
We got people checking every hospital, clinic,

181
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,400
所有医院  诊所  停尸房
and morgue in a 300-mile radius.

182
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,680
只要有人救他  我们就能查到
If anybody stitched him up, we'll pick up the scent.

183
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,140
希望你不介意
I hope you don't mind

184
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,430
我除了必要的硬件之外
but in addition to the necessary hardware

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,380
还买了些书给你读
I brought a few books for you to read...

186
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,060
还有一点乔迁贺礼
and a little housewarming gift.

187
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,050
-多谢了  -想试试吗
- Thanks. - You want to try it out?

188
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,070
不用了  我现在挺好
No. I'm--I'm good for now.

189
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,370
你以后会感谢我
You'll thank me later.

190
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,190
柴斯克似乎是个无伤大雅的牛皮大王
You know, Trask may seem like a harmless bag of wind,

191
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,700
不过我之前也上过当
but I've been fooled before.

192
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,060
既然他买了枪  我想知道为什么
If he bought a gun, I'd just like to know why.

193
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,670
只有一个办法能查出来
Only one way to find out.

194
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,930
黑入他的无线网络吗
We're going to hack his wi-fi?

195
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,270
黑入所有的无线网络
We're gonna hack all of them.

196
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,190
如果威胁来自这栋楼
If the threat's in the building,

197
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,610
我们就得认识一下邻居们
we should get to know our neighbors.

198
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,790
你已经进入16个网络了吗
You're into 16 networks already?

199
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,500
电讯公司提供无线网络服务时
When the phone company puts in your wi-fi,

200
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,460
初始密码就是手机号码
the password is your phone number.

201
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,880
大部分人根本不会改
Most people never even change it.

202
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,010
就算是改了的也不难搞定
The other ones might actually take a minute.

203
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,230
我们一黑入  就打开所有的网络摄像头
Once we're in, we can turn every webcam,

204
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,750
保姆监视器  安全系统  手提电脑网络
nanny cam, security system, and laptop on the network

205
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,420
变成了我们的耳目
into our eyes and ears.

206
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,260
就像那台机器一样
Just like the machine.

207
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,130
把一栋公寓楼想象成整个世界  算是吧
I suppose...if one apartment building were the entire world.

208
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,150
厨师莉莉似乎在和公寓顶层的瑞克约会
Lily the Cook seems to be dating Rick from the penthouse

209
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,540
而714房间的安珀
And Amber in 714 is...

210
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,810
真健康
Healthy.

211
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,090
我有些怀疑到底是什么触动了机器
Somehow I doubt that's what alerted the machine.

212
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,300
有发现了  芬奇
Got one, Finch.

213
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,070
道格・斯坦利  保安人员
Doug Stanley, security guard.

214
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,080
他正在追捕一名从女子公寓
He's been hunting a thief who's been stealing jewelry

215
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,450
偷走珠宝的小偷
out of women's apartments.

216
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,720
也许柴斯克就是那个小偷  想要杀死道格
Maybe Trask is the thief planning to kill Doug,

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,950
以掩盖其罪行
to cover his crimes.

218
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,630
又或者柴斯克知道谁是小偷
Or Trask knows who the thief is

219
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,150
所以小偷计划杀了他
and now they're planning to kill him.

220
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,740
那是房东  阿兰・霍特
That's the landlord, Alan Holt.

221
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,930
柴斯克看起来可不像明星雇员
Doesn't look like Trask is the employee of the month.

222
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,550
也许他打算扭断老板的脖子
Maybe he's about to snap and kill his boss?

223
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,040
为什么机器要给出他的社保号码
Why did the machine give us his number?

224
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,660
柴斯克有麻烦了
Is Trask in trouble...

225
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,820
还是他就是麻烦
Or is he the problem?

226
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,290
傻盯着墙是得不出答案的
Well, you're not gonna get it staring at the wall.

227
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,920
得出去搜集点情报
We need to do some legwork.

228
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,670
好吧
Right.

229
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,090
我就位了  麻烦快点
I'm in position. Make it quick, please.

230
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,350
柴斯克先生  我是521的约翰・海耶斯
Mr. Trask, it's John Hayes in 521.

231
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,470
-我这边出了点问题  -我马上到
- I'm having a bit of a problem. - I'll be right there.

232
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,940
该死  该死  该死
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

233
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,240
我安装好摄像头了  里瑟先生
I've planted the cameras, Mr. Reese.

234
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,560
现在开始搜查
I'm starting to search.

235
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,460
自从奥珀尔飓风袭击了我的游艇后
I haven't seen damage like this since hurricane Opal

236
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,520
我就再没见过这么严重的情况了
trashed my yacht.

237
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,520
1995年发生在阿拉巴马州的超级飓风

238
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,070
简直就像有人用锤子敲了似的
Looks like somebody went at this with a hammer.

239
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,650
没发现枪
No sign of a gun.

240
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,410
但我可不信他只是在收集子弹
But I doubt if he's just a collector of bullets.

241
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,930
那么他到底想杀谁
So who does he want to shoot?

242
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,480
果然  带的工具又错了
Of course, I didn't bring the right one.

243
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,730
我去去就来
I'll be right back.

244
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,420
柴斯克需要管扳钳  芬奇
Trask needs a pipe wrench, Finch.

245
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,780
-他下去了  -好了  马上
- He's coming back down. - Okay, just a minute.

246
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,500
芬奇  他在院子里  朝你过来了
Finch, he's in the courtyard headed your way.

247
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,980
走路要带眼睛  柴斯克
Watch where you're going, Trask.

248
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,780
芬奇
Finch.

249
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,860
他为她痴狂了
He's obsessed with her.

250
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,870
看来我们不是唯一在
I'm afraid we're not the only ones

251
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,630
监视邻居的人  里瑟先生
spying on our neighbors, Mr. Reese.

252
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,300
哈罗德  快出去
Harold, get out of there now.

253
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,130
芬奇  你出去了吗
Finch, did you get out of there?

254
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,430
芬奇
Finch?

255
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,030
你是什么...
Who the hell--

256
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,100
回来
Hey! Come here!

257
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,540
你在我家干什么
What were you doing in my place?

258
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,580
帮我一把
I could use a hand here.

259
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,360
好  坚持住  坚持住
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

260
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,230
他要关闭电梯
Okay, he's gonna kill the elevator.

261
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,560
保安  我是柴斯克
Security, this is Trask.

262
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,000
芬奇  他在西边的楼梯井
Finch, he's in the west stairwell.

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,860
右拐  从西边上去
Turn right, take the east stairs up

264
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,260
过三层  你就到家了
Three flights and you're home.

265
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,880
不过要快  他40秒后就到你这层了
But move quick, he'll be on your floor in about 40 seconds.

266
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,790
我感觉就像迷宫里的老鼠
I feel like a rat in a maze.

267
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,290
你是怎么应付这些的
How do you put up with this?

268
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,660
道格  我刚刚撞到一个入侵者
Doug, I just caught a guy breaking in.

269
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,260
他就在我公寓里
He was just in my apartment.

270
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,760
继续走  芬奇  你不会有事的
Keep walking, Finch. You'll be fine.

271
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,400
身高175  带眼镜  有点瘸
5'9", glasses. He walks with a limp.

272
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,870
我猜他可能就是你在找的小偷
I think he might be that thief you've been looking for.

273
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
这保安在那间公寓干什么呢
What was that security guard doing in that apartment?

274
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,870
芬奇
Finch...

275
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,560
我肯定道格知道你不是小偷
I'm pretty sure Doug knows you're not the thief.

276
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,110
他才是
He is.

277
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,870
我把证据发给你
And I'm sending you the proof.

278
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,170
-手机不错  -给你看样东西
- Nice phone. - Can I show you something?

279
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,480
道格  他在不在  你看到他了吗
Doug, is he up there? Have you found him yet?

280
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,970
我们可以报警
So we can call the police...

281
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,820
或者你忘了见过我  我也忘了见过你
Or you can forget you saw me, and I'll forget I saw you.

282
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,980
我要去查下一层
I'm gonna check the next floor.

283
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,030
他不在第二层
He's not on two.

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,810
柴斯克有武器  对莉莉怀有危险的狂热
So Trask is armed, has a dangerous fixation on Lily,

285
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,580
刚刚还追了我三层楼
and he just chased me up three floors.

286
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,560
可以蛮有把握地说  他就是凶手了
Safe to say he's our perpetrator.

287
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,490
我不确定  芬奇  你真的不想去
I don't know, Finch. Sure you don't want to

288
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,870
复核一下你的机器吗
double-check with your machine?

289
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,430
你要不要每次都说这个笑话啊
Yes, that joke never gets old.

290
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,930
哈罗德  没事吧
Harold, is everything okay?

291
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,020
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

292
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,820
有人来了
We have company.

293
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,650
抱歉我们不请自来了  奈特
Sorry to pop up unannounced, Nate.

294
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,280
我们总该不是喝多了要闲扯吧
I guess we're not doing this over drinks.

295
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,830
他在这儿工作
He works here.

296
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,870
就算是我  偶尔也需要技术支持
Even I need technical support sometimes.

297
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,600
奈森  你还记得威克斯副局长吧
Nathan, you remember deputy director Weeks.

298
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,760
大权在握的人  希望我没惹上什么麻烦
The man in charge. I hope I'm not in trouble.

299
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,970
你给我们的那9个数字是个社保号码
The nine digits you gave us are the social security number

300
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,690
是戈登・科兹威尔的  他是我们的人  
of a man named Gordon Kurzweil. He's one of ours.

301
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,820
他是国防情报局官员  身份绝密
He's a D.I.A. case officer. Top secret clearance.

302
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,690
藏身联调局二十年了
Been acing F.B.I. background checks for 20 years.

303
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,890
我们监视了科兹威尔两个星期  一无所获
We surveilled Kurzweil for two weeks, got nothing.

304
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,110
就在我们以为是你耍花招
And just when we were thinking that you'd sold us

305
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,700
糊弄我们的时候  他行动了
a bill of goods, he breaks pattern.

306
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,850
动作还不小
goes for a drive.

307
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,640
一位叙利亚商人在贝塞斯达一个公园落了部手机
At a park in Bethesda, a Syrian businessman drops his phone.

308
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
美国马里兰州中部城市

309
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,550
库兹韦尔捡到它  通过加密的短信
Kurzweil picks it up, and via coded S.M.S.，

310
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,700
他安排了一比交易
he arranges to sell 26 pounds of

311
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,250
向伊朗政府出售26吨的武器级铀
weapons-grade uranium to the Iranian government.

312
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,250
超过最低标准的武器级的核武器器材用料

313
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,480
看来号码确实起作用了
So I guess the number panned out?

314
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,080
我要你解释给我听
What I need you to explain to me is...

315
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,710
为什么联邦特工都不能发现的叛徒
How did some damn computer program spot a traitor

316
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,740
某台天煞的电脑却能发现
when federal agents couldn't?

317
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,290
其实  我也不知道
Honestly? Not a clue.

318
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,170
机器能及时提供行动情报
The machine will deliver actionable intelligence

319
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,050
以阻止任何危及国家安全的威胁
in time to thwart any threat to national security.

320
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,840
但它的操作系统是个黑匣子
But its operating system is a black box.

321
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,900
如果我们想用这台机器锁定特定目标呢
And if we want to direct this machine at a specific target?

322
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,890
没这个必要
No need.

323
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,100
它监视着每个目标
It already watches every target.

324
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,580
你这对我们的要求可有点高啊  奈森
You're asking us to take a lot on faith here, Nathan.

325
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,290
一个我们不能检查
A piece of software we can't inspect,

326
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,050
不能控制  也不能更改的软件
can't control or modify

327
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,590
只有靠它的感觉为我们提供情报吗
that only feeds us Intel when it feels like it?

328
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,460
它能觉察到威胁
When it perceives a threat.

329
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,800
我很抱歉  伙计们  但这是我们保护
Look, I'm sorry, folks, but it's the only way

330
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,100
它和我们自己的唯一方法
that we can keep it and us protected.

331
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,460
如果没人看见机器监测到的东西
If no human sees what the machine sees,

332
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,500
那理论上来讲
then technically,

333
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,770
没人的第四修正案权利[指隐私权]被侵犯
no one's fourth amendment rights have been violated.

334
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,880
英格拉姆先生  你何不就关心自己的公司
Why don't you just focus on your computer, Mr. Ingram,

335
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,780
而把违反宪法权利的问题留给我们
and leave the constitutional concerns to us?

336
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,980
因为我也是名美国公民
Because I'm a citizen too, and I'm a lot more comfortable

337
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,210
而且让机器监视我的一举一动这种事
having this machine watch my every move

338
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,000
我亲自来做比让你们做更舒坦
than someone like you.

339
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,390
所以它一直是个封闭系统
So it will remain a closed system,

340
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,460
完全独立
fully autonomous?

341
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,490
而我们知道的只是一个号码
All we get is a number?

342
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,690
一个号码不是足够让你抓到科兹威尔了吗
Did you need more than a number to pick up Kurzweil?

343
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,630
这台机器提醒你留意某个人  而你照做了
The software told you to take a closer look, so you did.

344
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,430
它是个黑匣子
It's a black box.

345
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,060
就是这样  接不接受随你便
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

346
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,410
我不习惯被个合同承包人指手画脚
I'm not accustomed to having contractors dictate terms.

347
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,760
如果你提供的是有缺陷的软件
If you're going to be supplying crippled software,

348
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,200
那我们可能需要重新商议价钱
maybe we need to revisit the question of price.

349
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,920
不如你来告诉他商议好的价钱吧  艾丽夏
Why don't you tell him the price negotiated, Alicia?

350
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,490
英格拉姆先生认为这个项目
Mr. Ingram felt that this project was his duty

351
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,100
是他作为公民而非商人的责任
as a citizen, not a businessman.

352
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,470
他造了机器  却只要一美金的回报
He's building the machine for one U.S. Dollar.

353
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,800
我猜我别无选择了
I suppose I don't have a choice.

354
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
我就知道
I know, I know.

355
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,450
我不知道自己还能做些什么
I don't know what to do anymore.

356
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,670
除了拒绝我还能说些什么  他一直都在
How else to say no. He's always right there.

357
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,120
即使我看不见他  我感觉得到他在监视我
Even when I can't see him, I can feel his eyes on me.

358
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,580
是把撞匙
It's a bump key.

359
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,770
就像硬件黑客
A hardware hack.

360
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,750
插进去  转一下  再震一下
Just stick it in, twist, give it a little jolt...

361
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,100
它就能打开这栋楼的所有锁
And it'll open any lock in the building.

362
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,640
你不会再被人逮到了  放心
You won't be caught with nowhere to run again.

363
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,790
那个柴斯克你迷恋的女人
And this is everything you've found on the woman

364
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,100
这是你查到的所有资料吗
that Trask is obsessed with?

365
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,090
莉莉・桑顿  在佐治亚州长大
Lily Thornton. Grew up in Georgia,

366
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,400
在她爸爸的餐馆里做厨师
cooking in her dad's diner.

367
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,220
一流厨师  05年毕业
Cordon bleu, class of 05.

368
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,120
09年前一直住在她阿姨家
Staying in her great aunt's apartment since 09.

369
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,720
现在是曼哈顿一家顶级餐厅燃起的新星
And currently a rising star at a top Manhattan bistro.

370
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,490
在同瑞克・莫里斯交往
Romantically linked to Rick Morris,

371
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,400
一名有势力的餐厅老板
A powerful restaurateur.

372
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,540
干得不错  里瑟先生
This is very nice work, Mr. Reese.

373
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,840
我以前也用过电脑
Well, I have used a computer before.

374
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,530
但我们看不到她房间的录像
But we can't get video from her place.

375
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,240
她每天都会改无线上网密码
She changes her wi-fi password every day.

376
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,810
随机字母和数字
Random alphanumerics.

377
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,390
你会喜欢有安全意识的女孩
You gotta love a girl with good security habits.

378
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,120
所以柴斯克一直在偷拍她
So Trask has been snapping pictures of her.

379
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,370
我们能肯定这说明他要杀她吗
Are we sure that means he wants to kill her?

380
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,380
76%的女性被害人在被杀前
76% of all female homicide victims are stalked

381
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,590
都被跟踪过
before they're murdered.

382
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,900
我会盯着她
Well, I better keep an eye on her then.

383
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,350
你不是要跟着她去上班吧
You're not tailing her to work?

384
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,620
这玩意我已经用上手了
I'm getting pretty good at this thing.

385
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,770
是啊  而我肯定中情局打死你的时候
Yes, I'm sure the C.I.A. will be deeply impressed

386
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,870
可会相当佩服你呢
when they shoot you.

387
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,400
我坐不住了  芬奇
Just feeling a little restless here, Finch.

388
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,640
用那个坐垫啊
Use the cushion.

389
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,790
号码是不等人的  芬奇
The numbers never stop coming in, Finch.

390
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,790
要是在我行动不便的时候
What are we gonna do if another one comes in

391
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,050
出现另一个号码怎么办
while I'm sidelined?

392
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,470
我肯定我会有办法
I'm sure I'd think of something.

393
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,050
我知道你不带枪
And I know you won't carry a gun,

394
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,550
但如果我要你外出行动
but if I'm sending you back in the field,

395
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,810
你一定要带点能自卫的东西
you're getting some basic self-defense.

396
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,620
-我真觉得没有...  -不  听着
- Oh, I really don't think-- - No, listen up.

397
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,880
如果柴斯克攻击你  你就用手指
If Trask comes at you, put your fingers straight out

398
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,710
这么往他的眼睛里插
like this and strike at his eyes.

399
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,170
戳他眼睛  这就是你所谓的技巧吗
Poke him in the eyes? That's your technique?

400
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,680
不  那是你要学的技巧  如果那没用
No, that's your technique, and if that doesn't work,

401
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,900
你就用大拇指  挤他眼窝
you can always take your thumb, jam it in his eye socket,

402
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,050
不停地转  直到你打中他的头
and twist till you hit his brain.

403
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,690
别说了
Please, stop.

404
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,250
柴斯克还在院子里
Trask is still in the courtyard,

405
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,920
但莉莉工作的时候得有人看着
But I want eyes on Lily at work.

406
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,830
我马上就去
I'll be with her shortly.

407
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,690
如果柴斯克想要杀她
If she is Trask's intended victim,

408
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,220
那我最好能看到她房间里面
I'd like a better view of the inside of her apartment

409
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,640
而不是只透过窗户偷窥
instead of simply peering at her through a window.

410
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,130
里瑟先生  她家里已经个摄像头了
Mr. Reese, there's already a camera here.

411
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,580
无线的基本款
Basic consumer model. Wireless.

412
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,390
连至一个隐藏的网络
Streaming to a hidden network.

413
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,590
配对的接收器
The receiver it's paired with

414
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,870
可能在这栋房子的任何地方
could be anywhere in the building.

415
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,160
看来柴斯克监视着她的一举一动
I think Trask has been watching her every move.

416
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,220
我想莉莉已经被监视得够多了
And I think Lily's been spied on enough.

417
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,170
手机定位数据
Cell phone location data.

418
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,710
你这是去哪
Hey, where you going?

419
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
把自己搞晕了
To get lost.

420
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,380
擦干净了要提取指纹
Need to dust this for prints.

421
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,530
-给你  -你把它弄坏了
- There you go. - I think you broke it!

422
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,290
不会看说明书吗
So? Read a book.

423
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,060
先生  我是纽约警察  现在要借你的外套
Sir? NYPD police. I need your jacket now.

424
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,460
你要征用我的外套吗
You're requisitioning my jacket?

425
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,230
出租车
Taxi!

426
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,090
去皇后区  45街和21街的交叉口
Queens, corner of 45th and 21st.

427
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,630
你们有麻烦了
Hey, you guys got a real problem.

428
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,580
卡特查到了你们的一个手机
Carter's got info from one of your cell phones.

429
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,460
她在追查你
She's tracking you.

430
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,210
我知道她在找我
I'm aware that she's looking for me.

431
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,550
我想你也不知道为什么
I don't suppose you know why.

432
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,390
还不明白  我们那位朋友还好吗
No, not yet. How's our guy?

433
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,130
还活着  躲起来了
Alive. Hidden.

434
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,080
你收到我寄去的包裹吗
Did you receive the package I sent?

435
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,180
在我手上呢
Yeah, I got it right here.

436
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,010
怎么  安非他明吃完了吗
What, did you run out of adderall?

437
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,290
上面有我们那位朋友的指纹
Our friend's prints are on it.

438
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,870
我要你帮个忙  让他摆脱中情局的追踪
I need you to throw the C.I.A. off his trail.

439
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,650
来次公路旅行吧  警探
Take a road trip, detective.

440
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,120
康涅狄格这时最美了
Connecticut's nice this time of year.

441
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,710
-菜还合胃口吗  -好吃极了  谢谢
- Is everything good? - It's great. Thank you.

442
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,830
-你们确定...  -下午好  芬奇先生
- You make sure you try... - Good afternoon, Mr. Finch.

443
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,200
莉莉那边怎么样了
How's it going with Lily?

444
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,450
这也许是有史以来最有口福的监视行动
This may be the best-catered stakeout in history.

445
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,130
芬奇  别在那吃东西
Don't eat in the field, Finch.

446
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,760
你不知道何时要行动
Never know when you'll have to move fast.

447
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,460
房东的邮件查出什么了吗
Any progress on the landlord's email?

448
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,570
还在查
Still working on that one.

449
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,610
我在莉莉家找到的摄像头呢
What about the camera I found at Lily's?

450
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,820
如果我们能证明那是柴斯克的
If we can trace it to Trask,

451
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,780
他就会被解雇
we can get him fired,

452
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,000
甚至可能被捕
maybe even arrested.

453
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,220
我还在尝试破解隐藏的无线网络
Still trying to break into the hidden wireless network.

454
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,580
密码还没破解出来
No luck cracking the password yet.

455
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,180
但我找到了些其他信息
But I did find out some information

456
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,520
关于我们那位朋友柴斯克
About our friend Trask.

457
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,040
原来他曾经有过一个老婆
Turns out there used to be a Mrs. Trask.

458
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,180
-曾经  -她十三年前人间蒸发了
- Used to? - she disappeared 13 years ago.

459
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,190
柴斯克从没报过警
Trask never called the cops.

460
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,570
跟别人说她去波卡拉顿和家人住了
Told everyone she went to be with family in Boca Raton.

461
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,860
那我猜她肯定没去
And I'm guessing she's not in boca.

462
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,440
在我看来
Far as I can tell...

463
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,120
她哪都没去
She's not anywhere.

464
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,220
或许莉莉不是他的第一个被害人
Maybe Lily's not his first.

465
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,870
我的天
Oh, my god.

466
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,880
我可以肯定她知道自己有个跟踪狂
And I think it's safe to say she knows she has a stalker.

467
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,810
艾伦
Hey, Aaron?

468
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,250
你能帮我把这些都扔掉么
Can you just throw these away for me?

469
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,830
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

470
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,040
可怜的女娃子真遭罪
Poor girl seems miserable.

471
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,990
她刚把一件礼物扔进垃圾堆
She just threw a gift in the trash.

472
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,460
一捧玫瑰
Bouquet of roses.

473
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,510
出租车
Taxi!

474
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,770
伯戴特  你的最后落脚点是在这里
So, this is where your trail ends, Burdett.

475
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,380
接下来你会去哪
Where'd you go from here?

476
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,450
你这是在浪费时间  警探
You're wasting your time, Detective.

477
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,710
我今早刚刚伪造了地点信息
I falsified the location data this morning.

478
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,690
我敢打赌你的真名肯定不叫伯戴特
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess your name isn't Burdett.

479
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,980
你觉得找到我就能找到我的搭档么
Do you think finding me will lead you to my partner?

480
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,060
你还想继续你的逮捕归案
Are you still trying to make that arrest?

481
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,200
不了  他那些中情局哥们不让我管了
Oh, no. His C.I.A. Pals got that out of my system.

482
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,430
我要的是抓住他  不是杀掉他
I wanted to catch him, not kill him.

483
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,900
那你现在想要什么
What do you want now?

484
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,130
还在想
Still working that out.

485
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,340
但如果我要继续对着政府特工撒谎
But if I'm going to keep lying to government agents

486
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,980
好保护你们俩  我就得有个极好的理由
To protect you two, I'm gonna need a damn good reason.

487
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,590
我要答案
I want answers.

488
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,860
我要知道你们都做的什么
I need to know what you do.

489
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,040
转身  警探
Turn around, Detective.

490
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,690
你朋友怎么样了
How's your friend?

491
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,770
你总得跟我讲清楚
You're gonna have to tell me something.

492
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,880
比如你们都是什么人
Like who the hell are you,

493
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,990
还有现在这算怎么个情况
And what exactly is going on here?

494
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,620
我九岁的时候  我的兄弟们认为
When I was nine years old, my brothers decided

495
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,590
我该去学游泳  于是他们就把我扔进了
I needed to learn swim, so they tossed me

496
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,030
泳池里最深的区域
Into the deep end of the pool.

497
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,670
花了我点时间  但是我总算会游了
Took a few minutes, but I figured it out.

498
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,680
你看见那人了吗  警探
Do you see that man, Detective?

499
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,880
他的名字叫德雷克・华生  39岁
His name is Derek Watson, 39 years old.

500
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,190
18个月之前  他没了工作
18 months ago, he lost his job.

501
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,940
他曾想方设法地供他的按揭
He tried to keep up with the mortgage as best he could,

502
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,980
但最终还是断了炊
But the money ran out eventually.

503
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,480
没了房子  很快又没了老婆
Lost his house, and his wife left soon after.

504
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,090
德雷克・华生将要卷入一起暴力犯罪
Derek Watson is about to be involved in a violent crime.

505
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,270
我不知道具体会是什么  但相信我
I don't know what exactly, but believe me,

506
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,590
很快就会有事发生
Something is gonna happen.

507
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
那种事你不可能知道
You can't know that.

508
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,010
你带了你的勤务枪了吗  警探
Did you bring your service weapon, Detective?

509
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,240
很抱歉就这么把你扔进深水区了
Sorry to toss you into the deep end,

510
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,070
但是  你也知道  我的朋友身体不适
But, as you know, my friend is indisposed.

511
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,500
纽约警局凶杀组
NYPD homicide.

512
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,770
我是卡特
It's Carter.

513
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,190
我要对下述人员做背景调查  德雷克・华生  39岁
I need a background on a Derek Watson, 39 years old.

514
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,140
我查到一个弗农山的德雷克・H・华生
I show a Derek H. Watson in Mount Vernon.

515
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,280
两个月前房屋被提前收回
House was foreclosed two months ago.

516
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,710
没有现住址
No current address.

517
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,180
就是他了  你有什么信息
That's him. What do you got?

518
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,890
没啥  没前科  没逮捕记录
Not much. No priors, no arrests.

519
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,910
有几张违章停车罚单没交
A couple of unpaid parking tickets,

520
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,880
但是就这些
But that's about it.

521
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,140
对了  强制收回他房子的是哪家银行
Hey, what's the name of the bank that took his house?

522
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,030
金鼎信贷
Truprime Mortgage.

523
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,660
银行那边是谁签的文件
Who filed the paperwork for the bank?

524
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,970
约翰・达尔顿  这是一起调查中的谋杀案么
John Dalton. Is this for an open homicide?

525
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,060
我一会儿再跟你说这个
I'll have to get back to you on that.

526
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,740
地球上最强的监侦训练
Finest surveillance training on the planet,

527
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,560
却搞不定一个纽约警察
And a New York cop gave you the slip.

528
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,180
还愣着作甚  难不成她人在这车里
Well, I know she's not in here, guys.

529
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,900
里瑟还没有死  那么就是说
Reese hasn't turned up dead, so odds are

530
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,270
他找到了个安全屋  扩大搜索范围
He's found a safe house. Expand the search.

531
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,190
过去两天里出租的公寓或是酒店房间都要查
All apartments and hotels rented in the last two days.

532
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,860
-但是如果他  -少说话  多办事
 - But if he's anywhere-- - just...make it happen.

533
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,140
你看得到柴斯克么  里瑟先生
You have eyes on Trask, Mr. Reese?

534
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,020
你他喵的上哪去了
Where the hell have you been?

535
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,540
现在你知道我的感受了
Now you know how I feel.

536
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,360
莉莉要回家了  她这样安不安全
Lily's headed home. Is it safe for her there?

537
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,420
我现在正看着柴斯克
I'm watching Trask right now.

538
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,210
而且我也不确定她是不是目标
And I'm not sure she's his target.

539
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,630
我认为柴斯克或许是瞄准了瑞克
I think Trask might be after Rick.

540
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,840
-怎讲  -他花了整个下午
- Why? - Well, he spent the afternoon

541
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,380
在瑞克的房间周围游荡
Sniffing around Rick's apartment.

542
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,750
根据目前掌握的情况  我敢说他在给瑞克挖坟
If I didn't know better, I'd say now he's digging a grave.

543
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,870
柴斯克弄掉那男友
Trask gets rid of the boyfriend

544
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,760
这样就能把莉莉据为己有了
And has Lily all to himself.

545
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,810
一切可好吗
Everything all right?

546
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,780
还行  就是闷得慌
Yeah, I'm just sick of being cooped up

547
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,860
还有屏幕看得眼睛都花了
And, uh, staring at screens all day.

548
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,250
我宁可做这些活  也好过
I'd rather be doing that than trudging around

549
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,580
跑遍半个曼哈顿
Half of Manhattan.

550
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,430
我还分神去查了莉莉的计程车票
I have half a mind to spot Lily cab fare.

551
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,660
芬奇  你最快多久能到
Finch, how fast can you get here?

552
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,490
大概15分钟  怎么了
About 15 minutes. Why?

553
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,630
因为我们没时间了
Because we just ran out of time.

554
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,100
我认为柴斯克今晚就会有行动
I think Trask is making his move tonight.

555
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,130
看邮箱那  莫里斯先生
Checking your mail, huh, Mr. Morris?

556
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,500
-可不是嘛  -我说那啥
- Looks like it. - Yeah, I think I, uh,

557
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,960
我想我知道你家为啥漏水了
I think I figured out why your place is flooding.

558
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,970
就是要一个特制的水龙头
It just, uh, it just needs a special faucet.

559
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,810
我们一起下去看看如何
Why don't we, uh, why don't we go downstairs and check it out?

560
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,230
如果你觉得没问题  我明天就能给你装上
If, uh, if you like it, I can install it tomorrow.

561
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,850
保证再也不漏水  所以我们
No more floods. So why don't we go

562
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,310
-一起去地下室看看呗  -我很忙  好不好
 - Down to the basement? - I-I'm busy, all right?

563
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,650
我没时间看这看那  快点给我弄好就行
I don't need to see anything, just have it fixed.

564
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,130
你得离莉莉远点
You need to stay away from Lily.

565
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,290
说啥
What?

566
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,260
你疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?

567
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,120
我叫了辆车  五分钟就能到
I've called the car. I can be there in five.

568
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,840
那就太迟了
That'll be four minutes too late.

569
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,140
她不爱你  明白吗
She doesn't love you, man. All right?

570
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,490
你必须得离开她
You need to leave her alone.

571
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,650
你丫想老牛吃嫩草想疯了吧  柴斯克
You got some kind of pathetic old-man crush here, Trask?

572
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,980
是不是要干翻我  然后带她出去跳舞啊
Gonna punch me out, take Lily to the dance?

573
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,910
你又不是他男朋友  你更不是她的英雄
You're not her boyfriend, and you're not her hero.

574
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,740
你丫就是个清洁工
You're just the damn janitor.

575
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,040
所以要是我马桶塞了  我会找你的
So if my toilet clogs, I'll let you know.

576
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,560
否则的话  靠边站
Otherwise, step aside.

577
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,600
房子哪里着火了
Is the building on fire?

578
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,950
我保证一切都好  F夫人
I'm sure everything's fine, Mrs. F,

579
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,990
但我马上就去例行检查  好吗
But I'm gonna go check it out just the same, all right?

580
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,410
我回到家发现东西被动了
I come home and things have moved,

581
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,270
就好象他进过我公寓一样
Like he's been inside my apartment.

582
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,150
我很害怕他还会做什么
I'm scared of what he's going to do.

583
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,130
芬奇  这还没完  柴斯克还会再犯
Finch, this isn't over. Trask will try again.

584
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,980
而且他还是很痴迷莉莉
And he's still obsessed with Lily.

585
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,080
也许我们该采取些更激进的手段了
Perhaps we should consider more aggressive tactics.

586
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,080
收到我送你的花了吗
你为什么不给我电话
我们得谈谈
我能看到你

587
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,490
他在恐吓她
He's terrorizing her.

588
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,290
我今晚就要柴斯克滚出这栋公寓
I want Trask out of the building tonight.

589
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,230
-海耶斯先生  -我不叫海耶斯
 - Mr. Hayes. - My name isn't Hayes.

590
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,020
那  我就得请你离开了
Well, then I'm gonna ask you to leave.

591
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,050
事实上
Actually...

592
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,890
你才是那个要走的人
You're the one who'll be leaving.

593
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,770
我不知道你以为你...
Hey, I don't know what you think--

594
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,610
我知道所有事情  那些玫瑰  短信
I know about the roses, and the texts,

595
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,640
- 还有藏起来的摄像头  -不  我绝没有
 - And the hidden camera. - No, I would never--

596
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,260
我知道你有枪  柴斯克  我也知道你想
I know about the gun, Trask, and I know you were ready

597
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,730
今晚就杀掉那个男友
To kill her boyfriend tonight.

598
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,410
他不是她男朋友
He's not her boyfriend.

599
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,750
你不明白
You don't understand.

600
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,700
现在  你必须卷铺盖离开这个地方
Now, you're gonna pack your bag and leave this place.

601
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,950
并且不管你觉得你又多么的爱她
And no matter how much you think you love her,

602
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,270
你永远都不能回这里来
You're never coming back.

603
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,110
拜托
Please...

604
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,920
我热爱这份工作
I love this job.

605
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,600
我也确实在乎莉莉  但不是你想的那样
And I do care for Lily, but not like that.

606
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,900
真的不是
Not like that.

607
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,960
芬奇  柴斯克没有拍那些莉莉的照片
Finch, Trask didn't take those photos of Lily.

608
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,540
他是从顶层公寓偷的
He stole them from the penthouse.

609
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,090
我知道
I know.

610
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,190
他也没有安摄像头
He didn't plant the cameras either.

611
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,870
柴斯克不是尾行的人
Trask isn't the stalker.

612
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,950
你不喜欢那些花吗  宝贝
Didn't you like the flowers, babe?

613
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,840
你怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

614
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,210
我以为今晚就我们二人世界了
I thought it could just be you and me tonight.

615
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,760
求你走吧  请你离开
Please, go. I want you to go.

616
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
来吧  宝贝
Come on, baby.

617
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,360
你知道你其实并不想我走
You know you don't want me to leave.

618
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,830
里瑟先生  我们得靠你帮一把了
Mr. Reese, we're gonna need a little help.

619
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,650
滚出我的公寓
Get out of my apartment now.

620
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,880
你其实并不这样想
You don't mean that.

621
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,450
瑞克  求你  住手吧
Rick, please. This has to stop.

622
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,650
别再来什么电话  什么花了
The phone calls, the flowers--

623
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,780
拜托  那些只是对你我
Come on. Those were just a little

624
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,390
昨晚约会的小小谢意
"Thank you" for our date last night.

625
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,070
那不是约会  我们只是去了同一个派对
That wasn't a date. We were going to the same party.

626
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,460
你这勾人的小妖精
You're such a tease.

627
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,790
你要我跟你乘一辆出租
You made me share a cab with you

628
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,330
然后就跟踪了我一个晚上
and then you followed me all night.

629
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,060
我只是想帮你罢了  心肝儿
I'm just trying to help you, Sweetie.

630
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,980
得了  我能为你做很多事
Come on, I could do so much for you in this town.

631
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,440
我能让你当上总厨
Make you executive chef.

632
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,130
我不想为你工作  我只要你离开
I don't want to work for you, I just want you to leave.

633
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,270
那个管理员让我离你远点
The super told me to stay away from you.

634
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,010
你  是不是跟他说了什么
Did you---- tell him about us?

635
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,450
你是不是撒谎说你不爱我
Did you lie and say you don't love me?

636
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,370
没有
No.

637
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,710
你为什么要这么伤害我  宝贝
Now, why would you want to hurt me like that, baby?

638
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,060
我也喜欢我伤害你吗
Would you like it if I hurt you?

639
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,360
不
No--

640
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,970
我所做的一切都是为了你  莉莉
All I've ever done is look out for you, Lily.

641
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,700
你也该表示点谢意了
It's time you showed a little gratitude.

642
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,090
放开她  莫里斯先生
Let her go, Mr. Morris!

643
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,250
我告诉过你  离她远点
I believe I told you to leave her alone.

644
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,820
有发现了
We got something.

645
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,630
北康涅狄格有家兽医诊所被人硬闯了
Break-in at a veterinary clinic in Northern Connecticut.

646
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,230
现场发现了印有
Reese's prints were on a prescription bottle

647
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,400
里瑟指纹的药瓶
found at the scene.

648
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,830
你不会一边开车一边告诉我吗
Couldn't be telling me this while we drive?

649
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,340
"匿名线索"个屁
"Anonymous tip" my ass.

650
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,750
这肯定是谁在恶作剧
This has gotta be some kind of joke.

651
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,420
行了  走吧  手放到背后
All right, let's go. Hands behind your back.

652
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,890
血压90到50
B.P. 90 over 50.

653
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,270
脉搏微弱  肋骨骨折  内出血
Thready pulse, multiple fractures, bleeding internally.

654
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,050
我对他说了我没兴趣  然后
I told him that I wasn't interested, and...

655
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,880
他好像受了什么刺激一样
and it was like something in him snapped.

656
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,870
变得更加固执  更加狂躁
He became obsessive and, um, very unstable.

657
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,750
他跟踪了我几个月了  但我一直吓得
He's been stalking me for months, but I was too afraid

658
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,740
不敢告诉别人
to tell anyone.

659
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,810
要不是欧尼及时赶到...
And if Ernie hadn't shown up when he did--

660
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,390
这没什么
That wasn't nothing.

661
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,050
你该看看他们迈阿密
Should've seen some of the guys

662
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,890
派来追杀我的人
they sent after me back in Miami.

663
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,540
你可不会想惹上古巴黑手党的人
You do not want to mess around with the Cuban mafia.

664
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,570
-轻点儿  -抱歉  先生
- Ow--easy. - sorry, sir.

665
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,870
给你
Here.

666
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,250
-这是什么  -柴斯克的枪
- What's this? - Trask's gun.

667
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,310
好吧
Good.

668
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,560
他的真名不是欧内斯特・柴斯克
You know, his name isn't Ernest Trask,

669
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,900
而是欧内斯特・马沙杜
It's Ernesto Machado.

670
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,500
他之前在迈阿密有六间夜总会
He used to own six nightclubs in Miami,

671
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,100
一艘游艇  科勒尔盖布尔斯的豪宅  还有
a yacht, house in Coral Gables, and...

672
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,720
一只宠物老虎
a pet tiger.

673
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,640
全是真的
It was all true.

674
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,090
就连那些有害他健康这点也是真的
Even the part about it being bad for his health.

675
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,450
他在1996年出庭指证了古巴黑手党
He testified against the Cuban mafia in 1996.

676
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,890
至今还在被人追杀呢
Still a price on his head.

677
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,820
他是受保护的证人
He's in witness protection.

678
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,460
所以我们找不到柴斯克太太
That's why you couldn't find Mrs. Trask.

679
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,600
她跟着他从迈阿密来到纽约
She came with him from Miami,

680
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,340
但失去了豪宅和夜店  她撑不下去
But without the houses and the clubs she didn't last long.

681
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,620
她离开了他  去了亲戚那里  在波卡拉顿
She left him, moved in with relatives-- in Boca Raton.

682
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,900
你是怎么查出来的
How'd you find all that out?

683
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,790
我擅长电脑
I'm good with computers.

684
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,220
坦白说吧  芬奇
Be honest, Finch.

685
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,250
根本就没有机器  是不是
There is no machine, is there?

686
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,530
只有你
It's just you.

687
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,550
有下个号码时我会准备好
I'll be ready when the next number comes.

688
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,320
真有意思  这还用你说
Funny you should mention that.

689
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,530
有枪
Gun!

690
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,170
放下  放下
Drop it! Drop it!

691
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,930
没事  纽约警局  已经安全了
It's all right. NYPD. Everything's under control.

692
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,760
趴着
Get down.

693
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,480
卡特警探  这个  就是我们的工作
That, detective Carter, is what we do.

694
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,380
干得好  我的朋友
Well done, my friend.

695
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,630
现在  告诉我
Now, tell me...

696
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,310
那台机器到底是
What on earth was it that made the machine

697
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,680
怎么挑出科兹威尔的号码
pick out Kurzweil's number?

698
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,450
你要我揭密吗
You want me to pop the hood?

699
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,550
当然
Yeah.

700
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,620
2002年11月
November 2002.

701
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,450
这也不是最早的时间
This isn't the first item chronologically,

702
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,600
但是最先引起了机器的注意
but it's the one that triggered a harder look.

703
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,390
-就一张加油站收据吗  -有18张
- A gas station receipt? - 18 of them...

704
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,710
都来自马里兰州陶森市外的加油站
from a shell station just outside Towson, Maryland.

705
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,600
每个月的第三个星期四  科兹威尔
Kurzweil stopped there every third Thursday

706
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,470
都会在那停留  即使前一天已经加满了油
of every even month, even if he'd filled up the day before.

707
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,740
而这18次中有3次
On 3 of his 18 visits,

708
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,120
这辆SUV会在两小时前出现
This SUV was present two hours before.

709
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,200
情报秘密传递点
A dead drop.

710
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,000
那辆SUV登记在
The SUV was registered to the wife

711
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,430
一位土耳其石油大亨妻子的名下
of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets

712
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,700
而此人曾为一个伊朗人购买过两张机票
used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing

713
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,490
而该伊朗人曾涉嫌1994年在
of a Jewish community center

714
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,510
布宜诺斯艾利斯的犹太社区爆炸案
in Buenos Aires in 1994.

715
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,830
这点微弱的线索把科兹威尔联系了起来
The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact

716
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,700
而机器看了出来
and the machine could see it.

717
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,830
它发现了  而且它是对的
It knew, and it was right.

718
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,880
机器对我们每一个人都时刻记录吗
It does this all the time...to all of us?

719
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,120
这太可怕了
That's...terrifying.

720
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,200
你是除我之外
It's probably a good thing that

721
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,900
唯一一个看到这机器如何运作的人
you're the only other person that will ever see

722
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,370
这大概是件好事吧
how this machine works.

723
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,280
完成后  我要加密到极致
When it's complete, I'll encrypt the O.S. so completely

724
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,750
确保这世界上没有一台电脑能入侵它
that no computer on earth will ever crack it.

725
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,960
你不为此烦恼吗  我是说
Does it bother you? I mean...

726
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,940
你的成就具有历史意义
What you've achieved is historic.

727
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,950
却无人得知
But no one will ever know.

728
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,830
只有这样才能保证
It's the way it has to be to be sure.

729
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,970
保证什么
Sure of what?

730
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,760
保证它会按我的意愿被使用
Sure that they'll use it the way I intended.

731
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,960
你认为政府会滥用这台机器
So you think the government would abuse this machine?

732
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,470
丹顿・威克斯花了六个月
Denton Weeks has spent the last six months trying

733
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,970
设法把这台机器弄到国安局
to tunnel into the machine by way of the N.S.A. feeds.

734
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,290
他失败了  但他不会放弃
He's failed, but he'll keep trying.

735
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,570
而且这么想的人不只他一个
And he won't be alone.

736
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,740
我简直不敢想象  如果威克斯这种人
I don't even want to think about what a man like Weeks

737
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,350
拥有了这种力量  后果会何等可怕
would do with that kind of power.

738
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,610
所以我们一定要保证他和其他任何人
