1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,730
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,730
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,550
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,480
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,040
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,680
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,670
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,910
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,780
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,160
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,530
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,230
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,700
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,450
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,020
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,800
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
if you're number's up, we'll find you.

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:57,310
<font color="#00FF00">《疑犯追踪》 第1季 第22集</font>

<font color="#00FF00">-= 人人字幕 =-</font>

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,590
还以为你已经把这玩意儿关掉了
Thought you would have turned this thing off by now.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,570
我们明天才把它移交出去
We turn it over tomorrow.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,340
我要让它尽可能长时间地在线
I'm keeping it online as long as possible.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,890
过去的50亿年里没有你的机器
The world has been spinning for 5 billion years

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,100
地球一样转  哈罗德
without your machine, Harold.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,520
我看再多一个晚上也没事
I'm sure it will be fine for one more night.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,820
说实话  我很高兴能摆脱这玩意儿
Honestly, I'll be glad to be rid of the thing.

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,760
这个"玩意儿"已经成功挽救无数生命
This "thing" has already saved countless lives.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,010
你是指无数"紧要的"生命
You mean countless relevant lives.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,990
我们必须区分轻重缓急
We had to draw the line somewhere.

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,970
每个人都是某些人心中最紧要的
Everyone is relevant to someone.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,620
如果你的生命中
You would know that if you had

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,760
有你真心在乎的人  你就会明白的
anyone in your life you cared about.

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,100
你的成就无以伦比
What you've built here is incredible.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,030
其他人将没有机会告诉你这点
And no one else will ever get a chance to tell you that.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,930
我明白你做出的决定何等艰难
And I don't envy the decisions you've had to make,

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,480
但我真的担心你
but I worry about you.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,250
七年来  你一直观察着别人的生活
Seven years, you've been watching other people's lives,

37
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,270
他们的计划  他们的人际交往
their plans, their relationships.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,350
现在应该抽出点时间给自己了
Maybe it's time for you to invest a little time on your own.

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,100
谁说我没时间给自己
Who says I haven't?

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,290
我知道你喜欢保密  哈罗德
I know you like your secrets, Harold,

41
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,170
但如果你已找到真爱
but if you had found someone,

42
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,890
我肯定早听到耳朵长茧子了
I would never hear the end of it.

43
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,290
你好啊  莱奈尔
Hello, Lionel.

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,980
准备好抓些腐败警察了吗
You ready to bust some dirty cops?

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,670
西蒙斯想让我下周去见HR的头
Simmons wants me to meet the HR brass next week.

46
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,690
那就下周再给我电话  我正忙着调查呢
Then call me next week. I'm busy with research.

47
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,750
调查
Research?

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,300
你是又去跟踪你老板了吧
You mean following your boss again.

49
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,290
你都跟了他好几周了
You tailed him for weeks.

50
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,950
连他住哪里都没找到
You couldn't even find out where he lives.

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,090
是啊  除非你弄到地址
Yeah, well, unless you got an address,

52
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,240
否则咱俩不过半斤八两罢了
I'd say that we're both striking out, huh?

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,750
-芬奇  -我们得见一面  里瑟先生
- Finch? - We need to meet, Mr. Reese.

54
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,590

69
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,610
未婚  独居在玳瑁湾
never married, lives alone in Turtle Bay.

70
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,900
佩克是名注册金融分析师
Peck works as a chartered financial analyst,

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,770
通俗点说  他负责为一家小型金融企业
which is a fancy way of saying he picks stocks

72
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,880
"德克和诺斯联合公司"挑选股票
for a small financial firm, Decker and North Associates.

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,290
金融分析师  引人入胜啊
Financial analyst. It's riveting.

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,150
总不能都是婴儿或者黑帮教父吧
Well, they can't all be baby's and mafia dons.

76
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,020
到目前为止  亨利・佩克最突出一点就是

77
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,060
他的安保措施异常完备
he has better-than-average security habits.

78
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,950
我还无法黑入他的留言箱
I haven't been able to hack his voicemail,

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,410
电子邮箱或者在线账户

80
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,630
神秘  独居
Secretive, solitary...

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,510
他跟你挺像  芬奇
He's just like you, Finch.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,680
你是怎么拿到他的号码的
So how'd you get his number?

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,370
约翰  咱们有机器
Well, John, there's this machine...

84
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,460
没错  但你不是在这里拿到号码的
Yeah, but you didn't get it here.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,490
不是
No...

86
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,750
情况要更微妙
It's much more subtle than that.

87
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,750
我也该知道
And it's time I knew

88
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,970
机器是如何与你进行沟通的
how the machine communicates with you.

89
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,090
为什么
Why?

90
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,820
恕我直言
Not to be blunt,

91
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,190
不过如果你一旦发生意外
But wouldn't you want me to keep doing this

92
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,000
难道你不想我一个人继续下去吗
if something ever happened to you?

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,600
如果发生意外  我有
If something ever happens, I have...

应急预案
a contingency.

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,530
迟早有一天
Well, sooner or later,

96
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,060
你的秘密会被发现的  芬奇
you're gonna need to let the cat out of the bag, Finch.

97
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,060
{\an8}直译：你要让猫从包里出来的

98
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,140
好奇会害死猫的  里瑟先生
Curiosity kills cats, Mr. Reese.

99
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,470
芬奇  到目前为止对佩克来说最大的危险
Finch, so far the biggest threat to Peck

100
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,880
是被纸划伤
is a paper cut.

101
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,670
他个人资料方面有什么幸运发现吗
Any luck getting more info on him?

102
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,280
光凭幸运是搞不定的
It's gonna take more than luck.

103
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,460
公司的防火墙比佩克的还要安全
The firm's firewall is even better than Peck's.

104
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,160
是啊  我能看清他的办公室了
Yeah, I've got line of sight on his office,

105
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,650
但就是接收不到他的无线或手机信号
but I can't get any signals from his Wi-Fi or cell.

106
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,040
他在IQZ电信大楼上班
He works in the IQZ telecom building.

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,540
金融企业就喜欢呆在有互联网集成器的地方
Financial firms like to co-locate with internet hubs,

108
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,790
以方便他们的交易比别人快个几微微秒
so they can get their trades in a few picoseconds faster.

109
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,820
如果接受不到信号
If you're not getting a signal,

110
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,080
可能是被IQZ屏蔽了
it's probably just interference from IQZ's antennas.

111
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,200
没法连上他的手机  芬奇
Couldn't bluejack him, Finch,

112
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,270
所以我改用传统办法  无线窃听器
so I went old school... wireless bug.

113
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,820
艾丽西娅  我是亨利・佩克  又打来了
Alicia, it's Henry Peck... again.

114
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,430
我真的需要跟你谈谈
Listen, I really need to talk to you,

115
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,870
请给我回个电话
so please just give me a call

116
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,800
咱们找地方见一面  好吗
and we'll find a place to meet, okay?

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,530
艾丽西娅  谁啊  前女友吗
Alicia...so who's Alicia? An ex-girlfriend?

118
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,350
还是想甩掉的女友
Or someone he wishes was a girlfriend?

119
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,210
佩克先生  你忘了清除电话记录了
Mr. Peck! You forgot to wipe your phone.

120
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,040
他还得清除电话记录吗
He has to wipe his phone's memory?

121
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,550
现在高管海外旅行经常会有此类要求
It's become common practice for executes traveling overseas,

122
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,300
但在这里  我还是第一次听说
but that's the first time I've heard of it here.

123
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,420
抱歉  我今天有点走神了
Sorry, I guess I'm just a little distracted today.

124
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,960
你工作太累了
Well, you work too hard.

125
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,570
我要知道佩克在办公室干些什么
I want to know what goes on in Peck's office,

126
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,860
既然我们在室外弄不到信号
And since we can't get signals out,

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,910
我只能施展魅力混进去了
I'll have to charm my way in.

128
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,470
您有什么事吗
May I help you?

129
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
是的
Yes...

130
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,250
约翰・鲁尼  财产经理人
John Rooney, assets.

131
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,510
我来见个人
I have a meeting with...

汤姆・布鲁斯特  注册金融分析师
Thomas Brewster, C.F.A.

133
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,450
汤姆・布鲁斯特
Tom Brewster.

134
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,790
我先前跟他通过电话
I'm a tad early.

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,590
窃听器信号消失了
We just lost the feed from our bug.

136
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,170
我这没有此次会面的记录
I don't have a record of that meeting,

137
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,720
没有预约恐怕您不能进去
And I'm afraid nobody's allowed back without an appointment.

138
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,490
也许您应该重新安排一次
Perhaps you should reschedule.

139
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
也许是啊
Perhaps I should.

140
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,760
鄙人莫名惊诧啊  里瑟先生
I'm surprised, Mr. Reese.

141
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,130
那位好姑娘居然对你的魅力无动于衷
That nice young lady seemed somehow impervious to your charms.

142
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,690
那位好姑娘在桌子底下拿点45的手枪指着我
That nice young lady had a .45 pointed at me under her desk.

143
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,040
大门用的是自旋锁  还站着一个警卫
There's a guard and a spin lock on the main door.

144
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,690
这不是家金融公司  是间SCIF
This isn't a financial firm. It's a S.C.I.F.

145
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,430
敏感信息隔离机构
Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.

146
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,730
政府的秘密组织
Secret government installation

147

148

佩克也不是什么金融分析师
Peck's no financial analyst either.

149
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,310
他是个非官方卧底  算是间谍
He's a N.O.C., some kind of spy.

150
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,040
你还觉得他生活无趣
And you thought he didn't have a life.

151
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,480
我们要怎么对间谍采取间谍行为呢
So how do we spy on a spy?

152
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,350
我想我有办法进入了  里瑟先生
I believe I've found a way in, Mr. Reese.

153
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,400
佩克办公室的安全设备对无线信号能拦截
The security in Peck's office blocks wireless signals,

154
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
但是对传统线路呢
but what about good old-fashioned wires?

155
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,990
每间办公室都要靠咖啡因运作
And since every office runs on caffeine,

156
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,280
我们只要把摄像头和接收器
All we have to do is hide a camera and transceiver

157
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,680
藏在一台崭新的咖啡机里
inside a shiny new coffeemaker,

158
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,730
装上线路让信号通过电力系统传出来
wire it to send data out through the electrical system,

159
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,670
然后等他们把咖啡机电源插上
then wait for them to plug it in.

160
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,040
我再给你解释一遍吧
Let me play that for you again.

161
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,430
有信号了  芬奇
Got a signal, finch.

162
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,630
这是哈桑・本・埃米尔的声音
That's the voice of Hassan Ben Amir.

163
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,170
我在米德堡的时候天天都能听到
I listened to him every day when I was at Fort Meade.

164
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,170
{\an8}位于马里兰州  美国国安局所在地

165
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,560
哈桑是个大人物
Hassan is a major player,

166
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,020
一直在资助中东的恐怖活动
funding terror throughout the Middle East,

167
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,220
他打电话到纽约  我们就必须加以注意
and if he's calling New York, we need to pay attention.

168
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,170
现在  根据我们截获的
Now, if you'll look at these intercepts...

169
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,260
佩克是个情报分析员
Peck's an intelligence analyst,

170
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,420
而且听起来  还挺出色
and from the sound of it, a damn good one.

171
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,830
所以他们身处通信大厦
That's why they're in a telecom building.

172
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,370
这样能进入传输线路
They can jack into the feeds.

173
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,390
这是个国安局监听站
It's an NSA listening station.

174
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,200
那我们就好好听着吧
I guess we'd better listen.

175
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,720
好了  芬奇  佩克刚到家
All right, Finch, Peck just got home.

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,130
来看看这位间谍晚上都干些什么吧
Time to see what our spy does at night.

177
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,900
到目前为止  啥事没有
So far...not much.

178
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,040
并不是每个人是交际花  里瑟先生
Not everyone is a social butterfly, Mr. Reese.

179
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,060
对某些人来说  人际互动非常困难
For some of us, human interaction is difficult.

180
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,250
别用"人际互动"这种词  或许有助改善
Not calling it "human interaction" might help.

181
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,990
没日没夜地工作
Works around the clock,

182
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,110
没有朋友  没有家人
No sign of friends or family...

183
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,100
可怜的家伙生活太无聊了
Poor guy doesn't seem to have much of a life.

184
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,980
我们可没资格说人家
Well, we can hardly fault him for that,

185
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,430
别人还都当我们已死呢
seeing as everyone thinks we're dead.

186
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,770
佩克先生  你在吗
Mr. Peck, are you there?

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
佩克先生
Mr. Peck?

188
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,030
陈先生
Mr. Chen?

189
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,410
你的房东打电话来投诉
Your landlord called with a complaint.

190
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,520
介意我们检查一下吗  佩克先生
You mind if we have a look around, Mr. Peck?

191
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,220
这是怎么回事
What's this about?

192
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,190
我也想知道呢
I was wondering the same thing.

193
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,900
显然你的烟雾探测器今天坏了
Apparently your smoke detector was malfunctioning today.

194
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,370
陈先生进来修理的时候
When Mr. Chen entered the apartment to fix it...

195
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,930
发现了这个
He saw these.

196
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,930
安非他明  份量够判重罪了
Adderall, felony weight.

197
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,930
{\an8}上瘾性兴奋剂

198
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,330
什么  这不是我的
What? No, that's not mine.

199
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,420
到警局后我们肯定会给你机会
We're sure they'll give you a chance to explain it

200
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,470
好好解释的  走吧
down at the station. Let's go.

201
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,150
等等  我想在这里就解释清楚
Hold on. I'd rather have the chance to explain it right here.

202
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,770
芬奇  我想佩克的生活
Finch, I think Peck's life

203
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,090
开始有点意思了
just got a little more interesting.

204
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,090
-芬奇  -窃听器回声
- Finch? - Feedback from the bug.

205
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,990
肯定是有杂音混入频道了
Something else must be on the channel.

206
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,940
清除一下就
Trying to clean it...

207
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,990
是相同的信号
It's the same signal.

208
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,330
他身上还有别的窃听器  有别人在监听
There's another bug. Someone else is listening.

209
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,700
是啊  我好像看到他了
Yeah, and I think I've got eyes on him.

210
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,300
我想那些毒品是栽赃的  芬奇
I think those drugs were planted, Finch.

211
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,550
佩克被陷害了
I think Peck's being set up.

212
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,920
问题是  为什么
Question is, why?

213
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
{\an8}《本区》

214
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,580
你会买二十本同样的杂志吗  卡特
You ever buy 20 copies of the same magazine, Carter?

215
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,410
-什么  -没什么
- What? - Never mind.

216
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,420
有什么情况
Do you have news?

217
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,540
佩克一小时前保释离开了
Peck made bail about an hour ago.

218
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,050
我尽可能拿到了亨利・佩克的全部资料
I got everything I could on Henry Peck

219
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,310
并不多
which isn't much.

220
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,530
煎绿茶

221
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,650
只有一个指控记录  佩克申诉撤销了
Only one charge on his record, and Peck had that expunged.

222
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,260
是吸毒记录吗
Does he have a history of drug abuse?

223
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,910
跟吸毒无关  是张超速罚单
Not even close. It was a speeding ticket.

224
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,040
{\pos(244,162)}克雷默纸业公司

225
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,040
{\pos(199,181)}编号JGS-0031

226
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,360
他居然为了超速指控去申诉
He fought to get a speeding ticket off his record?

227
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,110
这是"原则问题"
It was "the principle of the thing."

228
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,040
至少佩克在寄给法官的  用词严谨的
At least, that's what Peck said in his meticulous,

229
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,580
长达78页的报告里是这么说的
78-page brief he sent the judge.

230
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,600
真是爱死这种一根筋到底的人了
Got to love a man who doesn't know when to quit.

231
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,170
-谢了  卡特  -不谢
- Thanks, Carter. - Yep.

232
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,940
佩克不是瘾君子  有人把毒品栽赃给他
Well, Peck's no addict. Somebody planted those drugs.

233
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,750
我去了帕克办公室
I visited the bodega

234
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,150
街边的那家酒窖
that's down the street from Peck's office...

235
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,510
进入他们公司的无线网络
and chatted up their wireless network,

236
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,540
下载了这段录像
downloading this video

237
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,130
有人闯进了他的公寓
of someone breaking into his apartment.

238
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,130
这就是我昨天晚上看到的人
I'm pretty sure that's the same guy I saw last night.

239
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,540
此人受过精心训练
Whoever he is, he's well-trained.

240
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,390
有人盯上了佩克  我们得找出原因
Someone's targeting Peck. We need to figure out why.

241
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,600
在找出幕后主使之前
And until we figure out who's after him...

242
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,510
我会看好佩克的
I'll keep an eye on Peck.

243
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,520
亨利  我们得谈谈
Henry, we need to talk.

244
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,700
我们知道了你被捕的事  还有吸毒的事
We know about the arrest and drug problem.

245
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,270
我根本不吸毒
There is no drug problem.

246
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,690
根据第13526条管理条例
Under executive order 13526,

247
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,210
你的安全许可已失效
your security clearance is suspended.

248
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,390
需等候调查
Pending investigation.

249
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,300
现责令你开始行政休假
You're hereby placed on administrative leave,

250
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,300
{\an8}非商业机构雇员因遭控行为不检暂离工作岗位 
但薪水和福利不变

251
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,530
立即生效
Effective immediately.

252
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,760
拜托  长官  你不能...
Please, sir, you can't just--

253
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,580
出去  亨利
I need you out, Henry.

254
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,630
从现在起  你不能在国安局工作了
As of this moment, you can't work for the NSA.

255
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,270
在这儿工作的七年里
In the seven years I've worked here,

256
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,100
我吃过最强效的药是阿司匹林
the strongest drug I've taken is aspirin.

257
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,970
这事内情不单纯
There's something else going on here.

258
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,630
我是被陷害的
I'm being set up.

259
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,810
如果你是说这里面有什么更大的阴谋
If you're alleging some greater conspiracy here,

260
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,610
我会把这些加进你档案里
I can add that to your file,

261
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,270
但这会显得你情绪异常
but it might make you seem unstable.

262
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,740
质疑权威  然后被视为疯子
Question authority and they call you crazy.

263
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,110
佩克被逼走了
Peck's being forced out.

264
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,680
我不知道你怎么想  里瑟先生
I don't know about you, Mr. Reese,

265
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,830
但我很想知道原因何在
But I'd very much like to know why.

266
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,770
很抱歉一再打电话
I'm sorry to keep calling,

267
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,160
但兹事体大
but it's really important.

268
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,810
拜托  我只是想和泰德・吉布斯谈谈  我
Please, I just need to speak to Ted Gibbons, my--

269
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,750
你好
Hello?

270
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,530
查到那个名字没  芬奇
Recognize that name, Finch?

271
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,290
西欧多尔・吉布斯  国安局副局长
Theodore Gibbons, deputy director of the NSA.

272
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,210
他越级了  还不止一级
He's going over his boss' head, way over.

273
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,030
佩克惹的  是大麻烦
Whatever Peck's into, it's big.

274
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,860
"出国了"  真的吗
"Out of the country"? Really?

275
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,550
但总部里有人刚告诉我
Because some guy at headquarters just told me

276
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,300
他在开会  拜托
he was in a meeting. Please.

277
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,720
我只不过是问了问题
Now, all I did was ask questions.

278
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,270
任何合格的分析员都会  喂
Any decent analyst wou-- Hello?

279
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,790
喂
Hello?

280
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,460
有人因为佩克问了问题而毁了他的生活
Someone is destroying Peck's life for asking questions.

281
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,300
他问了什么
About what?

282
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,970
芬奇  佩克家楼下的监控摄像头
Finch, the security camera over Peck's door,

283
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,260
昨晚是不是好的
was it working last night?

284
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,660
是啊  怎么了
Yes. Why?

285
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,880
有人闯进他家了
Because someone's in his apartment.

286
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,810
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

287
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,310
里瑟先生  一切都好
Mr. Reese, is everything o--

288
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,180
看来不太好
I'll take that as a no.

289
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,170
芬奇  这是政府训练出来的刺客
Finch, I know a government trained assassin when I see one.

290
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,390
他们不光要除掉佩克的工作
They're not just after Peck's job.

291
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,360
华盛顿有人想致他于死地
Someone in Washington wants him dead.

292
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,940
那我们得保护他  里瑟先生
Then we need to protect him, Mr. Reese.

293
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,140
他跑不了太远
He can't have gotten far.

294
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,940
我用窃听器追踪他
I'll use the bug to track him down.

295
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,560
检测到窃听器

296
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,810
检测到窃听器

297
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,770
检测到窃听器

298
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,980
-你好  -你好  我找泰德・吉布斯
- Hello? - Hi, Ted Gibbons please.

299
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,960
你好
Hello?

300
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,020
吉布斯副局长  我叫亨利・佩克
Deputy director Gibbons, my name is Henry Peck.

301
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,260
我在你手下工作
I work for you.

302
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,000
这是我女儿的手机
This is my daughter's cell phone.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,410
你怎么弄到这号码的
How did you get this number?

304
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,570
很抱歉打扰你  长官
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,

305
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,090
但有人想杀我
But someone just tried to kill me.

306
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,860
什么
What?

307
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,890
三周前  你秘密打电话给我
Now, three weeks ago, you called me off the record

308
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,220
祝贺我提交的一份报告
to congratulate me on a report that I submitted

309
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,230
协助了一次高级别捕获行动
that led to the high-level arrest

310
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,140
目标叫卡尔森
of a man named Carlson,

311
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,260
但我从没听说过什么卡尔森
but I never heard of a Carlson.

312
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,710
他的名字在你的报告里
His name was in your report.

313
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,690
但不是我写上去的
But I didn't put it there.

314
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,590
有人把这名字塞进了我的报告里
Someone slipped this name into my report,

315
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,610
而那个名字正是
and that one name was the key

316
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,660
阻止一起大规模恐怖袭击的关键
to stopping a major terrorist attack.

317
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,290
我只不过是问了问题
All I did was ask questions.

318
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,320
结果却被人逮捕  丢了工作
I have been arrested, I have lost my job,

319
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,530
他们还试图处死我
and they're trying to execute me,

320
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,170
我只想知道原因
and I just want to know why.

321
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
不许再打给我
Don't ever call me again.

322
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,720
你还好吗  芬奇
Everything okay, Finch?

323
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,100
我知道谁想让佩克死  也知道为什么
I know who wants Peck dead and I know why.

324
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,430
我知道他问了什么问题
I know what he's been asking questions about.

325
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,380
他们想让他死全因为我
They want him dead because of me.

326
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,170
亨利・佩克全不知情
Henry Peck doesn't know it,

327
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,320
但他一直在问关于机器的事
but he's been asking about the machine.

328
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,680
不用了
No.

329
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,260
出什么事了  艾丽西娅
Is something wrong, Alicia?

330
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,010
你指除了密谋监视无数美国民众
You mean other than being a part of an ongoing conspiracy

331
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,430
之外的事情吗
to spy on millions of Americans?

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,050
是的  但那都是出于好意
Yes, but it's all for a good cause.

333
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,900
后天  货运车将会驶离得梅因
Day after tomorrow, freight train out of Des Moines.

334
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,890
最后六车  货单会显示运输货品是
The last six cars, the manifest will list the contents

335
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,870
已淘汰的电脑部件
as decommissioned computer parts.

336
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,220
你那边怎么样了
What about things on your end?

337
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,340
整个设施是按照你的要求建造的
The facility is designed to the specifications you gave us,

338
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,450
选址方面我们非常谨慎
and it's discreet, where we're putting it.

339
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,320
没人会去找
No one's going to go looking.

340
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,670
还有什么问题吗
Any other problem?

341
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,340
消息封锁
Dissemination.

342
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,350
我们有协议的
We have a protocol in place.

343
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,050
机器一给出嫌疑人
If the machine identifies a suspect,

344
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,550
就会把名字交给合适的部门去解决
the name will find its way to the right people...

345
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,560
且消息源无法被追溯
with no way to trace the intel back to the source.

346
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,710
绝对无法被追溯  否则
There can't be. Otherwise...

347
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,550
我们就全被钉死在那个
We'll all wind up someplace

348
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,680
没人会去找的地方了
where no one's going to go looking.

349
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,190
世上只有八个人知道它的存在
Eight people in the world know it exists.

350
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,650
必须保持住这个数字
We need to keep it that way.

351
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,550
七个  奈森
Seven, Nathan.

352
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,480
只有七个  除非你又和谁说了
Seven people, unless you told someone.

353
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,950
拜托  艾丽西娅  你知道我数学多差
Come on, Alicia, you know I'm terrible at math.

354
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,250
你那边的人
The people on your end...

355
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,410
他们可靠吗
You sure about them?

356
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,740
确保没人发现那台机器
Making sure no one ever finds out

357
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,700
是我们的工作
about the machine is our problem.

358
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,760
我们会搞定
We'll take care of it.

359
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,290
我们已经认识很久了  艾丽西娅
We've known each other a long time, Alicia.

360
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,690
你在为某件事不安
Something's got you rattled.

361
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,150
我没事  奈森
I'm fine, Nathan.

362
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,470
这件事搞定后我就安心了
I'll be happier when this thing is settled

363
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,660
我就能回去正常工作了
and I can go back to my day job.

364
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,260
那到底是什么工作
And what's that exactly?

365
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,520
保密
Classified.

366
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,910
现在你可以请我喝酒了
You can buy me that drink now.

367
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,560
怎么了  卡特
Yeah, Carter?

368
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,360
佩克的邻居报了警
One of Peck's neighbors called 911,

369
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
说他们看见两个男人在那公寓里打架
said they saw two men fighting in his apartment.

370
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,240
没什么事吧
Is everything okay?

371
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,690
问题已经解决了
The situation has been resolved.

372
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,690
我们现在很好  警探
We're fine now, detective.

373
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,850
谢谢
Thank you.

374
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,100
听起来不像解决的样子
Doesn't sound resolved to me.

375
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,770
佩克问了关于机器的事
So Peck asks about your machine,

376
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,560
然后就有人要杀他
and now someone's trying to kill him.

377
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,180
想跟我说点什么吗  芬奇
Something you want to tell me, Finch?

378
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,240
正如所有的电脑系统一样
As with all computer systems,

379
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,980
最大的问题是人为错误
the big problem is human error.

380
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,150
严格来说  那台机器是违法的
Strictly speaking, the machine is not legal.

381
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,350
我一直都知道有特定的措施
I always knew that certain measures

382
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,650
来保护它  但是
would be taken to protect it, but...

383
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,830
但后来发现
but as I found out myself,

384
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,360
我没料到我所托付之人
the people I've entrusted it to are more...

385
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,880
竟如此残忍
ruthless than I anticipated.

386
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,190
-你好  -是佩克吗
- Hello? - Is this Peck?

387
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,930
是艾丽西娅・考文吗
Alicia Corwin?

388
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,410
考文
Corwin?

389
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,340
他想见的艾丽西亚是她
That's the Alicia he's trying to meet?

390
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,770
她之前为国安局工作
She worked for the National Security Council.

391
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,270
考文女士  你在听吗
Miss Corwin, are you there?

392
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,590
你在找我吗
You've been looking for me?

393
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,520
我们能面谈吗
Can we meet?

394
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,880
不能
No.

395
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,250
两个月前  我写的一份报告交至
Two months ago, a report I wrote was changed

396
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,290
你办公室时被篡改了
when it went through your office,

397
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,170
但你的办公室已被关闭一年多了
But your office has been shut down for more than a year.

398
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,090
拜托  我只想弄明白事情原委
Please, I just want to know what's going on.

399
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,910
我只想要回正常的生活
I just want my life back.

400
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,060
咝音
Sibilance.

401
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,990
好吧
Okay.

402
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,310
还有其他能告诉我的吗
Is there anything else you can tell me?

403
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,860
逃
Run.

404
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,720
我们得阻止他  里瑟先生
We need to stop him, Mr. Reese,

405
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,190
不能让他知道更多关于机器的事
from learning more about the machine,

406
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,670
还有咝音  不管那是什么
about Sibilance, whatever that is.

407
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,190
整个事就像传染病爆发
We need to treat this like an outbreak.

408
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,270
佩克被一个概念传染了
Peck is infected with an idea,

409
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,700
但传染就是传染
but infected all the same.

410
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,020
和他说话的人都可能死
Anybody he talks to can wind up dead,

411
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,440
佩克发现的每一点
And everything that Peck uncovers

412
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,340
都让我们救他的希望变得更加渺茫
makes it that much more impossible for us to save his life.

413
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,130
那就帮他找个藏身之地
So let's just get him to a safe house.

414
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,570
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

415
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,440
他会想知道我们是谁
He'll want to know who we are,

416
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,780
而知道这一点会让他
And knowing that would put him closer

417
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,420
离发现机器更近一步
to finding out about the machine.

418
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,080
我们拯救佩克的同时
Whatever we do to save Peck,

419
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,890
必须不让他知晓我们的存在
it must be without him knowing that we exist.

420
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,930
里瑟先生  你有没有在听
Mr. Reese, are you even listening?

421
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,890
现在我们有更大的麻烦了
Well, now we have a bigger problem.

422
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,760
佩克发现了窃听器  把我们甩掉了
Peck found the bug, and he just gave us the slip.

423
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,700
佩克清空了银行存款
Peck's cashed out his bank accounts.

424
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,730
他的刷卡记录出现在全城各处的
His credit cards are popping up at cheap hotels

425
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,660
廉价酒店和酒类专卖店
and liquor stores all over the city.

426
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,130
他大概都施舍给了流浪汉
He's probably handing them out to the homeless.

427
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,030
国安局一定教会了他
The NSA certainly taught him

428
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,120
如何分散网络痕迹
how to scatter a digital footprint.

429
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,890
芬奇  佩克的手机上有发现吗
Finch, are you getting anything off Peck's phone?

430
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,570
不幸的是  他们也教会了他
Unfortunately, they taught him

431
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,430
如何拆散手机
how to brick a cell phone as well.

432
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,740
内存卡无法恢复
The flash memory is unrecoverable.

433
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,230
追杀他的人是什么情况
What can you tell us about the people hunting him?

434
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,130
一支精英小队
An elite squad,

435
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,970
大概是三人小组
probably a three-man team.

436
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,650
和我搏斗那人手枪里装备了步枪弹药
The guy I fought had a handgun chambered for rifle ammunition,

437
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,980
足以穿透防弹衣
So it shreds kevlar.

438
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,640
据我所知只有一支部队把它作为标准配备
Only one unit I know gave those as standard issue...

439
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,160
情报支援行动
Intelligence Support Activity,

440
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,850
一支隐秘性极高的特种部队
an obscure army unit that does black-ops so dark,

441
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,480
严格说来他们甚至不存在
technically, they don't exist.

442
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,420
看来我们最好抢先找到佩克
Guess we better find Peck first.

443
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,610
他们追杀步骤同我一样  从生活必需开始
They'll hunt him like I would, start with his needs...

444
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,950
一个能够睡觉  藏身  获取信息之处
Sleep, a place to hide, and a way to get information.

445
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,730
提供网络  只接收现金的酒店
Cash-only hotels with internet access.

446
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,150
出了点状况
There's been a complication.

447
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,730
目标仍在活动
the target's still in play.

448
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,540
这不是状况
That's not a complication.

449
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,580
这是失败
That's failure.

450
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,460
-他有后援  -是谁
- He has assistance. - Who?

451
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,450
不清楚  估计是我们的人
Unknown. One of ours, I think,

452
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,830
至少曾经是
or at least he used to be.

453
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,300
我们无法做到出其不意
We've lost the element of surprise

454
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,160
和伪造事故现场
and the ability to make it look like an accident.

455
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,410
行动命令是什么
What's the mandate?

456
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
放开手脚
Take the gloves off.

457
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,760
把这事结了
Get it done.

458
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,850
我有条线索  里瑟先生
I've got a hit, Mr. Reese,

459
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,510
地狱厨房的一间青年旅社
A youth hostel in Hell's Kitchen.

460
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,190
我不确定他是否现在还在
I can't be certain he's still there,

461
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,290
但佩克肯定用了那里的电脑
But peck Definitely used their computer.

462
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,160
他查不到关于咝音的任何信息
He wasn't able to dig up anything on Sibilance,

463
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,450
但幸运地找到了破解
but he had good luck finding a pinout

464
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,450
他办公室读卡机的方法
to hack the card reader at his office.

465
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,470
我想佩克先生打算闯进国安局
I believe Mr. Peck is planning to break into the NSA.

466
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,300
他进去了
He's in.

467
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,560
我也是
So am I.

468
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,240
如果你能阻止佩克获得更多
Then I'd very much appreciate it if you would stop Peck from

469
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,950
惹祸上身的信息我一定万分感激
getting any more information that'll get him killed.

470
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,310
现在是不是这样
Correct me if I'm wrong,

471
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,800
如果我去抢报告  他就会知道我的存在
but if I take those reports, he's gonna know I exist.

472
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,030
我知道这一情况很棘手
I recognize this is a challenging situation,

473
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,980
但你必须避免直接接触
but you have to avoid direct contact.

474
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,040
佩克
Peck!

475
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,630
你说对了  里瑟先生  是三人小组
You're right, Mr. Reese. It's a three-man team.

476
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,170
两人半了
2 1/2.

477
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,580
我刚刚非法闯入了那幢楼  知道不
Hey, I just broke in that building, okay?

478
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,320
你会逮捕我吧
You gonna arrest me?

479
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,940
你脑子坏了吗
What the hell's the matter with you?

480
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,460
别弄丢了  那是证据
Hey, don't lose those. That's evidence.

481
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,020
我供认的时候需要的
You're gonna want that when I confess.

482
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,270
放轻松  伙计  等我宣读完你的权利
Relax, pal. Soon as I read you your rights,

483
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,190
你就能畅所欲言了
you can tell us everything.

484
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,500
头低下
Get your head down.

485
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,660
芬奇
Finch?

486
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,900
情况不如你意了
You're not gonna like this.

487
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,510
一切就绪
Everything's in place.

488
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,310
点对点传输需要十天时间
Point-to-point transit will take ten days.

489
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,070
希望接下来十天内全世界都别出事
Hope nothing goes wrong in the rest of the world in ten days.

我们有没有应急预案
Do we have a contingency?

495
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,760
应急预案
A contingency?

496
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,960
艾丽西亚有点  紧张
Alicia seemed... nervous.

497
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,390
万一政府决定
Now, what do we do

498
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,730
滥用这玩意儿  我们怎么办
if the government decides to abuse this thing?

499
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,530
他们是你联系的  奈森
They're your contacts, Nathan.

500
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,520
他们是普通人而已
They're just people.

501
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,770
这玩意儿所象征的权力
The power that this thing represents

502
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,970
你放心让谁拥有它呢
I mean, who would you trust it with?

503
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,270
除了你吗  没别人了
Besides you? No one.

504
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,830
所以我编码机器的方式是
Which is why the machine has been coded in such a way

505
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,530
无法破译的
that it cannot be abused.

506
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,160
甚至无法进入
It cannot even be accessed.

507
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,680
它自我更新  自我维护  自我修复
It upgrades itself, maintains itself, patches itself.

508
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,170
今晚过后  永远没人能改变机器了
After tonight, no one can alter it. Ever.

509
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,100
我曾是个软件工程师  哈罗德
I used to be a software engineer, Harold.

510
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,350
记得吗  在我变成你的对外掩护之前
Remember, back before I became your corporate beard?

511
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,960
任何系统都能被侵入  只是时间问题
Any system can be compromised, given enough time.

512
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,740
我们需要一个紧急开关  一个后门程序
We need an off switch, a back door,

513
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,930
而现在是我们最后的机会了
and this is our last chance to build one.

514
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,790
你是名出色的工程师  奈森
You are a talented engineer, Nathan,

515
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,440
所以你应该记得
so you should remember...

516
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,300
任何漏洞都可以被利用
any exploit is a total exploit.

517
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,430
千里之堤  溃于蚁穴
The tiniest crack becomes a flood.

518
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,500
如果我们在机器上建了后门程序
If we build a back door into this machine

519
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,400
而被别人发现了
and someone else finds out about it,

520
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,970
后果将  不堪设想
That would be...very bad.

521
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,380
我们应该信任机器  就如造它那般
We need to trust the machine, exactly as we built it,

522
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,790
然后放手

我们有此人的通告
We've got a bolo on that guy.

535

把他押送给第八区的卡特警探
Take him to detective Carter at the eighth.

536
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,740
请听我说  他们毁了我的工作
Please just listen. They've taken my job,

537
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,020
毁了我的生活
ruined my life.

538
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,670
现在我知道原因了  这就是证据
Now I know why. This is the proof.

539
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,140
我给国安局写了六份报告
These are six reports I wrote for the NSA,

540
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,590
基于这些报告进行了六次秘密行动
and six covert actions based on those reports.

541
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,000
每次行动  报告中都增加了一个名字
In each case, a single name gets added to what I wrote,

542
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,640
而每一次  那个名字都被证实为
and each time, that name turns out to be

543
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,530
阻止重大恐怖袭击的关键
the key to stopping a major terrorist attack.

544
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,170
六次都是
Six for six.

545
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,550
如此精确的原因只可能是
The only way to be that accurate

546
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,520
超大规模的非法监控
is with illegal surveillance on a massive scale.

547
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,040
还有这个
Then there's this:

548
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,420
"咝音"是国安局的内网审核系统
"Sibilance" is an internal audit of the NSA intranet.

549
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,920
它平常都是例行公事
It's totally routine--

550
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,360
{\an8}信道上无差错传输的最大传输速率

551
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,360
直到他们发现隐藏信号超过了香农极限
until they find signals hidden just beyond the Shannon limit.

552
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,030
那应该只有静电干扰  但是却出现了数据
It should just be static, but there was data.

553
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,270
有人秘密输出的数据规模超过了国安局
Someone is sneaking just as much data out as the NSA is taking in.

554
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,670
要完全扫描这些数据
To scan through all that,

555
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,040
需要十倍于我们规模的机构
you need an organization ten times our size.

556
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,550
这是任何人都无法
It's more than any human--

557
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,820
我的上帝  他们真造出来了
My God, they actually built it.

558
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,710
911事件后  政府想要
After 9/11, the government wanted

559
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,950
一个电脑系统  一台机器
a computer system--a machine--

560
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,170
来监视一切人一切事
that could watch everyone and everything,

561
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,640
在恐怖分子袭击之前就抓住他们
catch terrorists before they strike.

562
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,260
他们试过先驱计划  TIA计划  星风计划
They tried with trailblazer, TIA, stellar wind.

563
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,260
{\an8}皆为美国政府主导基于反恐的信息收集和整理计划

564
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,350
但  但都失败了
They--they all failed.

565
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,610
但如果我没猜错
But if I'm right,

566
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,290
后来确实有人把这玩意儿造出来了
then someone really built the damn thing,

567
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,010
而我们正在被监视着
and it's watching us right now.

568
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,280
好吧  你要来点汽水不
Okay, you want a soda or something?

569
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,860
你审问了我的嫌犯
You just questioned my suspect?

570
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,850
审问你的嫌犯吗
Questioned your suspect?

571
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,890
那家伙自说自话  没玩没了
Guy's in there talking a blue streak all by himself.

572
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,190
简直有被害妄想狂
Should be wearing a tin foil hat.

573
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,270
昨天因藏毒被捕
Gets arrested yesterday for drugs,

574
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,020
今天又朝警察扔杯子
Tonight he throws a bottle at a cop--

575
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,750
那家伙疯了
This guy's out of his mind.

576
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,270
我们得赶快离开这里  亨利
We need to get you out of here, Henry.

577
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,360
你是谁
Who are you?

578
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,710
我想我们可以指望
I suppose we can count our blessings

579
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,760
弗斯科警探并非好奇宝宝
Detective Fusco isn't the inquisitive type.

580
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,810
但佩克的处境更危险了
But Peck's in more danger than ever.

581
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,310
说真的  你到底是谁
Seriously, who the hell are you?

582
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,470
亨利只是问了问题
All Henry peck did was ask questions.

583
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,360
他应该拥有正常的生活
He deserves a normal life,

584
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,080
如果我们想实现这一点
and if we have any hope of giving it to him,

585
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,610
就必须销毁所有证据
we have to destroy all that evidence

586
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,840
并阻止他得到更多证据
and stop him from getting any more.

587
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,600
喂  我叫亨利・佩克
Yes, my name is Henry Peck.

588
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,570
-我是一个分析师  -你电话打给谁了
- I'm an analyst-- - who did you just call?

589
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,150
特别检察官办公室
The office of special counsel.

590
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,860
是保护检举人的机构
It's the agency that protects whistleblowers.

591
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,700
真希望你没让他打那个电话  里瑟先生
I really wish you hadn't let him do that, Mr. Reese.

592
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,450
知道这台机器的人之一
The people who know about the machine,

593
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,420
就在特别检察官办公室工作
one of them works for the office of special counsel.

594
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,820
你在干什么
What are you doing?

595
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,870
我们的政府在监视我们
Our own government is spying on us

596
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,550
还想杀了我掩盖事实
and they want to kill me to cover it up.

597
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,330
我必须告诉别人
I have to tell someone!

598
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,940
你打电话的人不是你所想的
The people you called aren't who you think they are.

599
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,040
任何人都不能告诉  任何人都不可靠
There's no one to tell. No one is safe.

600
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,670
他刚刚打电话给我们了
He just called us.

601
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,410
我把他们最近的已知坐标发给你
I'm sending their last known coordinates.

602
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,620
足够了
That's all I need.

603
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,750
趴下
Get down.

604
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,290
你知道为什么下令杀他吗
Do you know why you were ordered to kill him?

605
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,210
永不提问
Never asked.

606
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,160
好了  佩克  我们赶快离开
Okay, Peck, let's get you out of--

607
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,490
事情还没完  芬奇
This isn't over, Finch.

608
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,780
那家伙连超速罚单都要写78页的报告申诉
The man wrote 78 pages to fight a speeding ticket.

609
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,160
我知道  他不会放弃的
I know. He's not gonna give up.

610
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,110
那些知道机器存在的人也不会放弃
And neither are the people who know about the machine.

611
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,360
那我们到底要怎么办
So what the hell are we gonna do?

612
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,590
一位好朋友曾经让我看到
A good friend once showed me that,

613
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,600
即使是棘手的问题
even with an intractable problem,

614
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,890
也能找到法子做正确的事
one can still find a way to do the right thing.

佩克现在已经开始接触媒体
and now peck's reaching out to the press.

634
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,330
他明天要见一名记者
He's meeting a reporter tomorrow.

635
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,980
我要你除掉他们两个
I want you to silence them both.

636
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,080
我们会的
We'll be there.

637
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,130
你不是记者
You're not the reporter.

638
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,960
不不  我不是  她现在很安全
No. No, I'm not. She's quite safe.

639
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,430
现在  我的伙伴正在处理
Right now, my associate is dealing

640
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,330
要暗杀你们两人的刺客
with the assassins who were sent to kill you both.

641
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,710
你的问题  答案是  是
The answer to your question is yes.

642
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,460
它存在
It exists.

643
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,020
而且此刻正在监视着我们
And it's watching us right now.

644
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,160
我告诉你此事
I'm telling you this

645
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,260
是因为我在你身上看到了自己的影子
because you remind me a little of myself.

646
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,650
而且我知道  如果我是你
And I know that, if I were you,

647
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,510
我会穷追不舍直至找出真相
I would keep asking until I knew the truth.

648
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,490
现在你找出来了
So now you do.

649
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,890
不要再问了
Now stop asking the question.

650
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,310
它在哪儿
Where is it?

651
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,120
它怎么工作  那些服务器单独
How does it work? I mean, the servers alone--

652
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,260
我知道你的感受
I know how you feel.

653
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,780
你想知道
Your need to understand.

654
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,110
但相信我  佩克先生
But believe me, Mr. Peck,

655
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,910
这是你不该去解的谜团
This is a mystery you do not want to solve.

656
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,960
知道答案
Knowing the answer

657
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,270
使我失去了爱愈生命的东西
has cost me something I value more than my own life.

658
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,340
新护照  机票
Clean passport, plane tickets,

659
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,700
用你的新名字办的银行卡  里边有不少钱
a bank card to a well-funded account in your new name.

660
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,330
拜托了  佩克先生  为了你自己好
Please, Mr. Peck, for your own sake--

661
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,000
坦白说  也为了我
and quite frankly, for mine--

662
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,730
去过你自己的生活吧
Go and live your life.

663
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,330
找些属于你的秘密
Find some secrets of your own.

664
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,900
如果你真的需要一个谜团
And if you really need a mystery,

665
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,590
去研究人心吧
I recommend the human heart.

666
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,570
你是怎么知道这些的
How do you know all this?

667
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,920
因为它是我造的
Because I built it.

668
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,850
-卡特  -什么事
- Carter. - Yeah?

669
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,920
那个玩"大变活人"的家伙佩克
That guy Peck who pulled the disappearing act,

670
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,240
我们从一辆烧毁的出租车里找到了
we just pulled his prints off a burnt-out cab

671
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,370
他的指纹  还有一具无名尸
with a John Doe next to it.

672
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,360
那佩克人呢  知道他在哪儿吗
What about Peck? Any idea where he is now?

673
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,420
他已经没影儿了
He's in the wind.

674
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,160
一叠文件在车里被烧掉了
A bunch of paper burned up in that cab.

675
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,280
我们只拿到这个
All we could make out was this.

676
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,640
{\pos(200,154)}咝音

677
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,350
那个HR的事儿定了
Hey, this H.R. deals a lock.

678
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,770
我们有三天时间准备
We get three days to prepare.

679
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,840
到底做不做
Now we gonna do this or not?

680
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,810
我们会准备好的
We'll be ready.

681
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,900
这边一忙完我就给电话你
I'll call you as soon as I'm done here.

682
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,880
是啊  对呢
Yeah, right.

683
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,590
好像你能停止偷窥眼镜先生似的
Like you'll ever be done spying on Mr. Glasses.

684
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,440
下次见你时  我可能已经有他家的住址了
Next time I see you, I just might have his address.

685
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,400
约翰  你的茶好了

00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,080
你好啊  芬奇
Hello, Finch.

692
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,530
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

693
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,900
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to bother you.

694
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,230
我是斯蒂尔斯警探
Detective Stills.

695
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,800
有人举报说这里有情况
Someone reported a disturbance at this address.

696
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,930
真的吗  我一个人住这里
Really? I'm the only one here.

697
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,040
很可能某位老人杯弓蛇影
Probably just an old lady who saw a shadow

698
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,430
或某个孩子的恶作剧
or a kid playing a joke.

699
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,330
我们还是得检查一下
We just have to check everything out.

700
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,310
需要我帮您拿进去吗
Do you want help with these?

701
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,950
好啊  谢谢
Sure. Thanks.

702
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,180
这大概有五十份呢
There must be about 50 copies here.

703
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,880
您是收藏吗
You a collector?

704
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,720
算是吧
Kind of.

705
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,790
他们会送我一些刊登有我作品的杂志
They send me extras when it's one of mine.

706
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,660
您是封面画家
You draw the covers.

707
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,620
是啊  有点太传统  我知道
Yeah. A bit old-fashioned, I know.

708
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,970
一切都数字化了  传统印刷正被淘汰
Everything's going digital. Print is dying.

709
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,070
但是  每次我觉得我肯定没活儿干时
But, every time I think I'll never work again,

710
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,990
别的杂志或报社就会来电话  所以
another magazine or newspaper calls, so...

711
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,250
我想我有个守护天使
Guess I have a guardian angel.

712
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,500
他是谁
Who's this?

713
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,580
那是哈罗德  我的未婚夫
That's Harold, my fiance.

714
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,760
看上去人很好
Looks like a nice guy.

715
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,120
是啊
Yeah.

716
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,360
他人非常好
He's a very nice guy.

717
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,530
我从没想到我能遇到一个懂我的人
I never really thought that I'd meet anyone who got me.

718
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,330
把所有的时间都用来画画
You know, spending all your time alone, drawing,

719
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,010
可不容易找到真爱
isn't exactly the best way to find someone.

720
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,720
但哈罗德找到了我
But Harold found me.

721
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,630
那天我在公园里画画
I was painting in the park one day,

722
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,070
然后  这个男人出现了
And...there was this man,

723
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,630
一月天里  吃着冰淇淋
Eating an ice cream cone in January.

724
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,070
冲我微笑
And he smiled at me.

725
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,330
问我想不想要一个
He asked me if I wanted one.

726
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,790
他跟你住在一起吗
Does he live here with you?

727
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,420
不  没有
No, he doesn't.

728
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,950
以前是
He used to.

729
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,150
两年前我失去了他
I lost him two years ago.

730
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,000
发生了一场意外
There was an accident.

731
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,750
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

732
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,060
地方选得不错
Good location.

733
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,030
视线清楚
Clear line of sight,

734
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,950
又有足够的遮挡物和距离
but enough obstructions and distance

735
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,390
防止她看到你
to avoid being seen.

736
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,420
我编写了一个程序
I built an app that alerts me

737
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,910
如果我和她距离一百米之内就会提醒我
if I ever get within 100 meters of her.

738
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,440
我从未后悔造了那台机器
I've never regretted building the machine.

739
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,180
但我以前没有充分意识到我要为此付出的代价
But I didn't fully realize the personal cost.

740
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,090
我很擅长电脑
I'm good with computers.

741
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,290
但人  除了格蕾斯之外
People--well, people other than Grace--

742
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,090
对我来说一直是个谜
have always been a mystery to me.

743
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,130
我并没意识到
I failed to recognize the lengths

744
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,120
他们为保护和控制机器不惜耗尽漫长的时光
to which they would go to protect the machine, to control it.

745
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,450
当我意识到时候  对我来说  为时已晚
By the time I realized it, it was too late...for me.

746
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,130
但对她还不晚
But not for her.

747
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,410
你看  里瑟先生
You see, Mr. Reese,

748
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,490
如果知道机器的存在是个病毒
If knowing about the machine is like a virus,

749
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,340
那我就是第一感染源
that makes me patient zero.

750
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,510
只是在我身边都会危及她的安全
