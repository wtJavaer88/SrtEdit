1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,830
当你找到你在这个世上的羁绊
When you find that one person who connects you to the world,

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,880
你就变了
you become someone different.

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,250
变得更好
Someone better.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,360
而当她被人从你身边夺去
When that person is taken from you...

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,540
那你又会变得怎样
What do you become then?

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,500
管他想怎么样呢
Whatever he wanna do, you know?

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,900
怎么
What?

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,970
哪弄来的  买麦片送的吗
Where'd you get that, in a cereal box?

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,500
想见识一下真家伙吗
You wanna see a real gun?

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,350
算了吧
Forget you.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,620
是个混混就带家伙了  安东
Every little punk is carrying now, Anton.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,860
所以你父亲才要我们开车回家
That's why your father wanted us to take the car home.

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,790
别紧张
Relax.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,400
我们下周就弄点新装备来
We're picking up new hardware next week.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,860
恢复这里的秩序
Restore a little order.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,480
再说了  我们开车就遇不到新朋友了
Besides, when we take the car, we don't get to meet new friends.

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,290
瞧瞧这位
Look at this guy.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,190
你带的酒不够大家喝啊
You didn't bring enough for the whole group.

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,200
我得教教你怎么与人分享
I have to teach you about sharing.

20
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,600
给那个流浪汉录口供
I'll need a statement from the bum.

21
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,540
他们带他去了哪家医院
Which hospital did they take him to?

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,930
他不肯接受治疗  但我们拿到了监控录像
He declined treatment. We got video on it, though.

23
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,970
你要是多揍那几个小子几拳
You know, you could have done me a favor

24
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,290
也算是帮我忙了
and let those guys land a couple more punches.

25
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,320
问你个问题
Question for you.

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,860
从那卷录像来看
Looking at that tape,

27
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,110
我觉得你是当过兵的人
I'd say you spent some time in the service.

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,470
但在常规部队可练不出这身手
But you don't learn how to fight like that in the regular army.

29
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,930
那你是特种部队的吗
So what were you, special forces?

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,070
三角洲部队
Delta?

31
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,290
我是卡特  你没说你的名字
I'm Carter. You didn't give us a name.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,970
有意思的是
You know, it's funny.

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,400
只有在你有麻烦的时候
Seems like the only time you need a name now

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,020
别人才会问起你的名字
is when you're in trouble.

35
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,630
那我是有麻烦了吗
So am I in trouble?

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,100
我不知道  你说呢
I don't know, you tell me.

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,580
露宿街头的可是你
You're the one living on the street.

38
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,270
我知道这种转换会很不容易
Yeah, making that transition back can be tough.

39
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,450
我认识一些人  他们感到迷茫
Some guys I knew got a little lost,

40
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,770
需要人帮他们适应社会
needed a little help adjusting.

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,150
你需要帮助吗
You need some help?

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,220
当然了  我还认识一些人
Of course, some other guys I knew,

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,790
他们恶事做了太多
they'd done so many evil things,

44
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,230
感觉自己应该受到惩罚
they felt like they needed the punishment.

45
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,190
你是这种情况吗
That sound more like your story?

46
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,520
我失陪一下
Excuse me for a second.

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,830
我是为我的委托人而来
I'm here for my client.

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,740
这家伙的指纹出现在近几年的多个犯罪现场
Your guy's prints were found in half a dozen crime scenes over the years.

49
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,420
四个国家都在公开通缉他
Open warrants in four different countries.

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,370
你这是关了什么人物啊  卡特
Who you got down there, Carter,

51
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,690
死亡天使吗
the angel of death?

52
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,260
多谢帮忙  律师先生
I appreciate the help, counselor.

53
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,430
但由谁来买单呢
But who's picking up... the tab?

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,750
我们的老板想跟你谈谈
Our employer wants to have a word with you.

55
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:47,500


61
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,990
我欠你钱吗
Do I owe you money?

62
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,940
因为我现在...
'Cause I'm, uh...

63
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,070
手头有点紧
running a little short at the moment.

64
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,790
你什么都不欠我  里瑟先生
You don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese.

65
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,310
你比较喜欢这个名字是吧
That's the name you prefer, isn't it?

66
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,310
我知道你有几个化名
I know you've had several.

67
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,800
别担心  我不会把你的事说出去
Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anybody about you.

68
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,850
你根本不知道我的事
You don't know anything about me.

69
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,500
你的事我全都知道  里瑟先生
I know exactly everything about you, Mr. Reese.

70
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,220
我知道你从前为政府做的工作
I know about the work you used to do for the government.

71
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,840
我知道你对此产生了疑虑
I know about the doubts you came to have about that work.

72
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,140
我知道政府还有其他人
I know that the government, along with everybody else,

73
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,420
都以为你死了
thinks you're dead.

74
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,220
我知道你过去的几个月里
I know you've spent the last couple of months

75
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,270
想浸死在酒精里
trying to drink yourself to death.

76
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,400
我知道你还在琢磨更有效的寻死方式
I know you're contemplating more efficient ways to do it.

77
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,570
所以说搜集信息  对我不成问题
So you see, knowledge is not my problem.

78
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,730
可是用这些信息做点什么
Doing something with that knowledge...

79
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,180
就是你的工作了
that's where you'd come in.

80
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,880
你可以喊我芬奇先生
And you can call me Mr. Finch.

81
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,100
我认为我们能互帮互助
I think you and I can help one another.

82
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,470
我觉得你不需要精神病医生
I don't think you need a psychiatrist

83
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,860
互助小组  或是药物
or a support group, pills...

84
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,300
那我需要什么
What do I need?

85
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,230
你需要一个目标
You need a purpose.

86
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,780
具体点说  你需要一份工作
More specifically, you need a job.

87
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,900
这八百万人
Eight million people.

88
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,080
你知道他们有什么共同点吗
You know what they all have in common?

89
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,960
他们都不知道接下来会发生什么
None of them knows what happens next.

90
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,580
每18个小时  纽约就会有一个人遇害
Someone is murdered in New York city every 18 hours.

91
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,370
今天结束时  他们中有一个人会死
At the end of the day, one of these people will be gone.

92
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,210
不幸天天都会发生
Bad things happen to people every day.

93
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,580
这是没办法的事
You can't stop that.

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,900
如果有办法呢
What if you could?

95
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,090
不是指那种飞来横祸
Not the things that happen in the heat of the moment.

96
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,240
有很多罪行要几天甚至几周来策划
But so many crimes are planned days, weeks in advance.

97
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,240
如果你能阻止这些罪行呢
What if you could stop those?

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,120
我有张名单
I've got a list.

99
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,960
名单上的人都将陷入危险
A list of people who are about to be involved in very bad situations.

100
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,760
可能被谋杀  可能被绑架
Murders, kidnappings.

101
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,640
我名单上的这些人
The people that are on my list,

102
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,440
他们还浑然不知会发生什么
they have no idea that anything's about to happen to them.

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,700
他们大多只是普通人
Most of them are just ordinary people

104
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,770
-比如她  -谢谢
- Like her. - Thank you.

105
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,270
她名叫黛安・汉森
Her name is Diane Hansen,

106
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,240
本周她在我名单的首位
and this week she's at the top of my list.

107
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,450
我不知道到底会发生什么
I don't know exactly what's going to happen

108
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,220
也不知道她会扮演什么角色
or what her role in it is.

109
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,010
她可能是被害人  可能是行凶者
She might be the victim. She could be the perpetrator.

110
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,530
我只知道她脱不了干系
All I know is that she's involved.

111
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,660
我要你跟着她  查出会发生什么
I want you to follow her, figure out what's gonna to happen,

112
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,930
并加以阻止
and stop it from happening.

113
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,360
你意下如何
So what do you think?

114
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,810
我觉得你是闲得无聊的阔佬
I think you're a bored rich guy.

115
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,340
我觉得那个女人大概是你前妻
I think that woman's probably your ex-wife

116
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,450
或是你哪天在电梯里搞过一次的女人
or someone you rode in an elevator with once.

117
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,280
不管怎么样  我都要走了
And either way, I think I'm done.

118
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,920
警方今晚在找一名流浪汉进行进一步问话
Tonight police are looking for a homeless man for further questioning.

119
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,260
警方本以为该身份不明的男子
The unidentified man was originally believed

120
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,150
是地铁里遭受暴力袭击的被害人
to be the victim of a violent assault on the subway.

121
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,740
但现在警方将他作为
But now police consider the man

122
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,580
国内多起案件的嫌疑人
a person of interest in a number of crimes nationwide.

123
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,530
宝贝  怎么了
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?

124
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,400
洁西  怎么了
Jess, what's wrong?

125
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,170
你要明白  里瑟先生
You need to understand, Mr. Reese,

126
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,120
我所得到的信息是不完整
the information I have is incomplete,

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,470
但从来不会错
but it's never wrong.

128
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,560
你要知道
You need to know what it would be like

129
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,510
眼睁睁地听着有人被杀
to be forced to listen to someone get murdered,

130
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,570
却对此无能为力是什么感觉
and not be able to do anything about it.

131
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,390
...一  三  八  点  七  X
...one three eight dot seven x-ray.

132
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,090
2008年8月12日  凌晨1点37分
12 August, 2008. 1:37 a.m.

133
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,920
太迟了
Too late.

134
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,920
这盘录音带是三年前录的
This recording is three years old.

135
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,240
一个女人在这间房里被她丈夫杀害
A woman murdered in this room by her husband.

136
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,270
不信读读这个
For the insurance.

137
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,760
你来不及救她了
You were too late for her.

138
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,190
就像你来不及救你朋友洁西卡
Just like you were too late for your friend Jessica.

139
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,380
她遇害时你在地球的另一端
You were halfway around the world when she was killed.

140
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,740
你到底知道什么
What the hell do you know about it?

141
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,700
这是事实
It's the truth.

142
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,520
你离开政府是因为他们骗了你  而我不会
You left the government because they lied to you-- I never will.

143
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,160
我认为你一直以来只是想保护他人
I think all you ever wanted to do was protect people.

144
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,510
这是窃听录音
It's a wire-tap recording.

145
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,620
国家安全局或国外情报监视之类的政府玩意
NSA or FISA. Government.

146
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,800
但你不是政府的人
But you're not government.

147
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,030
的确
No, I'm not.

148
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,520
我想你可以称我为相关第三方
I guess you could call me a concerned third party.

149
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,890
你救不了这个女人
You couldn't have saved this woman...

150
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,470
也救不了你朋友
Or your friend.

151
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,220
但如果你及时知道  你就能救她们
But you could have if you had have known in time.

152
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,020
而这就是我给你的东西
And that's the other thing I'm offering you,

153
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,600
一个及时赶到的机会
a chance to be there in time.

154
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,600
对她来说还为时不晚
It's not too late for her.

155
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,150
你能帮我阻止将要发生的事
You could help me stop what's about to happen.

156
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,410
问题在于  你愿不愿意
The question is, will you?

157
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
疑犯追踪 第一季 第1集

159
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,830
这是什么地方
What is this place?

160
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,320
衰落的西方文明
The decline of western civilization.

161
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,550
城里一半的图书馆都关闭了
The city closed half its libraries.

162
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,200
预算紧缩
Budget cuts.

163
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,740
这栋楼卖给了我手下的一家银行
This building was sold to a bank that I control,

164
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,540
之后立即宣布破产
which promptly declared bankruptcy.

165
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,150
所以这里就被废弃了
So the property's in a kind of limbo.

166
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,930
可以说不存在了
It doesn't exist.

167
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,380
你也是  我查过你
Neither do you. I did a little digging.

168
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,690
里瑟先生  我知道
I recognize, Mr. Reese, that there's a disparity

169
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,580
我们对彼此的了解程度不对等
between how much I know about you and how much you know about me.

170
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,270
我知道你会想要尽快缩小差距
I know you'll be trying to close that gap as quickly as possible.

171
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,360
但我想告诉你我很注重隐私
But I should tell you I'm a really private person.

172
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,340
驾照  信用卡
Drivers licenses... credit cards.

173
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,340
六个掩护身份
Six cover identities.

174
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,300
有待通过代理公司填充的基金
Funds to be replenished through a proxy corporation.

175
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,670
就跟你当年为情报局工作一样
Just like when you were with the agency.

176
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,230
我在情报局工作时
When I was with the agency

177
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,430
我知道谁给我买单
I knew who was picking up the tab.

178
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,360
这就是你的名单吗
This is your list?

179
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,340
那份名单吗
The list?

180
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,310
没错
Yeah.

181
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,690
但你拿到的不是名字
But you don't get names, do you?

182
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,370
这都是社保号码
These are social security numbers.

183
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,760
每个号码都带出一起血案
And each of them map out to a violent crime.

184
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,480
所有这些号码都代表了...
And all of these numbers represent...

185
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,790
错失的机会
Lost chances.

186
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,290
如果你告诉我
I could be a lot more help to you

187
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,870
你从哪得到这些号码  我能帮得更多
if you just tell me where you're getting these numbers.

188
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,310
我从哪得到这些号码无关紧要
It doesn't really matter where I get the numbers.

189
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,500
你只需要知道  下一组号码
What you need to know is that the next number that's up

190
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,630
指向她
is hers.

191
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,440
黛安・汉森

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,670
-她有敌人吗  -一两个

她是地方检察官助理

197
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,270
在她部门定罪记录最高
Best conviction record in her department.

198
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,150
知道这不幸的事件什么时候发生吗
We have no idea when this bad thing might happen, huh?

199
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,080
可能是一周后  也可能是五分钟后
Could be in a week. Could be five minutes.

200
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,350
所有我们要尽可能了解她
That's why we need to learn as much as we can about her.

201
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,030
你打算怎么做
How do you intend to begin?

202
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,740
可以慢慢来
The slow way.

203
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,940
培养感情
Cultivate a relationship

204
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,940
获取对方信任
to allow you to earn the asset's trust.

205
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,340
那要是快点呢
And the fast way?

206
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,610
首先  闯进目标的家
First, you break into their home

207
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,150
游览目标的物品
and go through all their stuff.

208
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,670
电邮  财务记录  私人物品
Email, financial records, personal effects.

209
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,530
然后黑了他们的电话
Then you hack into their cell phone.

210
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,140
只要有电也有信号
As long as it's charged and has signal,

211
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,420
就能用GPS追踪他们
you can use the GPS to track them.

212
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,420
可以用麦克风窃听他们的谈话
You can use the microphone to listen into their conversations

213
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,800
配对成功

214
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,280
不管他们是不是在打电话
whether they're talking on the phone or not.

215
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,750
妈妈  抱歉没打给你
Hi, mom. I'm sorry I haven't called you back...

216
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,960
第三步
Third step--

217
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,290
需要照片
you need picture.

218
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,850
无线摄像头  你可以随时随地监控他们
A wireless camera, and you can keep an eye on them from anywhere.

219
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,350
我知道你担心我  我知道  我没事
I know you're worried. I know. I'm fine.

220
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,470
工作虽然辛苦  但我能照顾自己
It is a tough job, but I can look after myself.

221
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,650
这你知道
You know that.

222
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,620
她很坚强  但有什么事让她害怕
She's tough, but she's scared about something.

223
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,990
由于汉森的工作性质
Given Hansen's job,

224
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,660
有几百个可能对她怀恨在心的人
we've got hundreds of people who could be holding a grudge.

225
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,320
我把范围缩小到两个人
I cut the list to two.

226
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,910
第一个是威勒  她的合作律师
The first is Wheeler, her co-counselor.

227
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,480
去年他们交往过一阵子
They dated for a few months last year.

228
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,370
她分的手
She broke things off.

229
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,090
有时间谈谈么  我请你吃晚饭
You got time to talk? Maybe I can buy you dinner.

230
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,630
我很忙  下次吧
I'm busy. Another time?

231
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,820
是不是出什么事了  我注意到最近…
Is something wrong? I've been noticing lately--

232
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,110
我没事  谢谢  谢谢你
No, I'm fine, thank you. Thanks.

233
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,750
而40%的谋杀案
And 40% of murders involve

234
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,540
都涉及到恋爱关系
Some kind of romantic relationship.

235
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,570
威勒离过婚  有个儿子
Wheeler's divorced. One kid.

236
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,780
一半监护权  要出赡养费  事业也停滞不前
Partial custody, alimony. Career stalled.

237
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,180
我第二个调查的人是劳伦斯・波普
The second person I'm looking into is Lawrence Pope.

238
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,400
汉森现在正起诉的人
The man Hansen is currently prosecuting.

239
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,240
波普因毒品交易吃亏
Pope's on trial for killing his friends

240
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,840
而杀害他那些朋友们而上庭
In a drug deal gone bad.

241
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,190
还牵走了50万现金的毒资
Stole $1/2 million in cash.

242
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,190
波普的帮派或许会找她报复
Pope's gang may be targeting her for reprisal.

243
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,560
我们到达现场时  现场一塌糊涂
When we got there, the scene was colorful.

244
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,400
五人死亡
Five dead.

245
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,710
当中一个在地上爬了十尺好去伸手抓电话
One of them had managed to crawl ten feet to a phone

246
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,060
打911报警
To dial 911.

247
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,760
弗斯科警探  你调查波普先生的时候
Detective Fusco, when you interviewed Mr. Pope,

248
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,390
他当时是怎么给自己辩解的
What did he tell you in his defense?

249
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,470
他说如果是他杀了那几个可怜虫
He said that if he'd have shot the poor bastard,

250
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,960
他会把他们在脑袋上开花
He would have shot him in the head.

251
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,460
引述原话  我一贯的风格  引用完毕
Quote, "Same as I always do," Unquote.

252
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,360
他说他不会杀人杀个半死
He said he wouldn't have left him there half-dead,

253
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,870
使他女人哭泣
Blubbering for his girlfriend.

254
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,850
我问完了  法官大人
No more questions, your Honor.

255
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,200
警探
Detective...

256
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,190
你之前作证的时候多说了很多话
You went a little off script in your testimony.

257
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,420
你从没跟我说起那段对话
You never told me about that conversation,

258
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,120
这样的话波普可能无罪
And it could clear Pope's name.

259
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,160
怎么了  我们抓对了人
What's it matter? We got the guy.

260
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,820
这是我的工作当然有关系
It matters because it's my job

261
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,020
就是为了确保
To make absolutely sure

262
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,410
无辜的人不进监狱
That the wrong people don't go to jail.

263
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,430
记不记得
Do you remember?

264
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,800
不好意思  我以为我们还是站一起的
Excuse me, I thought we were on the same team.

265
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,040
她的案子出了问题
Something's gone wrong with her case.

266
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,500
汉森有动作了
Hansen's on the move.

267
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,070
她打电话给了县拘留所
She's phoning county lockup,

268
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,420
约见波普单独会面
Arranging a meeting with Pope...alone.

269
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,720
难道我的律师就不该在场么
Isn't my lawyer supposed to be here for this?

270
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,460
我可以打电话叫他过来  但是我来的理由是
I can call him if you want, but the reason I'm here is

271
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,480
我不信你谋杀了那些人
I don't think you murdered those people.

272
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,410
我认为当时有别人在场
I think somebody else was in the house

273
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,320
那个911电话发生的时候
When that 911 call was made.

274
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,980
有人告诉你当时发生了什么
Somebody who told you what was said,

275
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,610
就意味着你不在那
Which means you weren't there.

276
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,400
你是不是在保护什么人
Is it somebody you're trying to protect?

277
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,170
你会帮我  是不是
You gonna help me? Is that it?

278
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,660
知道那晚上发生了什么的人
The person who knows what happened that night

279
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,080
一定是你在乎的人
Must be somebody you care about.

280
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,780
是你的弟弟迈克吗
Is it your younger brother Michael?

281
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,930
波普有个弟弟  他卷宗里有
Pope's got a brother. It's in his case file.

282
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,840
有了
Got it.

283
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,330
他有没有看见真凶
Did he see the real killers?

284
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,190
你该到此为止了  女士
You should leave this alone, lady.

285
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,650
我坐牢就坐牢
I can do the time.

286
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,460
这些人太邪恶了  杀人无所顾忌
These people are evil, killing when they want.

287
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,790
而且还有高层罩着
And they're protected from on high.

288
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,360
你再多嘴  他们会杀了我
You keep asking questions, they'll kill me

289
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
我的弟弟  可能还有你
And my brother, and probably you too.

290
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,150
无论这些人是谁 你都能相信我
Whoever these people are, you can trust me.

291
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,340
我们来照顾你和你弟弟
We'll take care of you and your brother.

292
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,370
如果真凶还在逍遥法外  我会找出他们
If the killers are out there, I'm gonna find them,

293
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,500
无论你帮还是不帮
Whether you help me or not.

294
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,300
这是我的工作  而你为什么不...
It's my job. Now, why don't you--

295
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,050
贱人  给我闭嘴
Bitch, you keep your damn mouth shut,

296
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,960
否则我让你闭嘴
Or I'll shut it for you!

297
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,730
我没事
I'm fine.

298
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,500
没事  好了  她没事
Okay. She's okay. She's okay.

299
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,760
芬奇  你是对的
Finch, you were right about Hansen.

300
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,010
不管是谁陷害了波普  她都是下一个目标
Whoever framed Pope will be coming after her,

301
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,620
而且只有波普的弟弟迈克知道他们是谁
And only Pope's brother michael knows who they are.

302
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,310
妈妈  是我  洁西卡
Hi, mom, it's jessica.

303
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,230
我跟辛蒂一起去了墨西哥

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,470
-我长得像辛蒂么  -没错
- I look like a cindy? - yeah.

308
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,590
我还没告诉她我们俩的事情
I didn't tell her about us yet.

309
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,940
这都半年了
It's been six months.

310
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,630
我真希望这个周末永不结束
I wish this weekend could go on forever.

311
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,510
早结束了  都周二了
It already has. It's tuesday.

312
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,850
对  就是说你不得不回基地了
Yes, which means that you have to go back to the base,

313
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,720
然后我就有两周见不到你  我讨厌这样
And I'm not gonna see you again for two weeks, which I hate.

314
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,280
那就开口留下我  我会留下
Then ask me to stay, and I will.

315
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,490
我会辞职
I'll quit. I'll quit.

316
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,160
-好  -我会辞职
- Okay. - I'll quit.

317
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,800
-那就别干了  -已经办了
- Then quit. - I already did.

318
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,170
-什么  -是的
- What? - yeah.

319
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,380
我不想冒险出去打拼
I didn't want to take the chance

320
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,080
然后回来时候发现你不见了
That you wouldn't be here when I got back.

321
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,990
不过首先  我们得再来点龙舌兰酒
But first, we need some more tequila.

322
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,610
曼哈顿的世贸中心
World Trade Center in Manhattan.

323
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,860
亲亲  怎么了  出什么事了
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?

324
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,520
洁西  怎么了
Jess...what's wrong?

325
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,250
是纽约  我不知道
Uh, it's new york. I don't know. I don't know.

326
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,670
今天早上出事了
Something's happened this morning.

327
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,220
有飞机坠毁了吗
Is it a plane crash?

328
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,390
我觉得是两架  是两架飞机
I think it's two. I think it's two planes.

329
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,690
好的  谢了
All right, thanks.

330
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,370
你昨晚去见波普了吗
You went to see Pope last night?

331
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,930
对  我又给了他次机会
Yeah. I gave him one more chance

332
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,960
供出他的同伙  达成交易
To turn in his accomplice, cut a deal.

333
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,650
他给了你什么
He give you anything?

334
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,050
一如既往的没有
No. As usual.

335
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,300
我要迟到了
I'm, uh--I'm late.

336
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,930
她想要找到波普的弟弟迈克
She's trying to track down Pope's brother Michael.

337
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,840
他能指认真凶
He can I.D. The real killers.

338
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,850
而且她在敷衍威勒
And she's stonewalling Wheeler.

339
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,070
怎么  她怀疑他牵扯其中
What, does she think he's involved?

340
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,020
记住  波普说他们有高层罩着
Remember, Pope said they were protected from on high.

341
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,340
慢着
Wait a second.

342
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,810
看来她不相信威勒是有理由的
Turns out there's a good reason she doesn't trust Wheeler.

343
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,360
他可能正和凶手们合作
He might be working with the killers.

344
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,320
而他们正在找迈克・波普
And they're after Michael Pope.

345
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,590
我们最好在他们之前找到那小子
We better get to this kid before someone else does.

346
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,230
迈克  我有话跟你说
Michael...can I talk to you for a second?

347
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,910
你哥让我给你传话
I've got a message from your brother.

348
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,630
-你又不认识我哥  -不完全认识
- You don't know my brother. - Not exactly.

349
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,620
但是我知道你看到了什么
But I know what you saw.

350
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,300
我不是唯一会来找你的人
I'm not the only one looking for you.

351
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,960
你得跟我走
You need to come with me.

352
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,110
救命  救我
Hey! Hey, help me.

353
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,480
这人想把我塞进出租车里带走
Hey, this man is trying to put me in a taxi cab with him!

354
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,020
他想拍我照片
He's trying to take pictures of me.

355
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,140
怎么回事
What's going on?

356
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,060
你们好啊
How you doing?

357
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,690
迈克・波普还在地铁里
Michael Pope's still on the subway.

358
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
等他出来透气的时候
When he comes up for air,

359
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,650
你就用你扔在他身上的手机GPS找到他
You can use the GPS on your phone to find him.

360
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,530
如果波普的话属实
If pope's right about these guys,

361
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,630
那我需要的可远远不止一部手机
I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than a cell phone.

362
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,070
关于这点  我不是很喜欢武器
About that, I don't like firearms very much.

363
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,440
我也不喜欢
Well, neither do I,

364
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,470
但如果要让人拿  我还是觉得我拿最放心
But if someone has to have them, I'd rather it was me.

365
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,980
而且  我地铁上的朋友刚好有点货出手
Besides, my friend from the subway has a line on some.

366
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,440
没怎么用过
Lightly used.

367
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,210
大出血
Steep discount.

368
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,130
老爹  这个怎么样
Pop, what about this one?

369
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,530
你想买那个吗
Are you planning on buying that one?

370
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,700
我只是让那谁看看
I was just showing it to--

371
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,160
放回桌子上去
Put it back on the table

372
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,970
趁还没有别人扁你
Before somebody else kicks your ass.

373
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,970
你们知道男厕所在哪么
Have you guys seen the men's room?

374
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,900
安东你好啊
Hey, Anton.

375
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,750
再见到你真高兴
Good to see you again.

376
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,850
这人你认识
You know this guy?

377
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,390
这可都是些不错的家伙啊
Wow, that's some pretty serious equipment.

378
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,370
你们上过安全教育课没啊
Have you guys taken a safety course?

379
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
比如说  你
Take you, for instance.

380
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,700
你这么横着拿
You're holding that thing sideways.

381
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,200
你就没法瞄准
You can't aim it,

382
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,870
其次  这玩意抛壳时候会打上你的脸
And two, it'll eject a shell casing right into your face.

383
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,570
看
See?

384
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,320
这些我拿走保管
I'm gonna hold on to these

385
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,430
你们就好好地多去练练再来过
While you guys get some more practice.

386
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,830
过得愉快
Have a nice day.

387
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,960
那哥们什么人啊
Who the hell was that?

388
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,870
里瑟
Reese?

389
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,830
我发现了你的手机信号
I got a signal from your phone.

390
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,110
告诉我你找到了迈克・波普
Tell me you found Michael Pope.

391
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,580
他是唯一知道谁会去找汉森麻烦的人
He's the only one who knows who's coming after Hansen.

392
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,240
我找到了  但是有人先一步下手了
I found him, but somebody else found him first.

393
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,740
听好
Listen.

394
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,780
小迈迈
Oh, Mikey.

395
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,450
你会把我们的事都告诉他吧
You were gonna tell him all about us.

396
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,850
是不是  哼
Weren't you? Hmm?

397
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,920
去上城区
Head uptown.

398
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,490
你听见了么
Are you hearing this?

399
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,090
97街跟河滨路交汇口
97th and Riverside.

400
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,090
上去了
Step on it.

401
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,800
我们给他脑后开几个洞
We're gonna put a couple in the back of his head.

402
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,890
弄得看着像是帮派作为
Make it look like a gang thing.

403
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,800
你得动手了
You gotta do something.

404
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,420
放心
Relax.

405
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
我搞定
I'm on it.

406
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,280
不用找了
Keep the change.

407
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,420
你疯了
You're crazy.

408
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,350
我们都死定了
We're both dead now.

409
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,620
你知道他们是什么人吗
Do you know who they are?

410
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,950
现在知道了
I do now.

411
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,560
条子  走吧
Cops. Come on.

412
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,420
你到底把我卷进了什么事里去了
What exactly have you gotten me into?

413
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,920
我不知道
I don't know.

414
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,830
这才是关键问题
That's the whole point.

415
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,050
我雇你来是帮我搞清楚状况
I hired you to help me figure that out.

416
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,540
给
Here.

417
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,800
我觉得我们要对付的是一帮腐败警察
I think we're up against a group of corrupt cops.

418
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,540
斯蒂尔斯是缉毒组的
Stills is narcotics.

419
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,070
他和他手下打听交易
Him and his men get word of deals.

420
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,140
他们偷走毒品和毒资
They steal the drugs, the cash,

421
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,210
还不留活口
And they kill all the witnesses.

422
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,380
而且他们还让弗斯科陷害
And they get Fusco to frame up guys

423
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,780
劳伦斯・波普那样的人来嫁祸他们杀人
Like Lawrence Pope for the murders.

424
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,110
没错
Exactly.

425
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,580
我认为他们的下一个目标就是汉森
I think their next target is Hansen.

426
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,990
但是我不确定
But I don't know for certain.

427
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,390
见鬼  我从不知道什么叫确定
Hell, I don't know anything for certain,

428
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,210
因为你就不肯告诉我
Because you won't tell me

429
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,780
你的信息都是哪里来
Where you're getting your information.

430
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,100
双子塔倒下的时候
When the towers came down,

431
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,770
你在墨西哥的一家酒店里
You were in a hotel in Mexico.

432
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,770
我却在这
I was here.

433
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,600
工作
I was working.

434
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,820
直到晚上才知道白天出了什么事
Didn't even know about the attacks until that evening.

435
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,220
我说  里瑟先生  直到那一天为止
You see, Mr. Reese, until that day,

436
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,190
我都在将我的人生致力于我的财富路
I had spent the better part of my life making myself very rich.

437
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,500
突然之间这些钱对我变得不那么值钱了
Suddenly all that money didn't seem to amount to much.

438
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,400
袭击发生之后
After the attacks,

439
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,030
政府给了自己检阅每封电子邮件
The government gave itself the power to read every email,

440
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,870
监听每通电话的权力
Listen to every cell phone,

441
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,940
但他们需要东西来帮忙整理
But they needed something that could sort through it all,

442
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,740
一样能把恐怖分子在他们动手之前
Something that could pick the terrorists

443
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,510
就从普罗大众里直接挑出来的东西
Out of the general population before they could act.

444
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,650
公众需要保护
The public wanted to be protected.

445
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,150
只是他们不想知道自己是怎么被保护的
They just didn't want to know how they were being protected.

446
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,990
所以当他们最终找到一个有效的系统
So when they finally got a system that worked,

447
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,090
他们保密
They kept it secret.

448
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,460
那你又是怎么知道的
So how do you know about it?

449
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,730
这系统是我造的
I built it.

450
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,600
但是机器有问题
But there was a problem with this machine.

451
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,700
我创造了它好避免下一次911
I had built it to prevent the next 9/11.

452
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,640
但是它却看到了各种犯罪
But it was seeing all sorts of crimes.

453
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,640
所以我不得不教会机器
So I had to teach the machine

454
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,310
将所见的事情分成两类
To divide the things it saw into two lists:

455
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,080
相关和无关
Relevant and irrelevant.

456
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,550
会造成重大伤亡和损失的就是相关信息
Events that would cause massive loss of life were relevant,

457
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,520
而这些信息就会被转到国安局或联调局
So those would be passed along to the NSA or the FBI.

458
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,930
那无关信息呢
And the irrelevant information?

459
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,730
每天午夜机器都会删除这些信息
Every night at midnight, the machine erases it.

460
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,670
直到那以后我意识到了自己的错误
It was only later that I realized my mistake.

461
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:02,910
无关信息名单的事一直在让我纠结
That irrelevant list was eating away at me.

462
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,070
那台机器现在在哪
So where's the machine now?

463
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
主机吗  谁知道
What, the drives? Who knows?

464
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,850
某个政府设施里
Government facility somewhere.

465
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,850
而那些机器
But the machine?

466
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,860
机器无处不在
The machine is everywhere.

467
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,790
无时不在监视着我们
Watching us with 10,000 eyes.

468
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,260
监听着我们
Listening with a million ears.

469
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,670
我怎么和你说发邮件的事来着
What did I tell you about sending email?

470
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,870
三周了  你可以直接搬进来
three weeks, you could practically move in.

471
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,600
别往不是你的电邮里放东西
Never put anything in an email you cannot own.

472
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,540
你自己有办法连进那台机器吗
You gave yourself a way to communicate with it?

473
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,540
我为政府造出一台无比强大的机器
I was building the government a tool of unimaginable power.

474
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,350
我觉得有个开关会比较方便
I thought maybe an off switch would come in handy.

475
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,810
所以我设计了一道后门
So I built myself a back door into it.

476
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,820
就为看到无关信息吗
To access the irrelevant list.

477
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,560
只能看到社保号码
Just a social security number.

478
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,990
要是被人发现  我就看不到了
If anyone ever found out, I'd lose access so...

479
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,160
所以我们只能看到这九位数
Nine digits, that's all we get.

480
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,100
而我们不知道为什么黛安・汉森会被选上
And we have no idea why it picked Diane Hansen.

481
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,500
机器一定是有所察觉
It wouldn't be steering us toward her

482
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,100
不然不会把她选出来
If it wasn't seeing something.

483
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,300
但我不知道我能不能保护汉森
But I don't know if I can protect Hansen.

484
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,370
我不知道整件事是怎么回事
I can't see the whole picture.

485
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,010
我给了你一份工作  里瑟先生
I offered you a job, Mr. Reese.

486
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,510
我可没说这会很容易
I never said it would be easy.

487
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,320
-卡特  -什么事
- Hey, Carter. - yeah?

488
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,490
听说那个安东的事了吗
You hear about your pal Anton?

489
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,620
没有
No.

490
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,630
他和他老子想要买些枪
Him and his father tried to buy some guns.

491
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,730
结果和他们的军火贩子一起被射了
Wound up getting shot with their own merchandise.

492
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,420
他们死了吗
Are they dead?

493
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,960
没有  丢人的是
Nope. Embarrassed enough.

494
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,170
一个穿西装的家伙单枪匹马就搞定了他们
They got taken out by one guy. In a suit.

495
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,950
里瑟  坏消息
Reese? I have bad news.

496
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,480
劳伦斯・波普昨晚在牢房里被人捅了
Lawrence Pope was stabbed to death last night in his cell.

497
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,620
什么
What?

498
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,000
他们想要清理善后
They're trying to cover their tracks.

499
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,060
汉森肯定是下一个目标
Hansen must be next.

500
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,190
你要见面吗
You wanted to meet?

501
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,260
20分钟后在卡纳西区莱森和D大道交口
Remsen and avenue D in Canarsie. 20 minutes.

502
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,230
芬奇
Finch.

503
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
他们要动手了
It's happening now.

504
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,290
有人吗
Hello?

505
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,990
有人在吗
Are you here?

506
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,210
有人吗
Hello?

507
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,000
有人吗
Hello?

508
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,370
你要让我等多久  斯蒂尔斯
Are you gonna keep me waiting, Stills?

509
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,740
我们没时间了
We don't have time for this.

510
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,840
你在担心什么
What's your problem?

511
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,710
波普已经死了
Pope is dead.

512
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,280
我担心的是威勒
The problem is Wheeler.

513
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,710
你个蠢货  他发现了
You idiot, he knows.

514
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,380
他知道了波普的事  也许还不止
He knows about Pope and--and maybe even some of the others.

515
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,320
办公室的文件我能应付
I can take care of the files at the office,

516
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,420
但你们得去搞定威勒
But you have to take care of Wheeler.

517
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,490
就今晚
Tonight.

518
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,730
看看我发现了什么
Hey, look what I found.

519
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,370
有个粉丝啊
We got ourselves a groupie.

520
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,940
身上还带着大杀器
Heavily armed, too.

521
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,440
你认识他吗
You know this guy?

522
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,210
不认识
No.

523
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,110
你不是执法部门的啊
You're not law enforcement.

524
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,980
毒帮的人终于有了点脑子
Cartel finally grow some stones?

525
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,550
派其他人来结果我们吗
Send somebody to take care of us?

526
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,550
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

527
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,920
相关...第三方吗
Concerned... third party?

528
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,120
处理掉他
Take care of him.

529
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,490
今晚再处理掉威勒
And, uh, get rid of Wheeler tonight.

530
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,360
做得干净点
Make it look clean.

531
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,630
斯蒂尔斯
Hey, Stills.

532
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,500
要是你搞砸了  我可不会让自己被拖下水
You screw this up, I won't let it get to me.

533
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,830
我会处理掉你  就像波普那样
I'll take care of you just like I took care of Pope.

534
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,870
我自己一个人也能行
I can look after myself.

535
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,970
这你知道
You know that.

536
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,530
风景不错
Nice spot.

537
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,300
牡蛎湾
It's Oyster bay.

538
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,730
很高兴你能喜欢
Glad you like it.

539
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,970
你会在这里待很长很长时间
You're gonna be here a long, long time.

540
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,900
我很好奇
I'm curious.

541
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,210
你什么时候知道自己会变成一个坏蛋
Was there a point where you knew you'd become a bad guy?

542
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,550
某天早上醒来  我发现我领着工资
Woke up one morning, realized I was paid

543
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,180
保护着一群华尔街的人渣
to guard a bunch of jerks from wall street

544
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,950
而那帮人一直在榨干我们的血汗钱
Who were robbing everybody blind.

545
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,820
他们一下午捞的钱比我一年挣得还多
They're stealing more than my annual salary in a afternoon.

546
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,730
所以我对自己说  管他呢
So I said, "What the hell?"

547
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,560
我不相信
I don't believe you.

548
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,730
我一直在观察你  莱奈尔
See, I've been watching you, Lionel.

549
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,990
你不是真的坏
Your heart's not really into it.

550
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,360
斯蒂尔斯是为钱这么干
Now, Stills, he does it for money.

551
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,640
但我觉得你是出于忠诚
But I think you do it because you're loyal.

552
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,760
有什么区别
What's the difference?

553
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,990
所以我会饶你不死
It's why I'm gonna let you live.

554
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,290
我在考虑在纽约呆上一阵
Yeah, I'm considering sticking around New York for a while.

555
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,280
要真是这样  我需要有内部人士帮我
If I do, I'm gonna need someone on the inside,

556
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,180
而你就是很好的人选
And you might come in handy.

557
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,750
这么说我现在为你工作了咯
Ah, so I'm working for you now, huh?

558
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,790
没错
That's right.

559
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,520
但我有两个规矩
But I've got two rules.

560
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,920
第一  你要是伤害别人
One, you so much as hurt anybody,

561
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,590
我就杀了你
and I'll kill you.

562
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,990
我不太喜欢杀人
I don't particularly like killing people,

563
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
但我可是很擅长
But I'm very good at it.

564
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,170
第二
And two...

565
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,030
你应该更小心点
You have to be more careful.

566
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,800
比如  你要是把人
For instance, if you're gonna put someone

567
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,900
放在你车后座
In the backseat of your car,

568
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:49,170
你最好先好好搜搜身
You have to search them properly.

569
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,170
不  求你
No, please.

570
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,260
你做什么
What are you doing?

571
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,290
你穿着防弹衣吗  警官
You have your vest on, officer?

572
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,990
是的
Yeah.

573
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,590
你到底跑哪去...
Where the hell have you--

574
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,860
没时间了  我们盯错了人
There's no time. We were wrong.

575
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,290
汉森不是目标
Hansen isn't the target.

576
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,560
她是幕后主使
She's the ringleader.

577
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,930
他们今晚要杀威勒
They're going after Wheeler. Tonight.

578
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,480
威勒在楼上
Wheeler's up there.

579
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,720
他晚上大多都要去体育馆
He heads to the gym most nights.

580
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,520
我让多伊尔在楼上盯着他
I got Doyle upstairs staking him out.

581
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,750
这地方简直是个垃圾场
The place is a dump.

582
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,260
没门卫  没探头  毛都没有
There's no doorman, no cameras, nobody.

583
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,490
我们在大厅里搞定他
We'll take him in the lobby.

584
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,090
完事后  我们把凶手带出去
Soon as it's done, we take the shooter out.

585
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,760
让他跑出一段再开枪
Give him a block and then take him out.

586
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
这次可不能留活口  明白了吗
Head shots this time, you understand?

587
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,000
知道知道
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

588
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,870
把那伙计从后备箱揪出来
Get our friend out of the trunk.

589
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,000
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

590
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,070
之前被威勒关进去的小混混
Some ex-con Wheeler put away.

591
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,450
阿扎雷洛  关灯
Azarello, lights.

592
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,050
多伊尔  回话
Doyle, talk to me.

593
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,100
他要出来了
He's coming out now.

594
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,930
来吧  亨利  走吧
Come on, Henry, let's go.

595
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,100
慢着
Wait.

596
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,070
带上你的球  我们走吧
Show me that basketball of yours. Let's go, come on.

597
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,400
见鬼  他还带着个小孩
Damn, he's got his kid with him.

598
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,870
真可惜
What a waste.

599
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,270
亨利  小心
Henry, watch out.

600
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,580
你要杀掉一个男人
You're about to kill a man...

601
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,420
还有他的儿子
And his son.

602
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
求你
Please.

603
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,320
求你别这么做
Please don't do this.

604
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,230
把枪扔掉
Drop your weapon.

605
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,780
其实不是这样的
That isn't true actually.

606
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,920
如果你一直努力练习
If you keep working on it,

607
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,250
如果你一直这么投球
If you keep throwing the ball like that,

608
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,720
你很快就会投得很好了
You'll be able to throw that fast.

609
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,740
-真的吗  -当然
- Really? - Absolutely.

610
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,040
放了他
Let him go.

611
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,750
不行
I can't do that.

612
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,280
我放了他  我和我朋友就要去坐牢
I let him go, my friends and I go to jail.

613
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,820
把你朋友拖出去
Drag your friend outside

614
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,020
带他去看医生
And take him to the hospital.

615
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,890
快去
Right now.

616
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,000
我会杀了你和你朋友
I think I kill you and your friend here.

617
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,870
再把现场弄成是你们自相残杀
Make it look like you killed each other.

618
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,670
然后  因为你惹毛了老子
Then, just because you pissed me off...

619
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,280
我会杀了你家人
I'm gonna kill your family.

620
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
还有你所有朋友
And all your friends.

621
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,680
我没有朋友
I don't have any friends.

622
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,950
我也没有家人
I don't have any family left either.

623
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,290
我曾经绕了半个地球去对付坏蛋
Went around the world looking for bad guys.

624
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,720
但其实这边像你这种人渣已经够多了
But there were plenty of you right here all along.

625
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,470
而现在
So now, essentially,

626
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,380
你又说你其实没看清当时
You're telling us you couldn't see what was happening

627
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,110
在停车场发生了什么
In the parking lot at all.

628
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,580
我问完了  法官大人
I'm done, your honor.

629
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,860
斯蒂尔斯  你在哪

630
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,540
汉森女士
Ms. Hansen?

631
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,220
政府可不是按时间付你薪水  律师
The state isn't paying you by the hour, counselor.

632
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,620
何不让辩方亲自来
Why don't we have the defendant tell you

633
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,790
告诉你真相
in her own words?

634
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,730
我们来听她的报警电话录音
Let's listen to the 911 call she made.

635
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,530
还有
And hey,

636
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,070
今晚再处理掉威勒
Take care of Wheeler. Tonight.

637
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,230
做得干净点  斯蒂尔斯
Make it look clean. And Stills?

638
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,270
要是你搞砸了  我可不会让自己被拖下水
You screw this up, I won't let it get to me.

639
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,210
我会处理掉你  就像波普那样
I'll take care of you just like I took care of Pope.

640
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,470
我自己一个人也能行
I can look after myself.

641
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
这你知道
You know that.

642
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,270
你准备好工作了吗  警官
You ready to get to work, officer?

643
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,340
我帮不了你  我死定了
I'm no good to you. I'm dead.

644
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,710
迟早帮派的人会来对付我
Just a matter of time before the gangs get me.

645
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,340
或是内务部
Or I.A.

646
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,510
没人知道你参与了
No one knows you're involved.

647
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,850
我已经处理好了
I took care of that.

648
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:01,850
另外  他们都忙着找斯蒂尔斯
Besides, they'll be too busy looking for Stills.

649
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,790
警察都以为他跑了
The police will think he's run for it.

650
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,350
而黑帮的人以为他被证人保护了
The gangs and the mob will think he's gone witness protection.

651
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,490
是吗  他真被证人保护了吗
Is that where he is, witness protection?

652
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,160
不  莱奈尔
No, Lionel.

653
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
他在后备箱里呢
He's in the trunk.

654
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,460
唯一的问题是
Only problem is, uh... um...

655
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,670
我不得不用你的枪打死了他
I had to shoot him with your gun.

656
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,370
而这个你解释起来可难了  所以...
And you'd have a hard time explaining that one, so...

657
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,010
得麻烦你再跑一趟了
You'll be taking another trip.

658
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,080
而我这次不会跟着去
And I'm not coming along this time.

659
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,650
要我去哪儿
Where am I going?

660
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,180
牡蛎湾
Oyster bay.

661
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,720
在那儿可很长很长时间没人找得到他
Where no one's gonna find him for a long, long time.

662
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,560
保持联系
I'll be in touch.

663
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,380
现在你能自己决定
You have a decision to make.

664
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,850
机器又跳出一个号码吗
The machine gave you another number.

665
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,450
号码总是源源不断地跳出来
The numbers never stop coming.

666
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,850
这你该预先知道
You should know that up front.

667
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,990
为什么选我
Why me?

668
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:17,460
我已经关注你很长时间了  约翰
I've been watching you for a long time, John.

669
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,330
我们之间的共同点比你想的要多
We have more in common than you might think.

670
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,400
首先全世界的人都以为我们死了
The world thinks we're both dead, for starters.

671
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,870
你让这台机器删除无关信息
You programmed the machine to delete those irrelevant numbers.

672
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,140
现在又想保存下来
Now you're trying to save them.

673
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,040
你为什么改变了主意
What changed your mind?

674
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,790
这么说吧  你不是唯一失去别人的人
Let's just say you're not the only one that's lost someone.

675
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,120
如果你要走
If you wanna leave,

676
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,190
你要多少钱我都能给你
I'll give you enough money to get as far as you need.

677
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,260
你能就这么消失
Disappear.

678
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,290
要是我留下呢
And if I stay?

679
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,360
我们俩迟早会死掉
Sooner or later both of us'll probably wind up dead.

680
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,030
而这次是真的死掉
Actually dead this time.

681
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,170
我说我会告诉你真相
I said I'd tell you the truth.

682
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,240
但没说你会喜欢这个真相
Didn't say you'd like it.

683
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
老实交代  警官
Start talking, officer.

684
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,160
你觉得我会出卖我朋友吗
You think I'm gonna rat on my friends?

685
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,960
拜托  你那些腐败朋友的事留着和地检官说吧
Please. You can tell the D.A. All about your crooked pals.

686
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,530
我想知道他的事  那个追查你们的人
I wanna know about him. The guy who came after you.

687
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,630
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

688
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,000
就是个穿着西装的家伙
It was just some guy alone in a suit.

689
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,170
好吧  那所有你知道关于他的事
Yeah, well, you're gonna tell me

690
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,800
都一五一十地告诉我
Everything that you don't know about him

691
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,140
还有我怎么才能找到他
And where I can find him.
