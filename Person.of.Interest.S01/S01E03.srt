1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,700
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,300
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,540
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,110
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because...I built it.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,340
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖行动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,980
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,040
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,640
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,220
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,010
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,780
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,390
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,420
因为受当局的追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,390
你永远找不到我们
You'll never find us.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,000
不管你是被害人和行凶者  如果你的号码被列出来
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,680
我们就会找到你
we'll find you.

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,810
早上好  芬奇
Good morning, Finch.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
你都不敲门的吗
Don't you knock?

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,650
没必要就不敲
Not if I can help it.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,460
戳穿了你的身份  我感到很内疚
I felt bad about blowing your cover identity.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,790
我在给你找新工作
Been looking for a new job for you.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,230
你可以去遛狗  或是去弹钢琴
Dog walker, maybe. Or concert pianist?

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,670
我有工作  里瑟先生  你也有
I have a job, Mr. Reese, and so do you.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,140
机器又发来一个新的数字
The machine has sent us a new number.

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,580
他名叫乔伊・杜班
His name's Joey Durban,

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,120
107步兵团的士兵
A soldier in the 107th infantry,

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,470
刚从阿富汗回来
Just back from Afghanistan.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,090
陆军奖章
Army commendation medal,

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,690
紫心勋章
purple heart--

31
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,860
这家伙骁勇善战啊
Guy was a fighter.

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,970
跟你一样
Just like you.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,860
我在伊拉克和107步兵团并肩战斗过
I fought besiade the 107th in Iraq.

34
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,770
大多数还都是孩子
Most of them were just kids.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,100
参军的原因多半是因为
Joined up because they lost family or friends

36
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,300
911的时候失去了亲人或朋友
when the towers came down.

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,740
他们在伊拉克要么早早地成熟
Over there, they grew up fast.

38
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,740
要么早早地牺牲了
Or they died.

39
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
不管怎么说乔伊活着回来了
Well, at least Joey came home alive.

40
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,220
现在你得帮他继续保持下去
And now you can help him stay that way.

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,250
他在市中心的一座大楼做门童
He works as a doorman at a building in midtown.

42
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,680
我这就去
I'm on it.

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,650
按照标准的操作程序
Standard operating procedure--

44
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,020
我会克隆他的手机截取通话和短信
I'll clone his phone for voice and texts.

45
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,220
我会跟踪他
I'll start following him.

46
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,090
另外  芬奇
And, uh, Finch...

47
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,430
如果你要开夜车
If you're going to work all night,

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,160
就得多锻炼身体了
you should try getting some exercise.

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,910
你看上去美极了  杰太太
You look fabulous, Mrs. J.

50
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,060
真想约您出去  不过我得先打败拉瑞・希格才行
I'd ask you out myself, but I'd have to fight off Larry Siegel.

51
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,820
你嘴真甜
Thank you.

52
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,380
你好
Hello.

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,630
罗比  我得早点下班
Robbie, I got to take off early.

54
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,810
乔伊和一个叫琵娅・莫雷斯科的姑娘订婚了
Joey's engaged to a girl named Pia Moresco.

55
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,540
他出征时  她等了他六年
She waited six years for him while he was deployed.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,980
过来亲一个
Yeah, come here.

57
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,400
我爱你  乔伊
I love you, Joey.

58
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,860
喂  芬奇
Hey, Finch.

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,400
芬奇  你在吗
Finch, are you there?

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,830
在  有什么问题吗
Yes. Is there a problem?

61
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,540
你在干什么
What are you doing?

62
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,100
没什么
Nothing.

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,810
你不是说好不骗我了吗
Thought you said you'd never lie to me.

64
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,700
到底什么事  里瑟先生
What's the problem, Mr. Reese?

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,140
我们的目标  乔伊・杜班
Our guy, Joey Drban...

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,130
我已经跟了他八个小时了
I've been on him for eight hours, and all he's done

67
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,470
他除了帮老大妈开门
is open doors for old ladies,

68
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,240
就是在逛商店看橱窗
and now he's going window shopping.

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,710
既然机器给出了他的号码
If the machine's given us his number,

70
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,640
那他就肯定有事
he must be caught up in something.

71
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,040
他收到一条短信  有点像密码
He got a text, it's a bit garbled.

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
发过去了
Sending it over.

73
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,190
Anchor d-0
"Anchor d-0."

74
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,710
这是什么意思
This supposed to mean something?

75
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,590
我怎么不知道
I don't know.

76
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,780
你才是负责动脑的哎
You're the genius.

Get down, get down. You, open the door now!

79
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,710

趴下  你  快把门打开  快点

I said, "Get down."

83

低下头

85
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,070
低下头  别看我
Head down. Don't look at me.

86
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,970
还有40秒
40 seconds!

87
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,110
伙计  别动歪脑筋
Not a good idea, pal.

88
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,180
还有30秒
30 seconds!

89
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,620
把钱都包好
Wrap it up!

90

92
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,880
够了
Enough!

93
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,950
我回来了  里瑟先生
I'm back, Mr. Reese.

94
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,430
我破译了那条短信  是个地址
I've deciphered that text-- it's a street address...

95
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,940
是家银行
for a bank.

96
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,830
好吧  芬奇
No kidding, Finch.

97
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,730
刚才那段抱怨这家伙无聊的话
What I said about our guy being boring--

98
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,270
我收回
I take it back.

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,420
女士们先生们  请注意保管好您的财物
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not leave bags unattended.

100
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,450
谨防扒窃
Unattended bags will be...

101
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,120
约翰
John.

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,170
我都不知道你从那边回来了
I didn't know you were back from over there.

103
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,290
洁西卡
Jessica.

104
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,460
我没有  我只是
I'm not. I'm just...

105
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,200
实际上是正要回去
Heading back, actually.

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,070
你的制服呢
Where's your uniform?

107
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,020
我找了份新工作
I got a new job.

108
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,640
还是那种问不得的工作吗
One of those jobs you can't talk about?

109
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,720
这么说我们的那位乔伊是个银行劫匪
So our friend Joey's a bank robber.

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,860
所以机器才跳了他的号码吗
Is that why the machine gave us Joey's number?

111
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,260
我设计这个机器搜索致命的威胁
I built the machine to look for lethal intent.

112
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,360
武装抢劫不太可能跳出来
Armed robbery wouldn't normally make the cut.

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,460
不管怎样  我说直接把他交给纽约警局
Either way, I say we gift wrap him and give him to the NYPD

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,380
免得有人送命
before someone winds up dead.

115
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,440
芬奇  这小子是个好兵
Finch, the guy was a good soldier.

116
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,340
至少让我查出他是怎么惹得一身骚
Let me at least find out how he got into this mess.

117
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,140
好吧  不过别让你的判断被情绪影响了
Okay, but don't let your personal feelings warp your judgment.

118
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,540
又没人逼他去抢银行
No one forced him to go robbing banks.

119
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,710
等等  他和某人见面了
Hang on. He's meeting someone.

120
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,260
他给了她什么东西
He's giving her something.

121
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,600
好像是钱  好多钱
Looks like money-- a lot of money.

122
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,870
那么  另外这个女人是谁
So... who's the other woman?

123
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
还不知道她的名字
I don't know her name yet.

124
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,200
偷情的银行劫匪
Bank robber and a cheat.

125
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,450
听上去不会有好下场啊
Unlikely to have a happy ending.

126
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,070
你觉得他可能要杀其中一个女人吗
Do you think he's targeting one of the women?

127
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,470
有可能
Could be.

128
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,010
看来我只能亲自接近乔伊才能查清楚
Only way I'm going to find out is to get closer to Joey,

129
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,640
这可不容易
and that won't be easy.

130
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,180
这伙人组织严密  异常谨慎
These guys are organized and ultra-cautious.

131
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,280
之间没有不必要的联系
No unnecessary contact.

132
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,380
等等
Hang on.

133
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,040
这个的哥也是抢银行的
That cabbie was at the bank.

134
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,540
他是给他们跑腿的
Just made their courier.

135
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,940
芬奇  查下牌照是5V80的出租
Finch, run a check on cab medallion number 5-victor-80.

136
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,700
司机名叫威利斯
Driver's name is Willis, also an ex-soldier

137
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,100
也是107步兵团的退伍兵
in the 107th infanry.

138
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,600
和乔伊是一个部队的
Same unit as Joey.

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,270
也是一起抢劫的
And also a bank robber.

140
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,770
我入侵了出租车公司的网站
I hacked the taxi company website.

141
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,500
在给乔伊送钱之前
Before he dropped the cash off with Joey,

142
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,040
威利斯开车去了一家在
Willis stopped at a bar in Coney Island

143
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,470
科尼岛的酒吧  叫绿色地带
Called the green zone.

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,050
酒吧主人是前士官长  山姆・拉蒂莫
Bar's owned by former master sergeant Sam Latimer,

145
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,870
第一次海湾战争的退伍老兵
Veteran of the first gulf war.

146
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,090
看来我们找到团伙老大了
I think you just found the gang's ringleader.

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,690
我要接近拉蒂莫
I want to get close to Latimer.

148
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,090
帮我编个身份
And I'll need a cover story.

149
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,260
交给我吧
I'll get on that.

150
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,760
我还要你帮我在这团伙里...
And I need you to create a vacancy for me...

151
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,230
搞个空缺位子
With the gang.

152
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,930
这也不是问题

你要找我帮忙  就是我的问题
You're making it mine.

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,300
我之前在提华纳干私活

我得想办法离他们远点

我有经验  也有技术

收银柜旁有把散弹枪

我还能比你先拿到
And I can get to them both before you.

你要是这么牛逼
So if you're such a hotshot,

186
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,220
还来找我干嘛
What do you need me for?

187
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,490
我喜欢和当地人合作

听说你很有本事

赚了很多钱  还活得好好的
You make a lot of money... you're still alive.

190
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,930
那是因为我从不和那种

191
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,370
死掉的海陆推荐的人合作

192

不用找了
Hey, uh, keep the change.

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,660
我去后备箱拿下箱子
Let me get my case out of the trunk.

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,500
那不是我的东西
Those are not mine!

听说你在追踪一个神秘的特种兵

209
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,270
来  我这边有点信息

214

想要逞英雄  有人阻止了他
Tries to be a hero. Someone stops him

215
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,300
免得他被人爆头
From getting his head blown off.

216
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,970
鉴证科在排查指纹时
When CSU did elimination prints

217
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,270
他们检查了这个保安的枪套

218

是你那神秘人士的指纹

219
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,340
他们拦住他询问了吗

没有  他在第一队人马过去前就走了

221
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,450
不奇怪

看到那些人的移动方式了吗

好吧  我肯定那是军规无线电

224
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,960
他们是士兵
They're soldiers.

225
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,560
所以你那神秘的特种兵才会出现
So your special forces guy fits right in.

226
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,830
我是说  他可能是他们的内线

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,500
我能留着这个吗
Mind if I keep this?

228
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,170
看来你的出租车计划起效啦  芬奇

打的电话基本是叫外卖

几个在圣迭戈的大兵

238
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,110

00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,710
拉蒂莫不是叫你们和我碰面吗
I thought Latimer wanted you to meet me.

240
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,930
他还说要是我们不喜欢你  就一枪毙了你
He also told us to put a bullet in your head If we didn't like you.

241
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,110
而我们确实不喜欢你
And right now, we don't.

242
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,460
我不过是退役老兵  急需用钱
I'm just an ex-soldier, needs some money fast.

243
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,830
你不信任我  无所谓
You don't trust me? Fine.

244
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,900
但05年时我可信任107步兵团的哥们
But the 107 trusted me back in '05,

245
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,600
在提克里特  我信任他们
In Tikrit, and I trusted them.

246
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,230
你他妈怎么知道我们的番号

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,810
那个大块头手臂上有纹身
Big fella's got it tattooed all over his arm.

248
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,630
你别打电话给我们
You don't call us.

249
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,930
只能我们打给你
We call you.

250
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,900
我们一打给你
When we do...

251
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,370
你就扔了手机
You lose that phone.

252
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,010
在战场上杀人是一回事
Killing in battle, in combat, is one thing.

253
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,150
而杀了身边的人
Killing someone up close...

254
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,650
手无寸铁的人
Someone who can't fight back,

255
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,490
那可完全是另一种杀人犯了
That takes a different sort of killer.

256
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,530
乔伊不是这种人
And Joey's not one of them.

257
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,560
所以你觉得乔伊是目标吗
So you think Joey's the target.

258
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,950
那又是谁要害他
Then who's gunning for him?

259
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,960
团伙里的人  还是这两个女人中的一个
One of the gang? One of the women?

260
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,150
我们都不知道他到底怎么被卷进去
Do we even know why he's such a mess?

261
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,410
他有工作  漂亮的女友
He's got a job, pretty girlfriend,

262
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,240
良好的服役记录  他这是自暴自弃
Good service record-- he's throwing it all away.

263
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,380
他会进监狱的
He's going to end up in prison.

264
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,410
-或是死掉  -你说的对  但是
 - Or dead.  - You're right, but...

265
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,350
不是每个复员兵都能遇上你这种深居简出的亿万富翁
Not every ex-soldier meets a reclusive billionaire.

266
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,490
好
Okay.

267
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,160
但是如果乔伊的错误选择
But if Joey's bad choices

268
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,300
意味着他将会去吃子弹
Mean he's about to walk into a bullet,

269
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,730
我们得找出来是谁开的枪
We have to find out who's firing it.

270
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,830
打扰下
Excuse me.

271
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,620
-好啊  -我在找我的女朋友
- Hey. - I'm looking for my girlfriend.

272
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,710
你来这做什么
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,710
只是想过来给世界上最美的女孩子打个招呼
Just wanted to say hello to the most beautiful girl in the world.

274
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,200
你就别给我添乱了
You're gonna get me in trouble.

275
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,200
今天小费好么
Good tips today?

276
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,060
还不错
Not bad.

277
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,540
茱莉生病了  她的份我在领
Julie's out sick, so I got her tables.

278
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,740
有点忙
It's been busy.

279
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,320
那就回去忙吧
You better get back to your shift.

280
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,310
好  差点忘了
Okay. Oh, before you go,

281
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,120
房产经纪说她能今晚带我们去看几个公寓
Realtor says she can show me some apartments tonight.

282
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,150
我真的想让你跟我一起去看
I'd really like it if you can see them with me.

283
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,450
我现在的工作不方便啊
Things are kind of difficult at work right now.

284
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,220
我知道  宝贝  但是这个也很重要
I know, baby, but this is important too.

285
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,530
我只是想我们能再一起做些事情
I just want us to do stuff together again.

286

287
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,930
我在努力啊  小琵  我是真的在努力

288
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,210
约翰  我都不知道你从那边回来了
John, I didn't know you were back from over there.

289
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,150
你的制服呢
Where's your uniform?

290
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,220
我找了份新工作
I got a new job.

291
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,650
还是那种问不得的工作吗
One of those jobs you can't talk about?

292
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,290
是的  我订婚了
Oh, yeah, I got engaged.

293
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,260
我下个月就要搬回东部去了

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,810
我等过你

297
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,950
-我没有让你等  -是的

298
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,550
你确实没有
No, you didn't.

299
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,620
你就那么走了
You just...left.

300
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,920
因为你觉得你会死在那里
Because you thought you'd get killed over there,

301
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,490
觉得那样会伤到我的心
And that that would hurt me.

302
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,260
但是我觉得事实上是
But I think the truth is that

303
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
一个人对你来说更容易
It was easier for you to be alone.

304
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,460
这是你在那边学到的东西
That's one of the things you learn over there--

305
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,500
到头来  我们都是一个人
In the end, we're all alone.

306
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,370
没有人会来救你
And no one's coming to save you.

307
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,740
祝你和彼得幸福
Be happy with Peter.

308
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,150
莫利纳  再给我一些这个团伙的信息
Oh, Molina, I want to know more about this gang.

309

他们干过十几票抢劫案

310
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,290

甚至没伤过人

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,100
进去出来不超过一分钟  每次都是

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,230
-十几桩抢劫案  还挺行啊  -确实
- Dozen robberies. They're good. - Oh, yeah.

317
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,370
这种团伙一般四次五次之后就完了
A gang like this, they usually implode after four or five.

你也知道  他们到时会开始争钱

319
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,170
互相拆台窝里斗
They have a falling out with each other?

320
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,810
这些人不会
Not these guys.

321
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,410
没准这个有帮助
Maybe this will help.

148无线电对讲机  漆成了黑色

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,650
意味着没有监听的可能

326
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,450

买不到
You can't.

331

只能去军队里偷

我跟东部所有的驻军基地都查过了

鼓堡半年前报告了一起无线电货包失窃案件

334
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,500
他们知不知道是谁干的吗

335
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,810
陆军刑事调查科查了  没下文
Army C.I.D. Investigated-- no joy.

336

交叉对比那些住在纽约的人

芬奇啊  我给你发个照片

看来乔伊的小三有个小女孩

觉得那是乔伊的女儿吗

347
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,950
看起来就是这么回事
Sure looks like that.

348
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,680
你应该能找到那孩子叫什么
You should be able to find the girl's name,

349
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,390
阳光幼儿园的防火墙对你来说应该不成问题
If Sunny Days Kindergarten's firewalls aren't too tough for you.

350
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,860
那你干嘛不去找乔伊面对面谈谈
And why don't you arrange a little face-time with Joey,

351
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,890
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

352
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,750
你不是说不准私下接触吗
I thought you said no contact.

353
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,580
你干嘛  跟踪我吗
What are you doing? Following me?

354
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,680
我就住这  哥们  你又是什么借口
I live here, pal. What's your excuse?

355
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,810
我住在科拜街上的一家邋遢影院
I'm staying in a fleapit on Colby.

356

不过我  手头真是有点紧
But I'm, uh, running a little low on funds.

358
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,620
还要多久才能有行动
How long before we get some action?

359
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,060
那就要看拉蒂莫了
That's up to Latimer.

360
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,230
我们只奉命行事
We just follow orders.

361
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,860
命令  你还真是听不厌啊
Orders--don't you ever get sick of them?

362
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,600
也许  但是这让生活简单很多
Maybe. But they make life simple.

363
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,300
让你去走大街  你就去走大街
Told to go down that road, you go down that road.

364
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,840
不过要是叫你过去抢银行
Yeah, you're told to go into that bank,

365
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,870
你就去抢银行 是不是
You go into that bank, right?

366
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,610
我不知道  哥们
I don't know, man.

终于我回到了家  却发现一切都没了

371
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,450
没钱  没工作
There's no money, no jobs--

372
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,830
银行家们要么消失了要么赔得精光
Bankers gone and lost it all.

373
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,460
闹得整个国家鸡犬不宁  我的意思是  就好像
Robbed the country blind. I mean, it's like,

374
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,660
我们出去拼死打仗为的是什么  对不对
What the hell are we fighting for, you know?

375
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,830
我们都是杯具
Joke's on us.

376
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,400

还真是厉害啊
Some serious stuff.

380

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,470
没人求你们去啊
Nobody asked you to go.

382
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,410
说的好像国家欠你们几百万似的
It's not like the country owes you a living.

383
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,570
-我们懂  -才怪
 - We got it, pal. - no.

384
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,110
你们就是不懂
You don't "Got it"--

385
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,510
大言不惭说银行家如何  好像你们很懂一样
Talking about bankers, like you know anything.

386
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,530
我们最近也很不好过

387
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,850
这个我们抱歉  但我们谈话不要插嘴好吗

388
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,820
我们现在不是也再谈啊

389
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,860
你们这种人就要学着适应
Guys like you got to adapt.

现在都知识型社会了
It's the knowledge economy now.

是时候用脑子了  朋友
Time to use this, my friend.

392

396
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,440
你怎么就开始扯上银行去了
What made you start on the banks?

397
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,070
意识到我有的工作
Realized the job that I had

398
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,840
不能满足我去做我想做的事情
Wasn't going to allow me to do the things that I wanted.

399
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,150
我有笔债要还
I had a debt to pay.

400
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,650
-缺钱  -不如说是义务
- Money?  - More like an obligation.

401
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,550
你有孩子吗
You got kids?

402
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,130
没有
No.

403
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,950
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

404

408

409
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,730
所以斯特劳博就一直这么脾气火爆
Is that why Straub's so jumpy?

410
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,000
你要是被炸上天两次  你也跟他一样
You'd be jumpy too, you got blown up twice.

411
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,540

找到那个女人了吗

我们上次赚了有8万

我拿了5万  还是不够
I got five-- it's not enough.

423
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,010
这个事情你也明白  我得洗白了这笔钱再说
Well, you know how it is. I had to clean the money.

424
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,670
就这样就平白打了很多折扣的啊
That's a big, heavy discount right there.

425
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,540
现在  你们都赚了2万了  我赚的可比这少
Now, you guys made 20 grand-- I made less than than that.

426
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,510
那些我欠了钱的人  他们要收走我妈的公寓
People I owe, they're going to take away my mom's apartment.

427
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,840
他们说我签的一张纸上写明了他们有这权利
They said one of the paper's I signed, it gives them the right.

428
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,080
兄弟  我都跟你说白了离放高利贷的远点

那就是说  我没什么路可以走了

-40万  -你没骗我吧

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,410
朋友  你们怎么分
My friend, how you divvy up

441
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,570
就是你们自己的事情了

442
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,240
这个活  你能付清你所有的债
With this job, you can pay off all your debt...

443
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,380
跟曼尼和丹尼一起去龙舌兰酒的天堂

448
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,060
如果说我们没做成一个活
Say we don't make it out of one of these jobs.

449
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,060
如果说我们出现了伤亡
Say we take casualties.

450
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,770
还是照样分对不对
Still the same split, right?

但是你们几个肯定能行

你们是个整体  是个队伍

458

壮小伙  不过那个不是他暴露的原因
A big guy, but that's not what gave him away.

459
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,170
左撇子
He's left-handed.

460
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,170
我们锁定了他手机的GPS

461
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,040
看我们能不能顺着他找到余下团伙分子

462
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,770
挺好  如果泰迪行动了

你就打给我  我不管什么时间

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,020
总得帮着点乔伊

完全信不过他那朋友S
Don't trust his friend Straub one bit.

470
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,330
我可没想过  渗透犯罪团伙  会是
I did not understand "Infiltrate the gang" To mean

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,700
-参加他们的抢劫活动  -我没得选

这么强的火力干啥

追踪了泰迪的GPS信号

就在这附近

警用频道  他们知道我们这地址了

哪里来什么鬼条子了

我们这么就落下了10多万啊
We left like 100 grand up there!

506
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,760
你现在听见了吗  斯特劳博

他有在监听  我们还真是走了大运

都不许动

510
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,400
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what happened--

511
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,290
我们刚进去不久条子就上门了
We hardly got in there before the cops were on us.

512
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,460
乔伊和那个新人  他们说放下钱不要了
Joey and the new guy, they said to leave the money.

513
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,790
他们倒还真是考虑周到
Yeah, how thoughtful of them.

514
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,490
你们让我失望了  斯特劳博
You guys let me down, Straub.

515
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,690
我一定会补偿你
Well, I'll make it up to you.

516
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,160
你得再给我们一次机会  好吗
You got to give us another chance, all right?

517
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,260
那好  是有一单  一笔大生意
Okay, one more-- the big one.

518
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,830
能跟我说说么
Can you tell me what it is?

519
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,370
时机未到啊
In good time.

520
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,300
盯住那个新来的
and keep an eye on the new guy.

521
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,240
你也许需要他进去
You might need him going in--

522
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,540
但不一定需要他出来
not sure you're going to need him coming out.

523
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,210
我们还要怎么装下去
Now how can we wrap this up?

524
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,410
装不下去了  约翰
It can't go on, John.

525
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,340
会有人被杀
Somebody's going to get killed.

526
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,150
让我先和乔伊谈谈
Let me talk to Joey first.

527
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,510
谈什么
To what end?

528
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,420
我想知道他到底亏欠了什么
I want to find out what his guilt trip is.

529
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,950
想办法劝劝他
Try to cure him of it.

530
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,120
这也许没你想的那么简单
Might be more complicated than you think.

531
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,910
我查看了乔伊的账户
I got into Joey's bank accounts--

532
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,190
过去四个月来
Last four months, he's paid

533
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,990
他已经为那个叫艾米・迈尔斯的小女孩
Nearly $10,000 into a 529 savings plan

534
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,760
投入了一万美元在大学储蓄计划上
for the little girl, Amy Myles.

535
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,900
这钱能供她上大学
It'll pay for her to go to college.

536
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,100
艾米肯定是乔伊的孩子
Amy has to be Joey's kid.

537
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,370
不是
But she's not.

538
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,840
根据医院记录来看
Hospital records show

539
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,410
她父亲曾是弗兰克・史蒂芬斯
that her daddy was called Frank Stephens.

540
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,540
曾是
"Was."

541
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,710
在阿富汗遇害

542
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,180
他也在107步兵团服役
He was a soldier in the 107th.

543
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,470
和乔伊是一个单位
Same unit as Joey.

544
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,060
五小时后碰头
We're going to meet in five hours.

545
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,730
有一单新活
It's a new job.

546
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,470
你还想冒险失去这一切吗
You're going to risk it all again?

547
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,240
你知道斯特劳博快失控了
You know Straub's going off the rails.

548
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,310
是  所以我得看着他
Well, yeah. That's why I gotta have his back.

549
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,070
他需要钱
He needs the money.

550
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,940
斯特劳博或许需要  但你不需要
Uh, Straub might. But you don't.

551
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,150
我需要
Yeah, I do.

552
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,850
好吧
That's right...

553
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,250
你有你的义务
Your "Obligation."

554
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,760
是什么来着
What is that?

555
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,600
你有丢下了战友吗
You leave someone behind?

556
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,900
是谁  乔伊
Who was it, Joey?

557
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,730
一个朋友
A friend.

558
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,640
他替我去巡逻
Took my place on patrol.

559
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,810
结果被杀了
Got killed.

560
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,550
为什么他要接替你
Why'd he take your place?

561
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,010
中尉派我去护送一名来访政客
L.T. Puts me on honor guard for this visiting politician...

562
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,950
所以我在擦我的靴子
So I'm scrubbing my boots,

563
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,380
而弗兰克  是的他叫弗兰克  他就去了
And Frank--that was his name--Frank goes out.

564
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,820
他妻子刚生了个孩子
His wife had just had a baby.

565
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,060
一个叫艾米的小女孩
This little girl called Amy.

566
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,340
他真的很开心  说没什么能伤到他
He was so happy, he said nothing could hurt him.

567
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,930
简易炸弹把他炸成了碎片
IED rips him to pieces

568
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,370
那个位置本来应该是我坐
in the seat I should have been sitting in.

569
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,670
所以这是你欠的债吗
So that's your debt?

570
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,850
是的  他给我看过她的照片
Yeah. He used to show me her picture, you know?

571
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,380
他本来要给她整个世界  伙计
He was going to lay the world at her feet, man.

572
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,280
他要送她去上大学  给她一切
Was going to give her money for college, everything.

573
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,580
要是他在的话  他肯定能做到
And he would have done that too.

574
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,980
肯定能
He would have done it.

575
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,220
所以这是你准备做的事
And that's what you're going to do.

576
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,950
你有告诉过别人吗
You tell anyone else?

577
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,790
没有  连我女朋友都没说
No, not even my girlfriend.

578
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,260
所以你还在战斗
So you're still fighting the war.

579
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,160
她还在等你
She's still waiting.

580
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,170
等到这事结束了
When this is done...

581
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,900
我就能完全回到她身边
I'm with her completely.

582
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,540
现在就回到她身边
Be with her now.

583
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,440
别干那单活
Don't do the job.

584
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,640
我朋友被杀了
My friend got killed.

585
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,890
我得照顾他的孩子
Got to take care of his kid.

586
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,160
你是琵娅吧
It's Pia, right?

587
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,270
是的
Yeah.

588
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,700
你比乔伊说的更漂亮
You're even prettier than Joey said.

589
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,740
你是乔伊的朋友吗
You're a friend of Joey's?

590
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,490
战友  我刚来纽约没几天
Army. Just in New York for a few days.

591
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,510
他对你神魂颠倒  你知道吗
He's crazy about you, you know that?

592
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,380
他朋友比我更了解他的感觉
It's funny how his friends know more

593
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,650
真奇怪呢
about what he's feeling than I do.

594
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,750
乔伊他...
Well, you know, Joey's a...

595
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,550
比较喜欢把事情窝在心里
bit of a closed book.

596
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,990
可不是
You're telling me.

597
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,560
不知道他什么时候才能对我打开心扉
Starting to wonder if he's ever going to let me in.

598
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,860
我等了他六年  等他回来
Waited six years for him to come home,

599
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
现在感觉他还在那儿
and it's like he's still over there.

600
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,700
抱歉
Sorry.

601
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,440
我不该随便在客人面前哭诉
Shouldn't go crying all over the customers.

602
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,040
不不不  没关系
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

603
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,480
听我说  像你这么漂亮的女人
Look, you're a beautiful woman.

604
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,530
要是乔伊一直不开窍
If Joey doesn't come to his senses,

605
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,150
何必在一棵树上吊死呢
Plenty more fish in the sea.

606
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,190
不  我吃定他了
No, I'm stuck with him.

607
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,620
我这么小时就爱上他了
Loved him since I was so high.

608
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,270
就是这样
That's the way it is.

609
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,370
你在听吗  里瑟先生
Are you there, Mr. Reese?

610
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,530
和你那伙计乔伊有什么进展吗
Get anywhere with your friend, Joey?

611
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,400
没有  劝不了他
No. Can't cure someone of guilt.

612
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,910
一旦我查出下个活是什么
Soon as I find out what the next job is,

613
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,040
就立刻报警
Go ahead and call the cops.

614
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,880
他们能收拾掉这个团伙
They can pull the whole gang in.

615
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,950
你已经尽力了
You did what you could.

616
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,170
嗯
Yep.

617
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,920
我有发现了
I got something for you.

618
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,220
退役军人  曼尼・桑托斯  丹尼・普拉特
Ex-soldiers-- Manny Santos, Danny Platt.

619
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,990
均被谋杀  枪击头部毙命
Both murdered. Shot in the head.

620
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,730
这是三个月前的事
This is from three months ago.

621
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,160
这有什么关联吗
What made you look at it?

622
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,800
我同时查了之前六个月的鉴证科报告
I cross-checked CSU reports for the last six months--

623
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,900
军用设备
Military hardware items.

624
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,030
看看是什么
And look what came up--

625
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,640
148无线电  编号还可辨认
148 radio. Serial number still legible.

626
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,770
其中一部无线电是从鼓堡偷来
One of the radios stolen from Fort Drum.

627
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,910
这么说桑托斯和普拉特也是劫匪
It means Santos and Platt were robbers too.

628
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,210
他们的团伙就是这么运作
It explains why your gang keeps going,

629
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,750
所以他们从不出差错
Why they don't fall out.

630
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,980
一旦一个团伙做了四五单活  他们就被做掉
Once they've done four or five jobs, someone bumps them off,

631
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,590
重新换一批倒霉鬼
Recruits some new suckers.

632
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,560
但是谁干的
Yeah, but who?

633
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,660
他们有了目标  先生
They have the target, sir.

634
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,030
中心大街底下的长期证据保管处
Long-term evidence lockup under centre street.

635
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,330
在警察总部
Police headquarters.

636
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,870
他们已经知道了编号
They have the cage number,

637
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,140
也下达了明确指令收回那件东西
Precise orders to recover the item.

638
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,540
戒备不严  只有四个半退休的警察
Security's light-- four semi-retired cops.

639
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,470
不妙的是  那地方在中心大街
Bad news-- it's right on centre street.

640
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
那里全是条子
It's crawling with cops and feds.

641
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
我们要偷什么
What are we stealing?

642
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,150
只有一件东西
One item only.

643
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,050
很容易找  所以这次就算你们
Easily concealed, so even you boy scouts

644
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,080
也别让我放弃不要
won't make me leave it behind.

645
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,820
好吧  但那是什么  债券还是珠宝
Yeah, but what is it? Bonds? Jewelry?

646
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,790
不知道  也不在乎  但那玩意值四十万
Don't know, don't care, but it's worth 400 grand.

647
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,590
撤退计划呢
What about exit strategy?

648
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,190
一切都在控制之中  先生
Uh, that's in hand, sir.

649
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,030
老板说这次不能留下后患
Boss says no loose ends.

650
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,060
-明白了吗  -明白
- Understood? - Understood.

651
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,830
反正这伙人已经不行了  该换新人了
The team was cracking up anyway. It's time to refresh.

652
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,240
拉蒂莫给了我们新武器
Latimer gave us clean weapons.

653
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,110
把所有手机  寻呼机都交出来
I want cell phones, pagers, in here.

654
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,810
快点
Come on.

655
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,010
还有你那偷偷摸摸的耳麦
Yeah, even your sneaky little earwig.

656
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,890
没有问题吧
Hey, it's not a problem, is it?

657
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,870
起来
Get up! Get up!

658
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,010
快起来  举起手来
Right now! Get up! - put your hands

659
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,610
在你身后  快走
Behind your back! - move! Move! Move!

660
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,450
走
Move.

661
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,150
乌尔曼的房产有点遗产认证问题
Some probate issues on the Ulman estate.

662
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,250
你有案件编号吗
Have you got a case number?

663
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,460
举起手来  抢劫
Hands in the air! This is a robbery!

664
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,760
出去  快出去
Get out here, now!

665
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,630

快走
Go! Move!

667
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,990
快走
Move! Move!

668
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,600
快点  趴下
Move! Get down! Down!

669
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
守着门和入口
Watch the entrance. Watch the door.

670
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,890
8-2-5-7-6
8-2-5-7-6.

671
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,560
5-7-5

672
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,730
-喂  你  别再盯着我看  -别管他了

673
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,200
没问题
Not a problem.

674
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,230
我说了  别再盯着我看
I said stop looking at me.

675
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,000
拉蒂莫阴了你们  这是个陷阱
Latimer set you up. It's a trap.

676
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,310
坐下  等着
Sit down. Wait here.

677
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,310
7  5-7-5
7, 5-7-5.

678
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,010
8-2-5-7-7-3  就是这个  好了  打开
8-2-5-7-7-3, this is it. All right, pull it.

679
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,350
打开
Pull it. Pull it.

680
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,660
拉蒂莫想阴了我们
Latimer screwed us.

681
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,800
我们得快离开这
We got to get out of here.

682
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,730
你别又来这套
Won't let you pull that crap again.

683
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,100
找到了  8-7-3-3-6
Got it! 8-7-3-3-6.

684
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,910
快走  这是个陷阱
Now move. This is a trap.

685
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,040
怎么着  也许你才是陷阱
You know, maybe you're the trap.

686
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,810
再敢用那玩意指着我  我就用它把你打成残废
Point that thing at me again, and I'll shoot you with it.

687
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,470
走
Let's move.

688
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,350
我们拿到了东西  快走
We got it. Let's move.

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,810
走吧
Let's go.

690
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,410
继续走  泰迪  我抓住你了
Keep moving teddy, I got you.

691
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,060
卡特  我刚接到报告说中心大街的证据保管处发生枪击
Carter, I just got a call of a shooting at centre street, evidence lock.

692
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,650
谁报的警
Who called it in?

693
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,110
街上的清洁工看到四个男人走进保管处
Street cleaners saw four guys go into the lockup,

694
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,710
五分钟后发生了枪击
Five minutes later, shooting started.

695
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,150
那四个男人又跑了出来
Same four guys came running out.

696
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,420
把你送到货车里  泰迪
Getting you to the van, Teddy.

697
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,820

把他送到货车里  我来掩护你们

700
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,510
来吧
There you go.

701
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,160
你们拿到了吗
Did you get it?

702
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,640
你是个好士兵  斯特劳博
You're a good soldier, Strauby.

703
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
快跑
Run!

704
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,550
这天煞的枪开不了火
Damn weapon won't fire.

705
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,470
这枪怎么开不了火
Why didn't my weapon fire?

706
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,890
拉蒂莫肯定对撞针做了手脚
Latimer must have ground down the firing pins.

707
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,130
来吧  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

708
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,760
保管处安全了
The lockup's secured.

709
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,210
警察一旦查出斯特劳博和泰迪的身份
As soon as the police I.D. Straub or Teddy,

710
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,930
他们就会追查到你
They'll be on to you.

711
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,030
你得快离开纽约
You got to get out of the city.

712
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,960
往南或往西都可以
Go south or west.

713
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,370
这里有几千块钱你先收着
Here's a couple of grand to keep you going.

714
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,630
就你的本事  你肯定能找到工作

715
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,900
但你得快走
But go now.

716
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,240
不要回来
And don't look back.

717
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,870
不行
I can't.

718
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,810
不行  伙计
I can't, man.

719
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,180
我在这里还有牵挂
I have someone here.

720
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,260
你要是留下  就只能在牢房里
You stay here, and you'll be looking at her

721
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,510
想她想二十年了
from behind bars for 20 years.

722
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,020
叫她和你一起走
Call her and ask her to go with you.

723
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,360
她爱你  乔伊
She loves you, Joey.

724
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,860
告诉她现在只有你和她两个人了
Just tell her it's gonna be you and her now.

725
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,930
就你们两个人
Just you and her.

726
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,360
你能听到吗
Can you hear me?

727
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,420
我觉得你听得到
I think you can.

728
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,940
我猜你就隐藏在芸芸众生之中
Guess you're out there, hiding in plain sight.

729
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,790
我一直在找你
I keep looking for you.

730
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,590
而我每次都会陷入糟糕的处境
I keep finding myself in some bad situations.

731
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,880
你也可以随时收手
You could always stop looking for me.

732
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,380
绝不可能
Not an option.

733
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,800
现在又死了两个人
Now I've got two more bodies.

734
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,010
我知道人不是你杀的
I don't think you killed those guys.

735
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,730
但我觉得你知道是谁干的
But I think you know who did.

736
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,660
我会处理好
I'll take care of it.

737
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,400
一直在玩危险游戏啊
Playing a dangerous game.

738
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,980
我不知道我能不能理解原因
And I'm not sure I understand why.

739
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,180
我有我自己的原因
I've got my reasons.

740
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,580
也许你有
Maybe you do.

741
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,750
但我抓到的每个杀手都以为自己有足够的理由
But every killer I locked up thought they had a good reason.

742
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,230
而他们的结局也是这样
And that is how this ends.

743
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,830
我迟早会抓到你
Sooner or later, I'll lock you up.

744
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,640
或是在某处发现你的尸体
Or find you bleeding out somewhere.

745
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
那就试试看吧
I will take my chances.

746
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,010
我能记得的就是这些了
I think I've told you everything that I can remember.

747
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,970
警探  过来这边
Detective, over here.

748
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,630
看来他们只拿了这个
Looks like this is all they took.

749
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,030
这么说  你放走了那个抢劫犯啊
So you let our bank robber get away.

750
