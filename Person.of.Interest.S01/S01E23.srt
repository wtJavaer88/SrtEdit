1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,280
你正在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,700
政府有一个秘密的系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,340
一台7X24小时监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,560
我之所以知道 是因为是我建造的
I know, because I built it.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,910
我设计机器的目的是侦查恐怖主义活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,760
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything...

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,550
它看到了牵扯到普通人的暴力犯罪
Violent crimes involving ordinary people,

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,970
像你一样的普通人
people like you,

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,640
政府认为这些犯罪无关紧要
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,020
他们不肯行动  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,870
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,590
一个有能力干预的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,780
因为被当局追捕  所以我们只能秘密地工作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,730
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,730
但如果你是被害者或者肇事者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,650
如果你的号码出现  我们将会找到你
if your number's up, we'll find you.

让我猜猜 我的晚餐肯定又泡汤了吧
Let me guess, I have to cancel my dinner plans.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,350
警探 我们共同的朋友需要帮忙
Our mutual friend needs help, detective.

21

他正在市中心
He's downtown.

22

我一处理完这里的事情马上过去
I'll be there as soon as I get finished here.

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,090
警探 我并不想冒犯 但这是紧急情况

但我现在有些事情
But I have this thing--

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,500
你那事情无关紧要了
Not anymore, you haven't.

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,940
这一直是我信条
It's an article of faith for me

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,210
那就是所有的罪犯 无论多聪明
that all criminals, however clever,

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,980
最终都会露出马脚的
eventually trip themselves up.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,280
你想跟我说说这究竟怎么回事么
You want to tell me what this is all about?

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,110

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
腐蚀Fusco警探的心智去了
Corrupting detective Fusco.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,310
难道他在这方面还没登峰造极么
Does he really need any help in that regard?

41
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,440
我在鼓励他有点大志
I'm encouraging him to show ambition,

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,210
在HR里面争取升官进爵

看看能否找到威胁的潜在来源

Finch 可能她就是威胁
She could be the threat, Finch.

58

Finch 你有在听么

HR现在接受雇凶杀人的业务了

恒温器会有一个活动检测摄像头

那些更为显眼的人员

我的病人有很多病因都与工作有关

Reese先生 我设法去查阅了

资助HR的那个提存账户

233
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,820
向女心理医生倾诉

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,060
这比跟他们的妻子倾诉容易得多
It's easier than talking to their wives.

235
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,530

一个充满秘密的火药桶上

如果你正确的处理这件事 就会很有利可图

251
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,270
或一旦失误 足以致命

没有临街商店 极少行人 没有摄像头
No storefronts, low foot traffic, no cameras.

260
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,590
一旦她从那个街角转弯 就踏入雷区了

That's bad news for you, my friend.

305
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,250
你要是处理不好这事 我们可不会冒险
You don't clean this up,we're not gonna take the risk

306
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,850
给你叛变的机会
you'll turn state's.

307
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,180
要么你杀了他们
You kill them...

308
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,950
要么我杀了你
Or I'll kill you.

309
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,360
我们在这干吗
What are we doing here?

310
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,790
我们需要一个藏身的地方 重新部署
We need a place to hide,to regroup.

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,870
就拿那间
We'll take it.

316
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,680
周边有太多警察
Too many cops in the neighborhood.

317
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,650
我们得潜伏在酒店里一直到早上
We'll need to lay low in the hotel till morning.

318
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,790
正在为你寻找逃脱路线 Reese先生

一个足智多谋的朋友
A very resourceful friend.

324
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,340
让我猜猜 我的晚餐肯定又泡汤了吧
Let me guess, I have to cancel my dinner plans.

325
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,500
警探 我们共同的朋友需要帮忙
Our mutual friend needs help, detective.

326
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,700
他正在市中心
He's downtown.

327
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,410
我一处理完这里的事情马上过去
I'll be there as soon as I get finished here.

328
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,280
警探 我并不想冒犯 但这是紧急情况
I hate to be rude, but it's an emergency, detective.

But I have this thing--

333
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,690
你那事情无关紧要了
Not anymore, you haven't.

334
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,290
我不懂
I don't understand.

335
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,830
谁会想杀我
Who would want to kill me?

336
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,500
我还希望你能告诉我呢
I was hoping you could tell me that.

337
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,830
某个人有这个手段和财力
Someone with the means and the money

338
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,670
雇一队杀手来除掉你

339
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,500
听上去像你的某个病人吗
Sound like any of your patients?

340
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,310
像 每个都是这样
Yeah.All of them.

341
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,770
想引走这帮人 唯一的办法
The only way to call off the dogs

342
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,710
就是找出他们的雇主
is to find out who hired them.

343
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,910
我 我想不出来
I-I can't think.

344
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,720
我动不了都
I can't move.

345
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,950
这肯定就是所谓惊慌的感觉吧
This must be what panic feels like.

346
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,030
对 吃点巧克力吧
Here, have some chocolate.

347
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,800
吃这个能产生肾上腺素类的效果吗
Will these help to produce an adrenaline response?

348
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,170
不能 但是它们很好吃
No, but they taste good.

349
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,100
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

350
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,640
差不多就是我们都帮助人们
Let's just say we both help people cope

351
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,240
解决问题
with their problems.

352
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,150
只不过我更加倾向于直接行动
I'm just a little bit more,uh, hands-on.

353
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,480
我保证
I promise...

354
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,250
我会告诉你什么时候该惊慌的
I will tell you when it's time to panic.

355
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,220
Carter 这位是Sagan警探 来自纽约警局
Carter, this is Detective Sagan, NYPD.

356
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,590
你要给她展示一下
You want to give her a little demonstration

357
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,690
你的成果吗
of what you do?

358
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,760
这段录像是90分钟以前的
This footage is from 90 minutes ago.

359
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,960
我们收到了枪击的报告

然后他带着这个年轻女人逃逸了

361
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,900
我们认为她是人质 之后就没有他们的行踪了
We think she's a hostage. We lost them after that.

362
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,500
但我们确定 他们仍在方圆六个街区之内
But we're confident they're still in this six-block radius.

363
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,970
而这恰好是全世界受监控最严密的六个街区
Which happens to be the most heavily surveilled six blocks

364
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,210
这是一次联邦搜捕行动
in the world.This is now a federal manhunt.

365
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,610
在这看到你真惊讶 Fusco
Surprised to see you here, Fusco.

366
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,220
你知道的 我喜欢呆在行动现场

你还好吗

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,330
好一点了

369
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,470
我需要一些帮助 Finch

370

HR找到了我们的藏身地
HR just found us somehow.

371
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,670
离他们找到我们的房间 大概只有两三分钟
It's probably two, three minutes before they find our room.

372
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,980
所以不能下楼了
So going down probably isn't an option.

373
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,110
我在研究方案
I'll look into it.

374
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,150
Reese先生 我想我找到了些东西
Mr. Reese, I think I've found something.

375
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,580
楼顶原先的占有者
Previous occupant of the penthouse

376
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,520
最近因为偷税坐牢去了
recently went to jail for tax evasion,

377
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,650
国税部还没有扣押全部的资产
but the IRS hasn't yet seized everything.

378
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,420
重点呢 Harold
The point, Harold?

379
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,460
我知道你很擅长偷车
I know you're good at stealing cars.

380
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,590
你觉得直升机怎样
How do you feel about helicopters?

381
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,460
离我上次飞已经好一段时间了
It's been a while since I've flown.

382
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,860
可能有点手生
Might be a little rusty.

383
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,400
乐观地看 如果你忘了怎么飞
On the bright side,if you don't remember,

384
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,570
也不会摔太狠的
it'll be a short fall.

385
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,920
等一下 等一下 回去
Wait, wait, go back.

通知我们的人到那家酒店集合
Notify our men to converge on that hotel.

388
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,160
无疑冒犯 警探
Uh, all due respect, Detective.

389
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,330
不过纽约警局这次不用参与了
NYPD's gonna sit this one out.

390
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,460
- 派我们的小组过去  - 遵命长官
- Send in our teams.  - Yes, sir.

391
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,310
去楼梯 快

你救我 是为了过去
You saving me, is this making up

393
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,130
没有救某人而做补偿吗
for someone you didn't save?

394
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,960
我以为已经不用再做治疗了
I thought we were done with therapy.

395
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,530
谈论你的问题能让我分心
Talking about your issues helps distract me.

396
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,800
谁说我有问题的
Who said I had issues?

397
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,130
那我就当是有了
I'll take that as a yes.

398
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,670
等一下
Wait.

399
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,810
- 好像是直升机  - 我们不就是为此来的吗
- Sounds like a helicopter. - Isn't that what we want?

400
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,110
是的 但我还没动手偷呢

你说你会告诉我什么时候该惊慌

- 实际上他们是来抓我的  - 什么

Reese先生 去这栋楼西北角
Mr. Reese, make your way to the freight elevator

413
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,850

一直往下坐到负4楼停车场

417
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,230

00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,370
好的
Okay.

他们不是来找Turing的

他们想抓那个射手 我们得干掉他们两个

我们能怎么干掉他们
How the hell are we gonna take them out

429
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,540
头上可有FBI在啊
with the feds on top of us?

430
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,870
我们有内线
We got a guy on the inside

431
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,370
会告诉我们他们的位置
that's going to feed us their location,

432
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,740
并且搞定监控录像
take care of the cameras.

433

FBI以为他在挟持Turing当人质

他是个特种部队出身的疯子

够挖出一个前往天朝的洞了

440
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:48,060

Ms. Morgan, any luck finding the person

442

还没有呢 但是我追踪到了Hans Friedrickson的助手

发现他其实出差去了

446
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,380
就快找到了
About to find out.

447
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,080
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

448

Sure, we can talk.

449

我追踪了你的电话
I traced your cell phone.

450
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,420
然后发现一件事
And here's the thing, Hans.

00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,920
你的手机注册在一个叫Jimmy White的流氓名下

通过最低生活保障金 骗点小钱

453
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,200
不过说真的 你装检察官
But I got to say,impersonating a prosecutor?

454
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,770
真是装的不怎么样
That's probably not your best play.

455
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,000
就是个临时工作啊
It was just a gig.

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,240
他们逼我假扮什么叫Hans的人
They forced me to pretend I was this Hans guy,

457
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,510
去威胁某个精神科医生
threaten some shrink.

458
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,010
谁逼你
Who forced you?

459
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,280
我不知道
I don't know.

460
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,780
我发誓真的不知道 都是用email联系我的
I swear I don't know.It was all over email.

461
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,280
他们
They were...

462
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,680
敲诈我
Blackmailing me.

463
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,250
他们什么都知道
They knew everything.

464
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,340
我们到电梯了 Finch
We made it to the elevator,Finch.

465
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,310
很高兴听到这个消息
Glad to hear it.

466
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,480
我到位时会通知你
I'll contact you when I'm in position.

467
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,780
Morgan女士
Ms. Morgan,

468
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,880
在寻找HR的雇主这件事上 我们有进展吗
are we any closer to identifying who hired HR?

469
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,020
没有 但有些事很不对劲
No, but something seems really off.

470
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,850
有人雇Hans去当Turing的病人
Someone paid Hans to become Turing's patient.

471
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,150
我正在去她的办公室
I'm going back to her office to see

472
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,690
看看能不能找到点别的线索
if I can dig up anything else.

473
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,690
还有 Harold
And, Harold,

474
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,360
万事小心
be careful.

475
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,760
我不希望我们共同的朋友发生任何事
I'd hate for anything to happen to our mutual friend.

476
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,670
听到说 他们在货运电梯里
Got word they're on the freight elevator.

477
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,740
你可以在25楼截住他们
You can cut them off on 25.

478
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,330
HR在25层，快出电梯 ――Carter

479
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,120
你在干什么
what are we doing?

480
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,390
他们按了下一层的电梯键
They hit the button on the floor below us.

481
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,060
是要杀你的那帮人
The guys who were trying to kill you

482
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,630
还是要杀我的那帮人
or the guys who were trying to kill me?

483
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,130
把火警安全面板打开
Open the fire safety panel.

484
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,030
想办法让线路短路 一直到超载灯亮起来
Try shorting the wires till the override light comes on.

485
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,400
然后我们就能避开下一层
Then we can bypass the floor below.

486
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,770
他们把电梯停在了26楼
They stopped the elevator at 26.

487
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,300
把家伙安到楼梯井里 除掉他们
Set your charges in the stairwell, and get rid of them.

488
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,810
行动

489
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,840
我觉得我该向你道歉
I think I owe you an apology.

490
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,080
怎么说
How do you figure?

491
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,250
我本来给你的诊断是妄想症
I diagnosed you as paranoid.

492
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,580
仅仅因为你有妄想症
Just because you're paranoid

493
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,720
不意味着他们就不会来杀你
doesn't mean they're not trying to kill you.

494
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,490
我找不到正确的线路
I can't find the right wire.

495
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,490
没有作用啊
It's not working.

496
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,670
找到了
Got him.

497
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,700
让小组守住27楼
Tell the teams to stage off 27.

498
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,870
通过楼梯井B进入26楼
Enter 26 through stairwell B.

499
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,610
遵命长官
Yes, sir.

500
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,540
FBI在27层 ――Carter

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,810
FBI逼近了

502
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,820
- 你们在哪了  - 已经可以撤退了 老大
- Where are we at, guys?  - We are good to go, boss.

503
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,790
好的 听我的命令行动
All right, you move in on my mark.

504
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,700
来抓你了 ――Carter

505
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,460
没时间了
we're out of time.

506
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,930
躲在我背后 我会尽力拖住他们
Just stay behind me, and I'll hold them off as long as I can.

507
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,970
行动
Do it.

508
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,270
准备行动
Get ready to move.

509
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,640
他有武器 但我希望尽量抓活的
He's armed, but I want him taken alive, if possible.

510
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,210
懂了吗
Understood?

511
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,480
但我会给你命令的
But I'll give you the signal.

512
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,180
就等你的命令了 Simmons
On your count, Simmons.

513
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,220
Five...
5

514
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,420
情况紧急 Harold
In a bit of a bind, Harold.

515
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,420
Four...
4

516
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,460
希望你还留了点看家本事
Hope you've got some tricks left up your sleeve.

517
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
一两招吧
One or two.

518
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,800
Three...
3

519
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,670
Two...
2

520
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,640
行动 就现在
Move in, team, now.

521
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,670
上
Go.

522
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,710
- 你听见我说话了吗  - Simmons
- Do you hear me?  - Simmons?

523
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,150
小队 快行动
Team, move in.

524
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,280
小组 马上行动 你们要错过目标了
Team, move now,you're gonna lose them.

525
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,550
TM发生什么事了
The hell's going on?

526
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,650
长官 联系中断了
Uh, sir, comms are down.

527
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,890
- 哪条线的联系  - 所有的
- Which comms?  - All of them.

528
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,920
线路中断了
Line's dead.

529
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,060
找到了
Got it.

530
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,430
到底TM发生了什么
What the hell's happening?

531
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,900
Canal街以南的信号塔全都挂了
Uh, every cell tower south of Canal Street just went out.

532
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,070
为了预备紧急情况 控制信号设施
DHS had a failsafe in place to take control

533
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,570
系统本来设置了故障保险的
of the cell infrastructure in case of an emergency.

534
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,410
有人黑进去了
Someone hacked it.

535
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,110
这些信号塔属于限定权限设施
The towers are white-listed.

536
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,010
要用授权码才能使用的
Only authorized numbers can use them.

537
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,110
这样的话 就只有一个号码
In this case, only one number.

538
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,380
谁的号码
Whose number?

539
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,050
我相信你还能听见我说话 Reese先生
I trust you can still hear me,Mr. Reese?

540
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,720
我得说Harold
I have to say, Harold,

541
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,860
我们都一起工作这么长时间了
we've been working together for some time now,

542
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,590
你却总能给我惊喜
but you continue to surprise me.

543
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,090
彼此彼此 Reese先生
Likewise, Mr. Reese.

544
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,330
你现在应该有着相当大的优势
You should have something of a competitive advantage now.

545
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,200
快用有线联系行动小组啊 靠
Just get the team on a hard line now, damn it.

546
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,800
等下 这家伙在干什么
Wait, what's this guy doing?

547
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,510
好 我们现在就到那去
All right, we're going down there now.

548
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,680
行动
Let's move.

549
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,350
谢了 Carter
Thanks for the help, Carter.

550
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,290
有人把你的行踪透露给HR的手下
Someone's feeding HR intel about your whereabouts.

551
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,520
不过我会处理好的
I'm gonna take care of it though.

552
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,160
Pearl街上没有警察
There are no units on Pearl Street.

553
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,300
你们可以从那里偷偷出来
You can smuggle them out there.

554
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,430
怎么了 Carter
What the hell, Carter?

555
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,970
把手机举起来给我
Hang up the phone and hand it to me.

556
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,200
快点 出来
Come on, come out of there.

557
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,270
这是怎么了 是一种误会吧
What's this about? Some type of misunderstanding?

558
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,940
不 我什么都知道了
No, I understand things perfectly.

559
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,680
你为HR工作
You're working for HR.

560
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,310
- 你在和谁打电话  - 关你什么事
- Who were you talking to? - None of your business.

561
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,350
你TMD想干嘛
What the hell do you think you're doing?

562
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,550
HR 你在泄密给他们
HR. You're guiding them.

563
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,680
你就是他们的耳目
You're their eyes and ears.

564
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,620
听着 Carter
Listen, Carter.

565
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,490
我是在HR卧底的 不是为他们工作
I'm working undercover in HR, not for them.

566
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,920
那是联邦调查局吗 还是联邦劳工局 给我看看你的文件 Fusco
The feds? IAB? Show me some paperwork, Fusco.

567
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,190
不是这样的 和官方的人无关
It's nothing like that. Nothing official.

568
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,700
听着 我做错了一些事 一些大事
Listen, I made some mistakes. Some big ones.

569
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,430
但现在不同了
But things are different now.

570
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,070
我在帮助别人 你必须相信我
I'm helping people. You got to trust me.

571
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,540
我现在就要知道怎么回事
I want answers. Now.

572
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,450
- 是那个西装男  - 你说什么
- The guy in the suit. - What did you say?

573
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,210
是你以前追踪过的西装男
The guy in the suit, the one you've been chasing.

574
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,180
我知道这听起来很疯狂
Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy,

575
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,190
但他们知道谁遇到了困难
but they seem to know when people are in trouble.

576
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,390
然后他们就帮助别人 他和另一个人
And they help them. Him and another guy.

577
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,090
有的时候我也会参与
And me too sometimes.

578
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,900
你说的另一个人 描述一下
This other guy. Describe him.

579
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,430
他像一个教授 他带着眼镜
He's like a professor. He's got the glasses

580
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,270
讲话文绉绉的
and a high-dollar vocabulary.

581
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,930
你进来前我就在和他打电话
That's who I was talking to when you came in.

582
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,210
你得跟我解释清楚 Finch
You got some explaining to do, Finch.

583
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,440
你好 警探
Hello, Detectives.

584
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,010
我理解你此刻有着一些问题
I understand you'll have some questions,

585
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,350
但我们现在没有时间了
but we're somewhat short of time.

586
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,110
我正在前往市中心 去帮助我们的朋友
I'm heading downtown to help our friend.

587
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,750
我建议你们也赶快去
I suggest you do the same thing.

588
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,050
John此刻就需要你们的帮助
John will almost certainly need your help.

589
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,930
你个贱人
You son of a bitch.

590
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,330
如果你不是内鬼 那是谁
If you're not the mole, then who is?

591
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,830
我很清楚内鬼是谁
I know exactly who the mole is.

592
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,170
我认识HR里的所有人
I know everyone who's in HR.

593
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,700
等我们处理完这件事 就把HR处理掉
When we get done with this, we're gonna take them all down.

594
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,850
现在怎么办
What now?

595
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,650
这里是旧维修通道
Old service tunnel down here

596
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,790
我们可以从这里出去
we can take outside the perimeter.

597
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:38,520
我的朋友在那里接应
My friend's meeting us there.

598
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,800
稍等一下
Hold on a second.

599
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,460
Reese先生 我就位了
Mr. Reese, I'm in position.

600
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,430
出去之后是一个污水处理厂
This comes out to a water treatment plant

601
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,300
在河旁边
by the river.

602
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,070
一直走就能碰到我的朋友
Keep going till you find my friend.

603
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,970
- 再见了  - 我会拖延他们 快走
- Split up. - I'll hold them off. Go.

604
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,080
谢谢你 John
John, thank you.

605
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,080
Turing正在去你那里
Turing's on her way to you.

606
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,130
我想我可能要晚点过去了
And I think I'm gonna be a little held up.

607
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,960
等我把Turing小姐送到安全地点
I'll get Ms. Turing to safety,

608
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,230
我就回来找你 John
and I'll come back for you, John.

609
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,710
Harold Finch 是吗
Harold Finch, I presume.

610
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,990
你真难找啊 Harold
You're a hard man to find, Harold.

611
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,160
- 我不知道你是  - 得了吧
- I don't know who you-- - Save it.

612
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,090
你以前见过我 记得吗
We met before, remember?

613
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,700
Nathan说你是他的IT技术人员
Nathan introduced you as his IT guy.

614
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,530
他还真是轻描淡写
He always had a talent for understatement.

615
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,640
你想从我这里得到什么 Alicia
What do you want from me, Alicia?

616
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,670
没什么
Nothing complicated.

617
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,740
你创造了上帝
You created God.

618
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,480
而现在 你要帮我把它关掉
And now you're gonna help me shut it down.

619
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,130
好了 前进 前进
All right, go, go, go!

620
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,830
朋友 看上去你快要挂了
Looks like you're just about out of time, my friend.

621
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,170
只是快要而已
Just about.

622
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,750
快进来
Get in!

623
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,180
进车里去
Get to the car!

624
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,330
在Nathan死之前
Before Nathan died,

625
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,670
在你建造的机器杀死他之前
before your machine killed him,

626
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,940
我知道有些东西正在蚕食他
I could tell something was eating away at him,

627
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,040
所建立的道德体系
the ethics of what he was building.

628
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,180
我还以为他是在和自己对抗
I thought he was fighting with himself over it.

629
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,380
原来他在和你对抗
But he was fighting with you.

630
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,180
他知道的 不是吗
He knew, didn't he?

631
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,590
创造出强大的机器所带来的傲慢感
The hubris of creating something as powerful as the machine.

632
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,330
我现在就能感受到
I can feel it right now.

633
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,370
监视着我们 监听着我们
Watching us, listening to us.

634
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:23,940
我们在此无处可藏
There's no hiding from it.

635
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,070
我逃的太累了
I'm so tired of running.

636
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,180
我做错了一些事
I've made some mistakes.

637
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,280
但不包括建造机器这件事
But building the machine is not one of them.

638
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,990
你没有在逃避机器 Alicia
You haven't been running from the machine, Alicia,

639
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,660
机器也没有杀死Nathan
and the machine didn't kill Nathan.

640
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,230
你在逃避人们
You've been running from people.

641
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,100
逃避我们都信任的人
From people that you and I both trusted.

642
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,630
没错
You're right.

643
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,800
很幸运的是我先找到了你
And you're lucky I found you first.

644
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,390
为什么不告诉我们 我们都为你工作
Why didn't you tell us we were both working with you?

645
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,020
- 为了保护你们 - 保护我们吗
- To protect you. - Protect us?

646
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,490
你差点让我被杀了
You almost got me killed.

647
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,560
你不相信我们 我们怎能相信你呢
You can't trust us, how are we supposed to trust you?

648
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,830
信任是一件很复杂的事情 Lionel
Trust is complicated, Lionel.

649
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,700
比如说 我坐在一辆警车里
For example, I'm sitting in a police car

650
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,240
其中一个警察想谋杀我
with one cop who tried to murder me

651
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,010
另一个花了六个月想把我抓起来
and another who spent six months trying to lock me up.

652
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,580
所以你们应该能原谅我 没有一下子都告诉你们
So you'll forgive me if I take things one step at a time.

653
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,190
减速吧 Carter
Slow down, Carter.

654
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,420
减速吗 那两个人知道
Slow down? These two know

655
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,690
他们就要完蛋了
they're going down for life.

656
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,560
他们会杀掉所有妨碍他们的人
They'll kill anybody who gets in their way.

657
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,930
我来对付他们
I got this.

658
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,530
相信我
Trust me.

659
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,650
我们得选个时间一起庆祝一下
Well, we should all grab a drink together sometime.

660
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,150
我请客
My treat.

661
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,590
你知道那些不法之人会对你干什么吗
Do you have any idea what the wrong person would do to you

662
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,720
一旦他们发现了你有访问权限
if they knew you had access?

663
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,130
知道你能造出多大的混乱
What kind of chaos that could create?

664
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,600
定义一下 不法之人
Define "wrong person."

665
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,730
你花钱让腐败的警察
You were willing to pay corrupt police officers

666
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,540
杀一个无辜的女人 把我引出来
to target an innocent woman just to draw me out.

667
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,240
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

668
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,740
那台机器 你知道它是怎么运行的
The machine, you know how it works.

669
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,140
无关的名单
The irrelevant list.

670
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,040
你知道一旦你让Turing陷入危险
You knew it would send us Turing's name

671
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
机器就会把她的号码给我
if you put her in danger.

672
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,050
无关的名单吗
Irrelevant list?

673
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,120
我不需要来引你出来
I didn't need to lure you out.

674
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,380
我跟踪了你几个星期了
I've been following you for weeks.

675
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,260
我觉得她永远没法闭上嘴巴
I thought she'd never shut up.

676
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,140
很高兴终于认识你了 Harold
So nice to finally meet you, Harold.

677
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,240
你可以叫我Root
You can call me Root.

678
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,820
你被陷害了 John
You were set up, John.

679
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,350
Turing不是你所想象的人
Turing isn't who we think she is.

680
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,020
- 你说什么 - 她的办公室
- What do you mean? - Her office,

681
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,550
她的一生 都是个假象
her life, it's all a mirage.

682
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,520
我看到了转账记录
I saw the escrow transfer.

683
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,730
她就是买通HR的人
She was the one who paid HR.

684
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,590
她让HR来杀她自己
She put the hit on herself.

685
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,360
Turing一定对你们了如指掌
Turing must've learned how you operate,

686
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,600
你们会在她遇到危险的时候出现
that you'd show up if her life was in danger.

687
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
她引诱你去找她
She was trying to lure you out into the open.

688
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,770
她不是在找我
She wasn't looking for me.

689
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,970
她是在找Finch
She was looking for him.

690
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,070
你自己雇佣的HR
You hired HR yourself.

691
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,580
你冒着生命危险来寻找我吗
You were willing to risk your own life to find me?

692
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,050
我参加过一次这样的企业培训
I did this corporate training thing once.

693
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,250
当时我是去绑架一个CEO的 但这是后话了
I was blackmailing the CEO, long story,

694
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,290
他们组织了一个叫做信任背摔的训练
but they did this exercise called the trust fall,

695
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,590
让你闭上眼睛 然后向后倒
where you close your eyes and fall...

696
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:59,000
等着别人来接住你
And wait for someone to catch you.

697
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,530
我知道你们会来接住我的
I knew you boys wouldn't let me down.

698
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,200
来吧 Harold
Come on, Harold.

699
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,370
我们有太多东西得一起聊聊了
We've got so much to talk about.

700
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,070
匿名邮件

701
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:08,580
他现在陷入危险了 因为他在为你工作
He's in danger now because he was working for you.

702
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:16,360
所以我需要你帮我把他找回来
So you're gonna help me get him back.

703
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,520
评价中
运作连续性受到破坏
