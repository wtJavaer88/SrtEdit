1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,980
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,040
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,840
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,000
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,360
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,210
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,000
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,730
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,850
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,640
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,220
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,760
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,550
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,820
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,500
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,280
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
If you're number's up, we'll find you.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,000
<font color="#4096d1">疑犯追踪 第1季 第12集</font>
<font color="#4096d1">Person of Interest S01E12 720p HDTV x264</font>

18
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,540
咖啡要凉了哦  警探
Your coffee's getting cold, detective.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,690
西装不错
Nice suit.

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,160
你终于找到我了
You finally found me.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,440
我却没听到警笛
but I don't hear any sirens

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,390
你也没用枪指着我
or see you reaching for your gun.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,430
我在找"不好意思害你中枪了"道歉卡
I looked for a "I'm sorry I got you shot" Card,

24
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,490
结果身上没有了
but they were all out.

25
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,400
我不知道斯诺会做出这种事
I had no idea what Snow was capable of...

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,790
他真的是想杀你
that he'd actually try to kill you.

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,410
为什么联系我  卡特
Why did you contact me, Carter?

28
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,080
我有一肚子问题
Got a lot of questions.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,780
你甩掉了你的跟屁虫
Well, you managed to lose your tail.

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,200
干得不错
That's quite a feat.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,120
那些中情局的小子花了不少时间
Those CIA boys spend a lot of time

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,470
学会如何隐匿踪迹
learning how to be invisible.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,840
你觉得就斯诺一个人盯着我吗
Think Snow is my only problem?

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,540
还有连我都不知道的特工
Is there another agency following you

35
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,590
跟着你吗
that I'm not aware of?

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,840
你屁股后面跟着整个
You've got an entire NYPD

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,790
纽约警局的特别小组
task force looking for you.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,460
我闯了两个红灯跑过来
Had to run two lights getting here

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,210
就为了躲开我自己同事的跟踪
just to make sure my own people weren't trailing me.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,930
我是个警察  警察有警察的规矩
I'm a cop, which means I've got rules.

41
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,840
不能破坏的规矩
Rules that can't be broken.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,110
但是...我还是想知道内情
But, um... I want to know more.

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,840
踏上这条路
Once you go down that road...

44
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,210
你就不能再回头了
There's no looking back.

45
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,040
你怎么得到的那些信息
How are you getting your information?

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,150
我只能告诉你  我们能知道有人有危机
All I can tell you is we hear about people in danger.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,330
或是有人在制造危机
or people who are causing it.

48
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,530
为什么告诉我
Why me?

49
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,750
因为你的道德观指向正确的方向
Because your moral compass is pointed in the right direction.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,150
因为我被你追烦了
Because I'm tired of you chasing me.

51
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,670
接下来怎么做
How does this work?

52
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,150
安卓娅・古特雷斯
Andrea Gutierrez?

53
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,400
青少年时期有过保密犯罪记录的民事诉讼律师
Civil litigation attorney with a sealed juvie record.

54
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,420
我要看她的档案  卡特
I need it unsealed, Carter.

55
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,020
我刚说过规矩
What did I just say about rules?

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,410
你有你的规矩
You have your rules...

57
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,660
也有机会救人
and you have the chance to save a life.

58
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,690
选择在你
It's your choice.

59
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,540
等你联系
I'll be in touch.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,730
你看起来很担心  芬奇
You look worried, Finch.

61
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,950
你的裁缝搬出城了吗
Did your tailor move out of the city?

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,120
和卡特警探的早饭吃得怎么样
How was your breakfast meeting with detective Carter?

63
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,380
你都听到了
You heard her.

64
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,890
她想知道咱们的信息是从哪来
She wants to know how we get our information.

65
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,650
绝不能告诉她机器的事
She can never know about the machine.

66
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,600
我觉得就算说了她也不一定信
I doubt if she'd believe it if I told her.

67
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,040
她倒是同意了给我们看安卓娅・古特雷斯的档案
She did agree to get us Andrea Gutierrez's juvie file.

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,990
不错  这是个正确方向的开端
Well, that's a step in the right direction.

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,040
你还发现了这位律师什么信息
What else did you find out about our lawyer?

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
安卓娅・古特雷斯  在皇后区出生长大

71

00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,120
在纽约州立大学和皇后学院法学院读书
Then SUNY New Paltz and Queens college law

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,090
学习民事诉讼
where she studied civil litigation.

75
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,310
她很有上进心
She's a scrapper.

76
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,950
野心勃勃
Ambitious.

77
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,680
一心想过更好的生活
Just trying to make a better life for herself.

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,770
是的  但更好的生活代价也很高
Yes, but a better life can be expensive.

79
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,010
她欠了五万美元的助学贷款
She owes $50,000 in student loans...

80
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,990
信用卡还透支了两万
And another $20,000 on her credit cards.

81
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,320
很大一笔债啊
That's a lot of debt.

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,440
也许她管错误的人借了钱
Maybe she borrowed money from the wrong person.

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,110
有可能  她在生意上也欠着钱
It's possible; she owes money on her business, too.

84
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,260
看这个
Hey, watch it.

85
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,110
最近她正在为那些
Apparently she's trying to carve out a niche for herself

86
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,000
愤恨的罪犯和前科犯辩护
by suing the state on behalf of inmates and ex-cons

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,950
为自己的事业打下基础
with grievances from their stay behind bars.

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,010
那她的情况如何
How's that working out for her?

89
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,620
零胜诉六败诉
She's 0-for-6.

90
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,580
估计她希望最近的案子能交上好运
I imagine she hopes her current case will be lucky number seven.

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,730
反对  法官大人
Objection, your honor.

92
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,080
这些证据之间有关联吗
Relevance of this testimony?

93
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,700
法官大人  我只是想证实
Your honor, I'm just trying to prove

94
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,850
我的委托人唯一的过失
my client's only wrongdoing

95
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,950
是没把他的公寓收拾干净

96
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,700
这毒品很旧  上面都是灰
The drugs were old, dusty,

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,660
说明是金先生戒毒以前的
from the days before Mr. King was clean.

98
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,370
反对  古特雷斯女士这算是在举证吗
Objection. Is Ms. Gutierrez testifying now?

99
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,040
奥康纳法官  这个案子毫无根据
Judge O'connor, this case is baseless,

100
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,300
就像之前古特雷斯女士呈上庭的
just like every other ex-con nuisance case

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,250
所有令人厌恶的前科犯案子一样
ms. Gutierrez has brought before this court.

102
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,000
我们作为公诉人   要求一个公正的判决
And we, the state, ask you to treat it as such.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,970
-得了吧你  -古特雷斯女士
- Give me a break. - Ms. Gutierrez.

104
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,920
十分抱歉  法官大人
I'm sorry, your honor.

105
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,760
我只是很难听进去公诉人的话
I just have a hard time taking the state seriously

106
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,260
因为他的领带实在太搞笑了
when it's wearing that tie.

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,350
休庭  等两位成熟点再继续审判
Let's adjourn while you two grow up.

108
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,480
请双方管照好自己的证人
Get your witnesses in order.

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,860
周五再次开庭审理
We'll reconvene on Friday.

110
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,740
我明天过来看你  我保证
I'll come see you tomorrow, I promise.

111
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,130
-你会带上雅各布吗  -当然
- And you'll bring Jacob? - You bet.

112
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,220
这样不对  安卓娅  我是说  我没...
This is so wrong. Andrea, I mean, I didn't...

113
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,530
我什么都没做
I didn't even do anything.

114
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,450
记住我说的话  不要和那些
Remember what I said about not communicating

115
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,860
法庭上的人说话  特伦斯
with anyone from the trial, Terrence?

116
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,150
他是...他是我的假释官
He's my-- he's my parole officer.

117
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,090
现在不行  他什么也不是
Not right now, he's not.

118
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,420
格鲁斯卡  我跟你说过那些毒品不是我的
Galuska, I told you those drugs weren't mine.

119
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,370
我是说  你还给我做过检测  为什么不相信我
I mean, you tested me, man. Why don't you believe me?

120
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,470
我只是尽我的职责  特伦斯
I just did my job, Terrence.

121
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,450
毒品在你家里  说明就是你的
Those drugs were in your place. That makes them yours.

122
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,980
你应该更小心
You should have been more careful.

123
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,470
感谢致电家庭事务部  我能为您做些什么
Thank you for calling dfs. How may I assist you?

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,060
拉巴超市的五香熏牛肉三明治
Pastrami from Zabar's?

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,950
-你肯定要使唤我了  -特伦斯・金的血检结果
- You must need something big. - Terrence King's blood test.

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,110
他被捕的时候假释官给他做过
His parole officer did one when he was arrested,

127
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,630
我要用它来证明他没在吸毒
and I need it to help me prove that he wasn't using.

128
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,160
-你向法庭提出申请了吗  -过去几周了  但...
- Did you put in a request? - Weeks ago, but...

129
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,980
我给你查查  小安
I'll look into it, Andi.

130
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,830
谢谢啦
Thank you.

131
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,050
你最好快走  老大来了
You better go. Boss lady's coming.

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,450
我以为你在午餐时间加班呢  克里斯
I thought you were working through lunch, Chris...

133
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,460
没想到是在开小差
Not entertaining visitors.

134
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,350
她就是来取个文件
She just came for a file.

135
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,810
你有相应的手续吗
Did you go through proper channels?

136
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,680
我有  格洛丽亚  我发誓
I did, Gloria, I swear.

137
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,940
但那些手续都太...太太慢了
But those channels are so freaking...Slow.

138
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,460
恭喜坡终于拿到了他的毕业文凭
All right, to Poe finally getting his diploma.

139
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,930
古特雷斯小姐回家了吗
Did ms. Gutierrez go home?

140
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,430
她和一些朋友在喝酒
She stopped for drinks with some friends.

141
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,450
我本来还担心你改主意了
I was worried you'd change your mind.

142
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,340
呵  暂时没有
Ha, not yet.

143
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,530
我拿到了安卓娅・古特雷斯的秘密档案
I've got your girl Andrea Gutierrez's juvie records.

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,030
典型的麻烦精  整个大学二年级麻烦不断
Teenage troublemaker, B&E her sophomore year,

145
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,030
还受到过一连串的盗窃起诉
and a string of larceny charges.

146
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,940
别挂  卡特
Hold on, carter.

147
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,940
-什么事  莱奈尔  -卡特有动作
- What is it, Lionel? - Carter's up to something.

148
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,200
你别顾头不顾腚
You need to watch your ass.

149
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,380
谢谢你这么关心我的腚  莱奈尔
I appreciate your concern about my ass, Lionel,

150
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,220
卡特警探的事我能自己处理好
But I can handle detective Carter.

151
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,500
我可告诉你  她在和什么人打电话
I'm telling you, she's talking to someone

152
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
鬼鬼祟祟压着声音
and keeping it on the down low,

153
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,260
她在调查什么事
Working something on her own.

154
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,510
我会留意
I'll keep that in mind.

155
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,880
还在吗  卡特
You still with me, Carter?

156
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,670
我还在
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm still with you.

157
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,920
我们现在该怎么做
So what do we do now?

158
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,020
静观其变
We'll watch and wait.

159
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,170
卡特
And Carter?

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,630
谢谢
Thanks.

161
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,240
里瑟  我不确定把那两个警探
Mr. Reese, I'm not sure that keeping both of our detectives

162
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,320
都蒙在鼓里是不是个好办法
in the dark is the best course of action.

163
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,740
情况会变得很复杂
This could get really complicated.

164
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,750
他们都很宝贵
They're assets.

165
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,380
他们对彼此了解的越少就越安全
The less they know about each other, the safer they'll be.

166
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,960
现在  我更担心古特雷斯小姐
Right now, I'm more concerned with Ms. Gutierrez.

167
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,140
芬奇  有人在跟踪她
Finch, someone's tailing our girl.

168
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,080
除你以外的人吗
Someone other than you?

169
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,060
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

170
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,480
里瑟先生  你还好吗
Mr. Reese, are you all right?

171
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,710
现在可希望那枪伤
Yeah, wishing gunshot wounds...

172
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,940
能痊愈得更快些了
healed faster right about now.

173
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,390
袭击者在用合成类固醇
Assailant's into anabolic steroids.

174
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,350
古特雷斯小姐呢
Where's Ms. Gutierrez?

175
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,670
她现在很安全
She's safe for now.

176
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,990
但是看那个人的身手
But with the way that guy handled himself,

177
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,370
我不确定以后会如何
I don't know for how much longer.

178
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,170
密码无效

179
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,740
知道是谁想杀害律师小姐吗
Any guesses about who'd want to kill our attorney?

180
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,450
昨晚袭击她的人
The guy who tried to attack her last night

181
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,600
看起来坐过牢
looked like he'd done time.

182
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,140
可能是愤怒的前委托人
Could be, uh, angry former client?

183
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,940
别盯着看
Excuse me.

184
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,800
我们得拿到她的档案
Well, we need to get her files.

185
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,930
看看攻击者是不是她的委托人
See if the assailant is one of her clients.

186
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,090
缩小嫌疑犯范围
Narrow down our suspects.

187
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,190
什么事
Yes?

188
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,260
我尽快赶过去
I'll be there as soon as I can.

189
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,330
请半天假吗  芬奇
Half day, Finch?

190
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,010
盯紧古特雷斯小姐
Stay close to Ms. Gutierrez.

191
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,090
我马上回来
I'll be back soon.

192
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,950
你终于减头发了
You cut your hair...finally.

193
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,660
你也终于换眼镜了
Got new glasses. Finally.

194
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,610
我想在开始教训你的地下赌博行径前
I suppose you could use some rest before I lecture you

195
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,790
你可以抓紧时间休息一下
on the perils of underground gambling.

196
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,870
那太好了  我快四十八小时没睡了
That'd be great. I've been up almost 48 hours.

197
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,210
我的狱友打呼噜像火车过境一样
My cellmate snored like a freight train.

198
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,420
很高兴你回家了  威尔
Happy you're home, Will.

199
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,540
抱歉又让你帮我保释
Sorry you had to bail me out again.

200
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,160
不管怎样  你回来了就好
Well, it's good to have you back either way.

201
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,160
你怎么神不知鬼不觉地潜入我办公室
How'd you get into my office without anyone noticing?

202
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,430
行业秘密
Trade secret.

203
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,830
我要你帮我查出
I need you to help me to find out

204
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,780
在哪可以买到那个牌子的类固醇
where to buy that brand of steroid.

205
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,450
怎么  你要锻炼肌肉吗
What, you looking to beef up?

206
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,900
它属于昨晚和我打过一场的家伙
It belonged to a guy I had a run-in with last night.

207
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,350
他很有技巧
Skilled fighter.

208
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,830
我想找出他活跃的那个健身房
Looking to track down the gym where he juices up.

209
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
你有别的想法吗
Are you having second thoughts?

210
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,210
只是办公室里的眼线比较多
There's just a lot of prying eyes around this place.

211
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,670
你也开始疑神疑鬼了呀  卡特
You're getting paranoid, Carter.

212
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,610
那就意味着你的方向正确了
That's a step in the right direction.

213
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,130
你想起诉你的老板
So you want to sue your boss.

214
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,350
很好  我们完全可以代理这个案子
Wonderful, uh... we can absolutely do that.

215
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,400
你做什么工作
Um, what, uh... what type of work do you do?

216
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,730
挺复杂
Uh, it's um, complicated.

217
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,770
你是怎么听说我的呢
Okay. How did you hear about me?

218
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,710
一个法警说对国家有抱怨的前科犯
A bailiff said ex-cons with gripes against the state

219
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,630
是你的专长
is your specialty.

220
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,370
-这是个不良信息嘛  -当然不是
- Is that bad information? - Um, no, not at all.

221
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,990
我以为这个是干净的民事案件
It's just I thought you were a clear-cut civil case.

222
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,370
我一直在找的理想对象
The unicorn I've been looking for...

223
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,840
比如完美男人
like the perfect man.

224
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,330
对不起  我今天笨手笨脚
Sorry, I'm all thumbs today.

225
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,680
我经常这么干  我马上回来
I do it all the time. I'll be right back.

226
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,420
漂亮  里瑟先生  有信号了
Nicely done, Mr. Reese. I have a signal now.

227
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,340
你的约会如何
How was your appointment?

228
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,480
很有效果  谢谢关心
Quite productive, thank you.

229
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,740
好了
Here we go.

230
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,160
告诉我  你为什么想起诉你老板
So, tell me, why do you want to sue your boss?

231
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,470
我的工作环境
Well, my working conditions are, um...

232
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,050
很不安全
unsafe.

233
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,670
我滑到了  伤了背
I slipped and hurt my back.

234
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,220
-是在工作时发生的吗  -就在昨晚
- Did that happen on the job? - Just last night, actually.

235
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,760
里瑟先生  两个话筒都有声音了
Mr. Reese, I've got sound in both microphones, now.

236
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,900
正在接通她的硬盘
Connecting to her hard drive.

237
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,710
我会发一封病毒邮件
I sent an email with a virus

238
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,380
伪装成布卢明代尔百货的任选六折优惠券
promising 40% off any purchase at Bloomingdales.

239
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,900
她肯定会下载
She couldn't resist downloading it.

240
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,550
你老板是什么样的人
So, what's this boss of yours like?

241
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,020
控制欲强  鬼鬼祟祟
Very manipulative. Secretive.

242
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,560
我们有些私人恩怨
We've had some personality conflicts.

243
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,680
我猜他很富有
I take it he has a lot of money.

244
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,400
他是那种独来独往的富翁
He's, uh, one of those rich loner types.

245
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,830
如果他不是这么有钱  肯定会被人当成怪胎
Kind you'd call strange if he didn't have so much cash.

246
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,170
所以他的话  是很古怪
So, instead, he's, uh, eccentric.

247
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,760
这个案子会占用很多时间
Well, this case is going to rack up a lot of hours.

248
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,930
我可以预付费用
I can pay upfront.

249
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,430
那我可以开始了
Then I can start immediately.

250
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,530
不过要在下个预约之后
Well, after my next appointment.

251
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,410
我要迟到了
I'm, uh, running late.

252
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,570
我会打给你
I'll call you.

253
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,040
我很期待
I look forward to it.

254
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,230
爸爸
Daddy!

255
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,750
他来了
There he is.

256
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,150
克里斯帮了我一个大忙
Chris did me a big favor by picking him up

257
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,370
把他从寄养家庭接了过来
from the foster family's place.

258
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,150
爸爸  你什么时候回家
When are you coming home, daddy?

259
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,990
我不喜欢我的房间
I don't like my room.

260
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,150
安卓娅会帮我出去
Andrea's gonna get me out of here

261
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,200
比你想象的还要快
sooner than you know it, all right?

262
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,230
没错  小家伙
That's right, buddy.

263
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,970
雅各布  先去那边
Yeah, Jacob, why don't you go over there right now,

264
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,800
和克里斯玩一会怎么样
hang with Chris for a minute.

265
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,990
让我和安卓娅谈完
And let me finish talking with Andrea?

266
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,470
你拿到了血液测试报告吗
So, um, so did you get the blood test?

267
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,760
我拜托克里斯了  但就算我们拿到了
Chris is working on it, but even if we get it--

268
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,060
他们还是在我房间里发现了毒品
Right. They still found the drugs in my house.

269
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,310
也许我们可以让你在独立实验室做测试
Maybe we can get you tested at an independent lab

270
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,300
证明你的清白  这很可行
and prove that you were clean. It could help.

271
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,930
不管你需要什么  我都会做
Whatever you need, I'll do it.

272
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,150
我知道我不能付你钱
Look, I know I can't pay you

273
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,490
我也知道没什么希望  但是...
and I know that it's not looking good, but...

274
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,420
谢谢你
Thank you.

275
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,230
每个人都该有第二次机会
Everyone deserves a second chance.

276
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,380
你有发现了
You've found something.

277
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,330
品牌名是康复龙

278
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,990
是种在综合格斗健身房很流行的混合物
It's a popular compound found in some MMA gyms.

279
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,130
在纽约有三个健身房销售

280
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,650
地址是什么
What are the locations?

281
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,210
你要保证不搞出乱子
I'll tell you only if I don't wind up

282
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,400
我就告诉你  明白吗
getting called to a crime scene, understood?

283
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,970
向你保证  警探
You have my word, detective.

284
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,490
看到袭击者了吗
Any sign of our assailant?

285
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,520
三个地点都没有
Third location, and still nothing.

286
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,590
可能昨晚的那位朋友
Could be our friend from last night

287
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,520
决定休息一天
decided to take the day off.

288
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,450
芬奇  我看到他了

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,330
还记得我吗
Hey, you remember me?

290
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,900
小心
Look out!

291
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,120
里瑟  你还好吗
Reese, are you okay?

292
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,950
还好  但那家伙就没这么好了
Yes, but I can't say the same about the other guy.

293
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,210
看来我得食言了
So much for not dropping any bodies.

294
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,990
死者名叫阿隆索・加西亚
Our dearly departed hit man, Alonso Garcia,

295
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,560

299
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,130
但安卓娅不是他的代理律师
But Andrea wasn't his representative.

300
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,430
那他们之间有什么联系
Then what's their connection?

301
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,630
特伦斯・金
Terrence King.

302
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,870
他们的假释官都是道米尼克・格鲁斯卡
They share a parole officer named Dominic Galuska.

303
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,900
对  我在法院见过他
Yeah, saw him at the courthouse.

304
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,620
也许我该去拜访一下格鲁斯卡先生
Maybe I should pay Mr. Galuska a visit,

305
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,020
看看这是不是单纯的巧合
see if this is more than just a coincidence.

306
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,640
我知道你想说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

307
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,610
我给了你地址  你跟我保证
I give you an address, and you promised me

308
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,000
不会出人命  结果呢
no one would get dead, and what happens?

309
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,500
这我要自辩一下  加西亚先生
In my defense, Mr. Garcia didn't look both ways

310
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,820
过马路前没有朝两边看
before crossing the street.

311
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,570
你怎么知道死者的名字
How did you know the dead guy's name?

312
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,540
我们还没确认他的身份
We couldn't find any I.D. on him.

313
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,460
在他的驾照上写着
It was on his driver's license.

314
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,460
你偷了死人的钱包
You stole a dead guy's wallet?

315
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,210
他昨晚想杀了安卓娅・古特雷斯
He tried to kill Andrea Gutierrez last night,

316
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,470
他还会再下杀手
and he was going to try again.

317
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,760
加西亚手头有多少钱  1万吗
Garcia had just under, what, 10 grand on him?

318
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,230
我猜是杀手赏金
My guess, it's a payoff for a hit.

319
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,530
谁想杀她
Who'd want to kill her?

320
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,610
正在查
I'm working on it.

321
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,710
我这个月没钱付给你  格鲁斯卡
I can't pay you this month, Galuska.

322
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,980
要是我收不到钱
If I don't get my cut,

323
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,700
我保证会找到一堆违反假释的地方
I bet I could find a dozen parole violations,

324
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,390
再把你扔进去
throw you back inside.

325
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,400
这是10%  行了吧
That's 10%, okay?

326
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,910
我给你这份工作的时候
When I got you this job,

327
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,860
说好要薪水的30%
our deal was 30% of your paycheck.

328
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,290
别想占我便宜  卢
Don't you cheap out on me, Lou.

329
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,950
道米尼克
Hey, Dominic!

330
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,350
我的钱呢
Where's my money?

331
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,830
你以为自己在跟谁说话
Who do you think you're talking to?

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,700
我想我在跟一个勒索假释犯
I thought I was talking to the guy who's shaking down

333
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,660
合法收入的人说话
his parolees for their legit pay.

334
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,100
看看能不能帮我
See if you can find me

335
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,640
找瓶酒过来  好吗
a bottle of booze in there, will you?

336
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,670
-谢了  -911  有什么紧急状况
- Thank you. - 911, state your emergency.

337
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,900
我叫道米尼克・格鲁斯卡
My name is Dominic Galuska,

338
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,450
我对自己和他人都是个祸害
and I may be a danger to myself and others.

339
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,690
旧阁楼
Wow, the old loft.

340
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,740
是啊  葬礼之后就没来过这儿了
Yeah, haven't been here since the funeral.

341
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,830
我想着你也许哪天会回来
I thought you might come back to it someday.

342
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,980
我把一些东西打包放到仓库了
I'm packing some stuff up to send to storage.

343
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,570
要是你对什么东西有兴趣  告诉我
If there's anything that you're interested in, let me know.

344
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,290
谢谢  你考虑留下吗
Thanks. You thinking about staying?

345
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,010
不  我在考虑卖掉这里
No, I'm thinking about selling the place.

346
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,580
一直不太喜欢这儿
Never really liked it much here.

347
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,950
他离婚后就搬来这里了
It's where he moved after the divorce.

348
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,570
看起来总是很大  很贵  很空
Always seemed too big... expensive...vacant.

349
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,310
他忙于工作
Well, he worked a lot.

350
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,670
我大概知道你的想法
Guess I can see how you might think that.

351
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,060
抱歉  我忘了问
Sorry, I forgot to ask--

352
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,420
保险生意怎么样
How's the insurance business going?

353
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,280
无聊依旧  谢谢
Boring as ever, thank you.

354
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,270
你有没有全部翻看过
Have you had a chance to go through everything?

355
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,300
原来我爸有点收藏癖
It turns out dad was a bit of a pack rat.

356
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,270
好像有一半是我的东西
It looks like half of it's mine.

357
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,640
项目企划  各种奖项  大学论文
Projects, awards, papers from school.

358
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,580
你一直是优秀学生
Well, you always were an outstanding student.

359
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,840
有没有想过完成住院医师实习期
Have you thought about finishing your residency?

360
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,360
不了  全世界到处是
No, got plenty of action

361
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,500
无国界医生组织  红十字会之类的活动
around the world with MSF, Red Cross.

362
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,860
感觉不到我在帮助别人
Didn't feel like I was helping people.

363
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,850
你是医生  你的工作就是帮助别人
You're a doctor. All you do is help people.

364
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,430
我只是在治疗既成事实的病症
I treat symptoms of the disease after the fact,

365
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,870
而不是根源
never the underlying cause.

366
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,850
我想要真正地帮助别人
I want to really help people.

367
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,990
我在想  你多像你父亲啊
I was just thinking how much you sound like your father.

368
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,360
是啊
Yeah.

369
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,690
我能说服你留下吗
Any chance I can convince you to stay?

370
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,150
抱歉
Sorry.

371
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,980
不要不告而别
Well, don't leave without saying good-bye.

372
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,780
不会的
I won't.

373
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,040
你陷害格鲁斯卡说他威胁
You framed Galuska for making a death threat

374
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,500
要杀了他手下的假释犯
against one of his parolees?

375
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,730
是你说需要证据
You said you needed evidence.

376
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,000
不是这种
Not like that.

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,470
卡特  如果你不想审问他
If you don't wanna interrogate him, Carter,

378
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,200
我很乐意代劳
I'd be happy to do it for you.

379
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,640
他已是笼中鸟了
He's already in the box.

380
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,470
很好  我们要查出他是否有同谋
Good, we need to find out if he's working with anyone.

381
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,690
看他有没有派别人去杀安卓娅
See if he's sent anyone else after Andrea.

382
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
我自己的工作自己会做  谢了
I know how to do my job, thank you.

383
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,300
不过我确实发现了格鲁斯卡有点问题
But I did find something interesting about Galuska.

384
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,320
他有几个假释犯被送回牢中
Several of his parolees that got sent back inside

385
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,570
一直在控诉是被他陷害
complained about him setting them up.

386
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,860
说格鲁斯卡仿造证据
Said Galuska planted evidence on them.

387
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,380
他怎么脱的身
What does he get out of it?

388
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,710
我去查查
I'm gonna find that out.

389
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,470
还有  能不能拜托你别再违法了
In the meantime, can you try not to break any more laws?

390
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,100
你好  莱奈尔  想我了吗
Hello, Lionel, miss me?

391
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,710
没错  想得头都痛
Yeah, like I miss a hangover.

392
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,560
-有个任务给你  -是卡特吗
- I've got a job for you. - This about Carter?

393
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,390
她还是表现得很诡异
Because she's still acting all hinky.

394
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,710
不是  我现在担心的不是卡特
No, it's not Carter I'm concerned about right now.

395
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,990
是别人
It's someone else.

396
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,410
好吧  什么任务
All right, what's this job?

397
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,630
"倾心"相亲网

398
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,630
约翰
John?

399
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,870
我们有约吗
Do we have an appointment?

400
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,310
没有  但我有个问题
No, but I have a question.

401
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,560
我刚被指定了一个新假释官
I was just assigned a new P.O.

402
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,310
他这人挺难搞
He's being difficult.

403
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,680
叫道米尼克・格鲁斯卡
His name's Dominic Galuska.

404
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,740
我认识这家伙  绝对的混蛋
I know that guy. Total jackass.

405
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,130
他总是搜查我的公寓
He keeps searching my apartment,

406
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,500
根本没什么东西  但他一来再来
and there's nothing to find, but he keeps coming back.

407
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,910
如果他再出现  打电话给我
If he shows up again, call me.

408
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,690
不管是白天晚上  我都会过去
I'll be there, anytime of the day or night.

409
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,800
当然是指工作时间
On the clock, of course.

410
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,490
那网站有用吗
How's that site working out for you?

411
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,460
我这行比较难找到合适的人
It's hard to find the right kind of guy in my line of work.

412
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,810
不可能吧  你那么有魅力  又聪明
That seems odd, because you're very attractive, smart...

413
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,130
我们打住吧  约翰
Let me stop you there, John.

414
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,180
我不跟委托人和前科犯约会
I don't date my clients or ex-cons.

415
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,270
试过  够了
Been there, done that.

416
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,530
你现在看到的是新版安卓娅
This is Andrea 2.0 you're looking at.

417
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,160
此外  我想你付钱
Plus, I need your money.

418
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,900
而且  我喜欢我的另一半
And I like my guys not quite so...

419
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,020
长得不要比我好看
better looking than me.

420
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,120
为什么要留在你从小长大的地方
Why did you stay in the town where you grew up?

421
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,670
为什么不重新开始
I mean, why not start fresh?

422
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,650
因为我不会逃避自我
Because I'm not running away from who I was.

423
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,430
我相信犯错不要紧
I was taught it's okay to make mistakes,

424
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,120
每个人都应该有第二次机会
and I believe everyone deserves a second chance.

425
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,690
威胁假释犯的生命  道米尼克
Threatening a parolee's life, Dominic?

426
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,440
这是个误会
This is some kind of misunderstanding.

427
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,280
景气不太好
Just a little depressed, huh?

428
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,860
工作不易做
You got a tough job.

429
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,180
依我看来  你是不太擅长
From what I'm seeing here, you're not very good at it.

430
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,620
你的重新犯罪率最高
You got the worst recidivism rate in your office.

431
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,180
上个月送进牢里的人数比我还多
Kicked more guys back inside last month than I did.

432
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,730
有些人说是被你陷害
Some were even saying they were set up.

433
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,790
警探  你知道罪犯的套话就是"我没干"
You know a criminal's motto, detective: "I didn't do it."

434
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,030
你从事的是公共服务工作  格鲁斯卡先生
You're doing a public service, Mr. Galuska.

435
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
活累  钱少
Hard work, crap pay.

436
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,080
所以你开好车这一点还挺奇怪
Which is why it's interesting you drive such a nice truck.

437
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,220
我阿姨几个月前去世了
My aunt passed away a couple of months ago.

438
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,610
给我留了点儿钱
Left me some money.

439
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,040
关你啥事儿
Why do you care?

440
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,280
有人受伤就关我事儿
I care when people get hurt.

441
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,060
比如你的假释犯  阿隆索・加西亚
Like your parolee, Alonso Garcia.

442
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,050
他今天下午被车撞死了
Guy got run over in red hook this afternoon.

443
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,720
他要乖点也不至于这样
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

444
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,050
你知道加西亚先生
Did you know Mr. Garcia

445
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,550
两天前企图谋杀安卓娅・古特雷斯吗
Tried to kill Andrea Gutierrez two nights ago?

446
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,390
我说过了  他要乖点也不至于这样了
Like I said, couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

447
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,080
无论如何  我也想不明白为什么
I can't, for the life of me, figure out what kind of grudge

448
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,000
阿隆索・加西亚会怨恨古特雷斯小姐  你呢
Alonso Garcia would have against Ms. Gutierrez, can you?

449
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,670
我想我现在需要律师了
I think I'm ready for my lawyer now.

450
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,840
没错
Yeah.

451
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,930
如何
How'd it go?

452
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,630
不好意思  我这回考了个零鸭蛋
I'm sorry, got a big goose egg on this one.

453
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,190
格鲁斯卡被放了
Galuska walked.

454
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,940
没事  你做得很好 卡特
Oh, no, you did great, Carter.

455
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,860
你们俩还在聊天的时候
Because while you two were having a chat,

456
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,760
我进了他的公寓
I got into his apartment,

457
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,160
借走了他的电脑
Borrowed his computer.

458
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,610
你擅闯他的公寓
You broke into his apartment?

459
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,600
你说你不能干违法的勾当
You said you couldn't do anything illegal.

460
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,300
你可没说我不能
You didn't say anything about me.

461
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,940
格先生该学会用生日之外的密码
Mr. Galuska should know better than to protect

462
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,660
来保护他的重要文件
His important files with his birth date.

463
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,050
对于一个年薪不超过万的人来说
That's a hell of a lot of money in the bank for a man

464
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,080
这钱可有点多啊
Who makes less than 50 grand a year.

465
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,050
每笔存款时间都吻合
Each deposit coincides with when he sent

466
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,750
他的假释人被送回监狱的时间
One of his parolees back to prison.

467
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,950
他肯定是在从哪里拿回扣
He's getting kickbacks from somewhere or someone.

468
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,050
监狱是个大生意
Prisons are big business.

469
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,390
囚犯越多  经费越多
The more inmates, the more funding.

470
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,730
格先生三天前从他户头里
Mr. Galuska took out exactly $9,900

471
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,300
取了九千九
From his savings account three days ago.

472
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,560
任何超过一万的交易都会报备国税局
Anything over 10,000 gets flagged by the IRS.

473
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,470
他付阿隆索・加西亚钱去刺杀安卓娅
He paid Alonso Garcia to kill Andrea.

474
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,630
这还不是唯一的取现
That's not the only withdrawal.

475
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,990
还有一样的一笔钱也取现了
There's another one in the same amount

476
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,120
就在昨晚
Just last night.

477
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,190
也就是说
That means--

478
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,680
他雇了其他人来完成这事
He hired someone else to finish the job.

479
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,450
约翰
John!

480
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,050
约翰  这是怎么回事
John, what is going on?

481
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,720
我是不需要你的服务了  安卓娅
I don't need your services anymore, Andrea.

482
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,070
但是我觉得你需要我的服务
But I think you're gonna need mine.

483
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,220
里瑟先生  你到安全屋了吗
Mr. Reese, are you at the safe house yet?

484
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,710
正在路上
Heading there now.

485
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,690
够了  这到底是怎么回事
Okay, what the hell?!

486
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,250
你有危险  安卓娅
You're in danger, Andrea.

487
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,230
这还要你说  拿枪那个人是谁
Um, you think? Who was the guy with the gun,

488
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,730
你又是谁  因为你刚刚偷袭他的时候
And who are you, because your back

489
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,900
你的背明明没问题
Seemed just fine when you went ninja on that guy.

490
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,240
我就像你  给别人第二次机会
I'm like you--I give people second chances.

491
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,990
那你从没进过监狱
So you were never in jail?

492
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,240
在这个国家没有
Not in this country.

493
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,380
不好意思
Excuse me.

494
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,330
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

495
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,710
我刚刚看到一份逮捕报告
An arrest report just came in

496
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,830
是你在法律图书馆逮住的那个人
For the gentleman you apprehended in the law library.

497
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,710
他名叫温德尔・兰茨
His name is Wendell Lentz,

498
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,100
而且我刚确认了他的假释官也是格鲁斯卡
And I've confirmed that he's one of Dominic Galuska's parolees.

499
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,300
好  我们得确保格鲁斯卡
Okay, we need to make sure Galuska doesn't have any more

500
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,020
不再派杀手找安卓娅麻烦
Killers out there looking for Andrea.

501
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,200
我做了什么
What did I do?

502
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,890
格鲁斯卡靠陷害前科犯赚钱
Galuska's getting money from someone to set up his ex-cons

503
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,280
然后把他们踢回监狱
And send them back to prison.

504
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,340
你那个特伦斯的案子彻底捅了马蜂窝
You kicked a hornet's nest with Terrence's case.

505
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,960
可能是格鲁斯卡在他家放了那些毒品
Galuska may have planted those drugs in his home.

506
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,120
我的天
Oh, my god.

507
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,030
这么说特伦斯真是无辜的
That means Terrence is actually innocent.

508
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,520
你都不确定
You weren't sure?

509
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,830
我也想这么想
I wanted to be.

510
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,730
特伦斯被逮捕那晚所做的药检
Terrence was given a drug test the night he was arrested,

511
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,820
结果是阴性
And it came back negative.

512
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,160
格鲁斯卡和劳教部门
Galuska and the Department of Corrections

513
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,820
很方便就能做手脚
Conveniently misplaced it.

514
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,880
我从没见过那份报告
I never got a copy of the report.

515
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,390
于是你再挖  结果发现了
A little more digging, you'd also have found

516
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,220
所有针对他的投诉
All the complaints filed against him.

517
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,030
假释人指控格鲁斯卡陷害他们
Parolees who said Galuska set them up.

518
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,180
-我得告诉特伦斯  -你留在这
- I need to tell Terrence. - You need to stay here

519
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,060
等我先找出他又雇了谁来杀你
Until I find out who else he may have hired to kill you

520
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,700
并且格鲁斯卡在为谁干活再说
And who galuska's working for.

521
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,400
呆在这  锁好门
Stay here, lock the doors,

522
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,050
谁来都不要开
And don't open them for anyone.

523
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,310
我想你该知道怎么用这个吧
I take it you know how to use this?

524
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,610
你要是跟我长在一个地方  就知道怎么保护自己
You grow up where I did, you know how to handle yourself.

525
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,510
你现在甩尾的功夫是越来越厉害了
You're getting better at ditching your tail.

526
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,480
没准你找到知法犯法的窍门了
Maybe you got a knack for breaking the law.

527
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,770
我又去查了遍格鲁斯卡的文件
I've been going back through Galuska's files

528
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,970
发现了个规律
And found a pattern.

529
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,750
去年  所有他抓到的假释人
In the past year, all the parolees

530
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,110
都是单亲
He's busted were single parents.

531
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,940
也就是说他们的子女要进收养机构
Which means their kids end up in foster care.

532
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,450
格鲁斯卡他不是在从假释人身上挣钱
Galuska wasn't getting paid for the parolees.

533
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,320
他在靠卖他们的小孩赚钱
He was getting paid for their kids.

534
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,580
每个小孩每个月能有800块
Each child is worth about 800 bucks a month.

535
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,990
格鲁斯卡肯定和家庭事务部的人合伙
Galuska's gotta be working with someone at DFS.

536
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,940
家庭事务部可是个大部门
Well, DFS is a big agency.

537
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,630
我得去会会金赛那俩口子了
I'm gonna have a talk with Mary and Paul Kinsey--

538
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,800
照顾特伦斯儿子的那个寄宿家庭双亲
The foster parents looking after Terrence King's kid.

539
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,390
你很在行  卡特
You're good at this, Carter.

540
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,380
这是我的工作
It's my job.

541
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,220
而且我还不用对人开枪就能办事
And I didn't even have to shoot anyone to do it.

542
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,110
我只有几个问题  金赛先生和夫人
I just have a few questions, Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey.

543
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,930
我保证不会花你们太多时间
I promise not to take up too much of your time.

544
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,230
出什么事了
Something wrong?

545
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,930
我是真希望没事  夫人
I certainly hope not, Ma'am.

546
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:47,990
这里说你们有六个寄养在你们家的孩子
I see here you have six foster children under you care.

547
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,910
-是不是这样  -是的  没错
- Is that still correct? - It is, yes.

548
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,510
好  那么  雅各布・金是不是当中一个
Okay, and, uh, Jacob King is one of those kids?

549
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,710
这跟雅各布有关么
This is about jacob?

550
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,730
他很想他爸爸  但是他适应得很好
He misses his dad, but... He's adjusting just fine.

551
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,320
你俩当中有人
Do you, either of you,

552
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,320
认识一个叫道米尼克・格鲁斯卡的人吗
Know a man named Dominic Galuska?

553
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,420
不认识  谁啊
No, who's that?

554
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,210
那格洛丽亚・科普兰呢
What about Gloria Copeland?

555
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,500
她是家庭事务部的寄养安排主管
She's the head of foster placement at DFS.

556
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,330
你们名下那六个孩子都睡哪
Where do all six of the children that are under your care sleep?

557
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,610
因为在我看来
Because it looks to me...

558
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,340
你们住的是一室一厅的公寓
You live in a one-bedroom apartment.

559
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,170
哪来那么多空间住六个小孩两个大人
Not much space for six kids and two adults.

560
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,070
得了  你们俩赶紧给我从实招来
Okay, you tell me the truth now, or I arrest both of you

561
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,760
不然我就按阻挠刑事案件调查罪名逮捕你们
For interfering with a criminal investigation.

562
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,560
雅各布是唯一一个还跟我们住一起的孩子
Jacob's the only child living with us right now.

563
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,630
那名单上的其他人  丽贝卡・强森  特里・怀特
So the others on the list, Rebecca Johnson, Trey White...

564
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,720
丽贝卡几个月前就逃走了
Rebecca ran away months ago.

565
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,440
特里・怀特和其他人  他们
Trey White and the other children, they...

566
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,440
不存在
The others don't exist.

567
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,160
但我敢说你们还拿着钱
But I bet you're still getting paid for all of them.

568
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,480
够了  保罗
Enough, Paul.

569
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,070
给我闭嘴
You shut your mouth.

570
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,410
格鲁斯卡一个人玩不出这种花样
Galuska's not smart enough to pull this off on his own.

571
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,660
所以他肯定有个家庭事务部的内应
So he had to have a contact at DFS,

572
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,400
而你们要告诉我那人是谁
And you are going to tell me who that person is.

573
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,570
我们要律师
We want a lawyer.

574
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,720
还要打电话
And our phone call.

575
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,510
哪都别去
Don't go anywhere.

576
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,580
谁啊
Who is this?

577
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,420
你认识我的  警探
You know who, Detective.

578
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,270
我要你让金赛夫妇去打电话
I want you to give the Kinseys their phone call.

579
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,750
你这是在干扰我办案
You are interrupting me

580
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,720
我还在审讯中
In the middle of an interrogation.

581
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,890
在我看来已经审讯结束了
Sounded like the end of an interrogation to me.

582
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,280
他们都要叫律师了
They asked for their lawyer.

583
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
你怎么会知道
How would you know that?

584
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,610
你窃听我电话了
Are you bugging my phone?

585
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,120
我要你让金赛夫妇去打电话
I want you to give the Kinseys their phone call.

586
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,120
除非我问出那内应  否则免谈
Not until I find out who their contact at DFS is.

587
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,900
我们认为这已经有答案了  警探
We think we already know who that person is, Detective.

588
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,240
我们查了格鲁斯卡逮捕的最后六个人
We've checked the DFS filings for the last six parolees

589
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,140
在家庭事务部的文件记录
That Galuska busted.

590
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,330
所有的六份文件都是同一个署名
The signatures on all six belong to one woman:

591
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,630
格洛丽亚・科普兰
Gloria Copeland.

592
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,300
行啊  但这不足以作为证据逮捕她
Yeah, but that's not enough evidence to arrest her.

593
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,660
家庭事务部就是个巨型文件堆
DFS is a mountain of paperwork.

594
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,280
要理清楚得花几个月的时间
It'd take months to sort through it all,

595
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,450
并且如果金赛夫妇通知了她
And if the Kinseys tip her off,

596
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,290
科普兰肯定会销毁证据
Copeland's only gonna destroy the evidence.

597
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,260
这正是我们所希望的
That's exactly what we want her to do.

598
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,400
如果我们要合作  警探
If we're gonna work together, detective,

599
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,980
还是需要彼此间留点信任
A little bit of trust is in order.

600
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,830
芬奇  进去了吗
Finch, are you in?

601
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,640
刚进
Just.

602
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,960
你得抓紧了
Well, you need to move fast.

603
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,670
多谢你的提醒  里瑟先生
Thanks for that newsflash, mr. Reese.

604
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,340
我现在动作慢慢吞吞地
Here I was planning to move at a sloth-like pace

605
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,010
正指望着自己被逮着呢
and get myself captured.

606
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,350
扫描仪装好了  里瑟先生
The scanner's installed, mr. Reese.

607
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,940
这样够快了吗
Was that fast enough for you?

608
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,110
喂
Hello?

609
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,230
这是一个从布鲁克林拘留所
Will you accept a collect call

610
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,600
付费电话  你愿意接吗
from metropolitan detention center, Brooklyn,

611
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,370
来电人是  特伦斯
On behalf of Terrence?

612
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,430
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

613
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,090
特伦斯  怎么了
Terrence, what's wrong?

614
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,910
他们明天要把我转到阿提卡监狱
They're moving me to Attica tomorrow.

615
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,860
什么
What?!

616
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,290
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - I don't know.

617
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,150
但听着  那里不是拘留所
But look, that's not a detention facility.

618
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,050
是最高级别的监狱
That's maximum security...

619
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,360
我去了那里就死定了
And I can't make it in there.

620
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,550
听着  我会提交一份禁令叫停转监
Look, I'm just gonna file an injunction to stop the transfer.

621
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,810
我们需要找人帮忙说服法官
We're gonna need some help convincing a judge.

622
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,890
好吧
Okay, all right.

623
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,410
我会想办法解决  好吗  特
I'm gonna take care of this, okay, T?

624
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,480
好
Right.

625
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,490
我们的看法没错
We were right.

626
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,650
金赛夫妇肯定告诉了格洛丽亚・科普兰
The Kinseys must have contacted Gloria Copeland.

627
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,940
她开始销毁文件了
She's begun shredding the documents.

628
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,560
我收到了扫描件
I'm getting the scans now.

629
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,860
看来每次道米尼克・格鲁斯卡
Looks like every time Dominic Galuska

630
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,230
把他的一个假释犯送回监狱
Sends one of his parolees back to prison,

631
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,800
科普兰女士就利用家庭寄养的程序
Ms. Copeland uses the foster care paperwork

632
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,780
来隐藏她捏造的孩子
To hide the kids she's fabricated.

633
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,120
她让假释犯看起来
She makes it look like the parolees

634
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,850
有比实际更多的孩子
Have more kids than they actually do.

635
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,460
这么一来肯定能每月诈取25万
This scam must be worth upwards of $1/4 million a month.

636
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,540
我们有麻烦了  芬奇
We got a problem then, Finch.

637
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,220
格洛丽亚・科普兰提前下班了
Gloria Copeland left work early.

638
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,040
销毁文件的那个人不是她
She isn't the one shredding the documents.

639
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,970
格鲁斯卡在家庭事务部的内线另有其人
Galuska's got a different contact at DFS.

640
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,940
安卓娅  你在这里做什么
Andrea, wh--what are you doing here?

641
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,030
特伦斯明早要被转去阿提卡监狱
Terrence is being transferred to attica in the morning.

642
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
你想要我怎么做
Um, what do you want me to do about it?

643
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,440
打给他案子的办事员  克里斯
Call his case worker, Chris.

644
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,370
告诉她联系签那道文件的法官
Tell her to contact the judge who made the order.

645
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,980
转监对孩子不利
The transfer's not in the best interest of the child.

646
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,590
不行
I can't do that.

647
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,900
你怎么了  为什么不行
What's wrong with you? Why not?

648
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,090
因为是我让法官下令转监的
Because I'm the one that asked the judge to move him.

649
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,510
你和格鲁斯卡是一伙的
You're working with Galuska.

650
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,190
你知道这事可惜在哪里吗  小安
You know the shame of it, Andi?

651
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,280
到头来发现其实你的确是个不错的律师
Turns out you're actually a pretty good lawyer.

652
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,590
只是没人会知道了
Not that anyone's ever gonna know it.

653
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,740
里瑟先生  我在比对格洛丽亚・科普兰
Mr. Reese, I'm running a handwriting analysis

654
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,470
和克里斯・斯科拉的签名
On the signatures of Gloria Copeland and Chris Scollard.

655
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,280
他们两个人名字里的R完全一致
The rs in both names are identical.

656
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,870
他伪造了她的签名
He forged her signature.

657
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,020
格洛丽亚・科普兰完全不知道真相
Gloria Copeland had no idea what was going on.

658
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,350
你为什么这么做  克里斯
Why would you do this, Chris?

659
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,820
你怎么能背叛那些家庭
How could you betray all those families?

660
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,220
那些孩子在寄养家庭
Those kids were better off with their foster families

661
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,260
比在那些罪犯父母身边更好
Than they ever were with their convict parents.

662
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,390
特伦斯的儿子让他有理由远离毒品
Terrence's son gave him a reason to stay clean.

663
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,430
他有工作和他的生活
He got a job, a life.

664
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,180
你有什么资格拆散他们的家庭
Who are you to take away their chance at being a family?

665
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,460
我挺佩服你的同情心
I admire that bleeding heart of yours.

666
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,890
我宁愿同情心泛滥也不要铁石心肠
I'd rather it bleed than stop beating altogether.

667
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,960
他跑了
He's getting away.

668
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,790
他跑不了
No, he's not.

669
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,380
纽约警察  转过身去
NYPD. Turn around.

670
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,580
扔下枪
Drop your weapon.

671
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,500
扔掉
Drop it!

672
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,670
过来  小家伙
Whoa, come here, buddy.

673
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,040
我好想你  伙计
Oh, I missed you, man.

674
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,660
我想死你了
I missed you so much.

675
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,290
我马上回来
Um, I'll be right back.

676
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,030
好
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,480
我读了你的结案陈词
I read about your settlement with the state.

678
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,720
冤狱  诽谤
Wrongful imprisonment, defamation of character--

679
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,390
还有侵犯公民权
Don't forget violation of civil rights

680
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,840
和恶意起诉
And malicious prosecution.

681
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,150
你得到了一千万中的30%  不赖
You get 30% of $10 million. Not bad.

682
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,490
也许你可以不用再溜进纽约大学的图书馆了
Maybe you can stop sneaking into NYU's library.

683
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,780
我想我还是先买双新鞋子吧
I think I'm gonna start with a new pair of shoes.

684
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,200
再说  我喜欢那里
Besides, I like it in there.

685
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,620
那里气氛很棒
Has a good vibe.

686
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,450
你都差点在那里被杀
Even after you almost go killed?

687
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,910
有你和你复杂的工作救我了嘛
Well, I had you and your complicated job to save me.

688
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,690
你没想过找一份风险小点的工作吗
You ever think of having a less hazardous profession

689
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,000
比如登山或摔跤啥的
Like mountain climbing or bear wrestling?

690
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,970
我是说  为你不认识的人冒生命危险
I mean, is it really worth risking your life

691
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,370
真的值得吗
For people you don't know?

692
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,590
不是只有你相信人有第二次机会
You're not the only one who believes in second chances.

693
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,560
谢谢你
Thank you.

694
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,070
哈罗德叔叔
Hey, uncle harold.

695
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,070
你打电话来时  我以为你又要走了
When you called, I assumed it was going to be good-bye again.

696
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,280
不  我不准备卖房子了
No, I'm not gonna sell the place.

697
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,730
反正现在不会
Not right away, anyway.

698
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,750
你又开始住院实习了吗
Are you taking up your residency again?

699
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,080
不
No.

700
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,670
我不想再帮人缝缝补补了
I'm done patching people up,

701
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,880
我想更了解我父亲
And I wanna find out more about my dad.

702
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,840
看看这个
Look at this.

703
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,790
这是你考进医学院那天
This was the day you got into med school.

704
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,170
他多么为你骄傲
He was so proud of you.

705
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,410
一直是这样
Always was.

706
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,410
我翻他的东西时
Going through his things,

707
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,680
才发现我有多不了解他
I realize how little I really knew him.

708
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,520
我觉得大多数父亲对儿子来说都很神秘
I think most fathers are a mystery to their sons.

709
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,550
大多数儿子都没机会
Well, most sons don't have the advantage

710
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,970
看到未经授权的自传
Of reading the unauthorized biography.

711
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,460
或是这些
Or all this.

712
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,090
这是他把半个公司留给我时
It's from the audit his lawyers did

713
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,770
他的律师们做的审计
When he left me his half of the company.

714
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,620
而大多我都搞不明白
Now, most of it I don't understand.

715
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,440
我超不擅长电脑  就像你  是吗
I get lost when it comes to computers, like you, right?

716
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,460
是啊
Right.

717
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,440
但有些事情我很清楚
But, there are some things I do understand.

718
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,740
事情互相矛盾
Inconsistencies like... Did you know

719
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,210
你知道他的公司关闭了七年之久吗
That he shut down IFT for nearly seven years?

720
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,280
是  我知道他缩减了规模
Yes, I knew that he downsized a bit.

721
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,250
他付了所有员工一笔遣散金
Well, he gave all his employees severance

722
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,620
还给他们寄了包裹
And sent them packing.

723
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,420
他为什么要这么做
Why would he do that?

724
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,590
还有  看这个  不论他在做什么
And, look, whatever it was that he was working on,

725
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,090
他以一美元的价格卖给了政府
He sold it to the government for a dollar.

726
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,650
也就是说这件东西不是一文不值
So that means it was either something worthless...

727
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,640
就是无价之宝
Or priceless.

728
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,320
他有和你说起过吗
Did he ever talk to you about it?

729
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,770
我是说  你是他最好的朋友
I mean, you were his closest friend.

730
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,960
没有  他从没说过
No, he never did.

731
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,940
你去哪了  芬奇
Where have you been, Finch?

732
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,560
我今天不回办公室了
I won't be back in the office today.

733
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,230
也许你今天该好好休息下
Maybe you should take the rest of the day off as well.

734
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,850
你想和我聊聊吗
You want to talk about it?

735
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,730
不太想
Not particularly.

736
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,620
但你得承认  你有心事
But you admit there is something going on,

737
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,380
你在担心什么事
Something that you're worried about.

738
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,660
这让我很担心你
That makes me worried.

739
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,380
你不用担心我  里瑟先生
Well, you needn't, mr. Reese.

740
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,910
我希望你明白  有些事情
I hope you understand that there are certain things

741
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,190
我不能告诉你
That I can't tell you.

742
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,020
我完全明白  芬奇
Oh, I understand completely, Finch.
