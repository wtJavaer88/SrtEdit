1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,750
你正被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,510
政府有一套秘密的系统
The government has a secret system-

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,550
有一台机器 无时无刻不在监视着你
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,070
我知道 因为这个系统是我建的
I know,because I built it.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,650
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖行动 但事实上它可以侦测到任何事
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,but it sees everything...

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
包括发生在平民百姓身上的暴力犯罪 像你一样的普通百姓
Violent crimes involving ordinary people,people like you,

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,780
在政府看来无关紧要的暴力犯罪
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,570
他们不采取行动  所以我决定我要去干预
They wouldn't act,so I decided I would.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,510
但我需要一个搭档 某个有能力去干预的人
But I needed a partner - Someone with the skills to intervene.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,640
为了躲避当局追查  我们只能秘密行动
Hunted by the authorities,we work in secret.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,550
你永远不会发现我们
You will never find us.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,280
但受害者 罪犯 要是你的号码 被选出来 我们一定会找到你
But victim or perpetrator,if your number's up,we'll find you.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,670

我已经告诉过你们美国人了... 我运送的是蔬果

16
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,260
你为基地组织运送炸药
You deliver explosives for al-qaeda.

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,000
你的电话引爆了自杀式炸弹 杀死了三名在费卢杰的美国士兵
Your cell is responsible for a suicide bomb that killed three u.s.Soldiers in fallujah.

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,030
你应该告诉我其余炸弹的位置
You should tell me the location of the remainder of those explosives.

19
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,240
跟我说吧 不然你得去跟我老大谈谈了
Talk to me,or else you're gonna have to talk to my boss.

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,310
相信我 你绝不会想跟我老大谈话的
And believe me when I tell you,you don't want to talk to my boss.

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,130
好吧
All right.

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,290
你好 Yusuf
Hello,yusuf.

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,470
靠太近了 已经够了 她得除掉... 就今天
Getting too close - Enough already.She goes... Today.

24
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,600
一定要做得干干净净
But it's got to be clean.

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,910
你不能一直这个样子来这儿 我要走了
- You can't keep coming in here like this. - I gotta go.

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,010
Carter警探 Kovach太太来保释她的丈夫
Detective carter? It's Mrs.Kovach here to bail out her husband.

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,340
- 又来了? - 我想也许你能和她谈谈

28

谢谢

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,260
我负责的是凶杀案 Kovach太太 明白么?
I work homicide,mrs.Kovach,okay?

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,740
等你丈夫最终把你打死时 负责调查的就是我
I'm the one who has to investigate it when your husband finally beats you to death.

31
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,450
你一次次地跟我们说是意外
Look,every time you tell us it was an accident,

32
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,630
每说一次 你笨拙 经常出事故的形象就加深一点
you're strengthening the story he's gonna use to get out of it-

33
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,590
而他将会用这一点来逃避惩罚
That you were clumsy,accident-prone.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,780
你听到我说话了么?
Do you hear me?

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,070
是楼梯 我从楼梯上摔下来了
The stairs. I fell down the stairs.

36
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,630
如果他再碰你 打给我
If he puts his hands on you again,call me.

37
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,590
抱歉 我得走了
Sorry. I have to go.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,850
我不知道你为什么要烦心 Carter 你救不了所有人
I don't know why you bother,carter.You can't save 'em all.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,140
这是一起潜在的凶杀案
That's a homicide waiting to happen.

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,820
我只是想有点改变 看能不能阻止
Figured I'd try to stop one for a change.

41
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,880
几个星期前 你开枪打伤那家伙的DNA报告出来了

42

43
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,450
有一半的DNA与Marlene Elias匹配

44
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,980
另一半与Don Moretti匹配

45
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,540
Carl Elias 那个你在40年前杀了他的母亲
Carl elias-the bastard son you left to rot in the system

46
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,730
你的情妇后 扔在领养系统里自生自灭的
after you murdered his mother almost 40 years ago.

47
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,570
- 你的私生子 - 我之前就说过 亲爱的
- Your mistress. - I told you before,sweetheart.

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,650
我不是那谁谁谁的父亲
I ain't the father of nobody by that name.

49
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,880
DNA可不这么说 Don 你们的DNA完全匹配
Dna says otherwise,don.You're a perfect match.

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,230
你猜怎么着 你的儿子现在长大了
And guess what.Your son's all grown up now.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,210
这是一些他最近的受害者

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,120
退休的警探Bernie Sullivan 你以前的分舵老大Vincent Deluca
Retired detective bernie sullivan,your old capo vincent deluca.

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,030
这算什么? 关我什么事? 我反正是要老死在这里了
What is this? What do I care? I'm gonna die an old man in here.

54
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,780
或许你会比你预想的要早死
Maybe sooner than you think.

55
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,140
你杀了他的母亲 你把他丢在狼窝里
You killed his mother,and you left him to the wolves.

56
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,270
你觉得他会怎么对你?
What do you think he's gonna do to you?

57
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,090
是我可不会指望有父亲节的卡片
I wouldn't expect any father's day cards.

58
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,610
如果你帮了我  我能给你提供保护
If you help me,I can offer you protective custody.

59
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,000
你以为你在跟谁讲话?
Who do you think you're talking to?

60
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,220
你不明白 无论在哪里 Elias都能接近你
You don't get it. Elias can get to you anywhere.

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,240
他能找到你认识的人 通过他们接近你
He can find someone you know,turn them on you.

62
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,320
这不是能不能的问题 而是时间问题
And you know what?It's not a question of if,but when.

63
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,570
这家伙已经干掉了一个警察 因为你查这案子靠得太近 就要杀你 
Telling me this guy already took out a cop,took a shot at you 'cause you got too close,

64
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,540
你却跑来这儿警告我?
and you came here to warn me,huh?

65
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,970
你就当成是礼节性拜访吧
Consider it a courtesy call.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,500
是有个专案组在查Elias 还是只有你一个人在查 警探?
There a task force going after this elias,or is it just you,detective?

67
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,730
这是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

68
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,900
从我的角度看 你是孤身一人
Way it looks from my side of the fence,you're all alone.

69
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,460
我觉得也许他正想要干掉你呢
Sounds to me like maybe he's coming after you.

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,920
所有人员注意 168街和奥杜邦交界发生枪击案

路边到处是9毫米弹壳

74
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
看起来像驾车枪击
Looks like it was a drive-by.

75
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,730
有目击者看到那辆车了吗?
Any witnesses see the car?

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,490
在这个街区? 你在开玩笑吧?
In this neighborhood? You're kidding,right?

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,110
- Ronnie Middleton - 你认识这个孩子?

- This kid was a snitch? - Yeah.He got cold feet though.

81

撤回了他的证词 检察官就撤诉了
Recanted his testimony. D.a. Dropped the case.

82
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,360
看起来Hector找到了他
Looks like hector found him.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,220
他这次溜不掉了                                                                        
He won't get away with it again.

84
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,500

我知道有人看到了些什么
And I know somebody saw something.

我在后面忙活着 直到警察来之前我什么都没有听到
I was busy in the back.I- I-I didn't hear anything till the police showed up.

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,740
我觉得很难让人信服 Castillo先生
See,I find that hard to believe,Mr.Castillo.

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,870
因为那个年轻小伙在你店里 买了Mariquitas苏打
After that young man bought this mariquitas soda from your store...

110
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,350
他走了出去 然后被人像一条狗一样杀死在街上

好吧 所以你是听到了枪声的

什么? 你在哪里?
What? Where are you?

124
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,430
在凶杀现场 我在想为什么 机器能看到一些人却忽略了另一些人
At the scene of a homicide,wondering how the machine can see one and miss another.

125
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,750
我很抱歉 Reese先生 机器只能侦测到有预谋的行为
I'm sorry,Mr.Reese.The machine detects acts of premeditation.

126
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,150
这个机器现在看到的号码 我恐怕会是个大麻烦
And I'm afraid we've got a big problem with the one it's seeing right now.

我没见过那车 也没听有人 谈起Hector 但我会去打听
I didn't see the car or hear nobody talk about hector,but I can ask around.

276
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:44,205
留神点 B.C.
Good looking out,b.c.

277
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:49,685
如果你有Hector或者Elias的消息 还会有更多钱
If you get anything back on,um,hector or elias,there's more where that came from.

278
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,575
嘿 队长
Hey,captain.

279
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,625
欢迎回来 警探
Welcome back,detective.

280
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,605
没想到你跟市区那些
Didn't think you'd grace us with your presence again

281
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:09,025
喷香水的人一起后还会赏脸回来
once you spent time with the perfumed folk downtown.

282
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,105
你这个笨蛋是怎么发达的?
How'd a half-wit like you pull that off?

283
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:14,085
我想我这笨蛋还是有一手的 嗯 队长?
I guess the half-wit's still got some juice,huh,captain?

284
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:18,025
他们让我和Carter警探搭档...
They got me working with detective carter,and...

285
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:20,215
我听到些传言
I'm starting to hear some things.

286
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,875
是嘛? 比如?
Yeah? Like what?

287
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:27,555
也许 呃 有些人不喜欢她
Maybe she's not so well-liked by,uh,a certain element.

288
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:32,195
听着 Lionel... 事情又恢复往昔了
Listen,lionel... Things are going back to the way they used to be.

289
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:35,215
- 往昔? - 黑帮那些事儿?
- Used to be? - Thing about organized crime?

290
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:37,905
有组织 管用
It was organized.Things worked.

291
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,325
一切守时有序
Trains ran on time.

292
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:43,805
这个新人... 他懂规矩
This new guy... He knows the rules.

293
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:46,775
新人 你是说Elias
New guy - You mean elias.

294
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,025
组织管理得很严密... 低调
Runs a tight ship... Low profile.

295
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,345
跟那些凶残的俄国白痴不一样
Not like these cutthroat russian idiots.

296
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:56,565
他知道要贿赂谁... 关节一直通到市政府里
He knows who to grease... All the way up to city hall.

297
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,405
听着 现在的经济情况就是一坨屎
Look,the economy's in the toilet.

298
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,555
Carter警探不懂游戏规则
Detective carter doesn't understand the rules.

299
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:04,195
她对生意不好
She's bad for business.

300
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:05,605
她做了什么?
What'd she do?

301
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,495
到处查探... 想要找证据
Sniffing around... Trying to build a case.

302
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,395
她枪头直指Elias 必须解决她
She's gunning for elias.She's got to go.

303
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:15,295
杀一个警察可不容易
It's a tricky business,getting rid of a cop.

304
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:20,395
通过合适的后门...  直接通过上面下命令 
Went through the proper back channels... Up the chain of command.

305
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,315
已经授权了
Permission granted.

306
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:25,465
只需要做得... 干净
It's just got to look... Clean.

307
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:29,965
"干净"?  你是说弄得像殉职?
"Clean"? You mean like in the line of duty?

308
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,585
我开始觉得被夹在中间啊
I'm starting to feel caught in the middle here,captain.

309
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,025
如果我是你 就保持距离
I'd keep my distance,if I were you.

310
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:52,395
你没有去警局啊 你答应我的 Castillo先生
You didn't come down to the precinct like you told me you would,mr.Castillo.

311
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:55,135
今天我没帮手 我很忙
I got no help today. I'm a very busy man.

312
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:58,545
枪击发生前后 你有没有见过这辆车?
Did you see this car before or after the shooting?

313
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,805
你没跟我说那个被杀的 是另一件枪击案的目击者
You didn't tell me that the guy that they killed was a witness to another shooting.

314
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,715
他决定不出庭作证 但那没救他的命
He decided not to testify.Didn't save him.

315
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:08,315
如果你觉得这能说服我 那你错了
If you think that's gonna convince me to,it's not helping.

316
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:13,265
关键是... 如果Hector Alvarez 认为你看见他杀人
The point is... If hector alvarez thinks you saw him shoot someone,

317
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,705
他也会来杀你的
he's gonna come after you too.

318
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:18,395
求你了 听着 我有家人
Please.Look,I have a family.

319
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,795
对极了
Exactly.

320
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,625
如果你帮我 我会保护你和你的家人
If you help me,I can protect you and your family.

321
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:29,475
如果你不作证... 他还是会来杀你的
If you don't... He could still come after you.

322
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:32,105
怎么说 Lionel?
What's the word,lionel?

323
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:34,585
我四处打听了一下
I did some checking around.

324
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:37,465
Carter的名字冒出来 而且还不是好事
Carter's name came up and not in a good way.

325
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:39,525
Elias想她死... 今天
Elias wants her gone... Today.

326
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,595
杀警察太引人注意了
Killing a cop brings a lot of heat.

327
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,715
嗯 所以他们会做得很干净
Yeah,which is why they're gonna make it look clean.

328
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:47,465
他会找个替罪羊 或买通她正在查的案子里的人
He could set up a patsy or pay someone off on a case she's working.

329
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:51,495
我只知道 Carter时刻有被杀的危险
All I know is,every door that carter walks through could have a bullet behind it.

330
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:55,705
昨晚这人来你店里了吗?
Did you see this guy in your store last night?

331
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:59,315
拜托 我只需要知道这个
Please. That's all I need.

332
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,545
我之前见过他
I saw him earlier.

333
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:09,495
以前他来买过保险套 啤酒
He's been in my store before,to buy condoms,beer.

334
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,675
有什么关系?  反正我不会给你作证
What does it mater? I'm not gonna give you a statement anyways.

335
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:14,465
可以请你离开我的店吗?
Can you please leave my store?

336
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:18,345
好吧 好吧 谢谢
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

337
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,565
哦 对不起 警探
Oh,sorry,detective.

338
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:30,255
我从后面没认出是你来
I didn't realize that was you from behind.

339
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,625
如今外面太多美女了
Lot of fine girls out today.

340
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,825
走开 情圣
Keep it moving,lover boy.

341
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,005
在这个街区你可得小心
You got to be careful on this block.

342
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:38,705
我听说昨晚有个小孩被杀了
I heard some kid got popped last night.

343
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:41,275
你有孩子吗 警探?
You got any kids,detective?

344
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,635
离这个街区远点
Stay off this block.

345
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:49,435
我再看见这车经过这里一次 我就会扣押它
I see this car roll by one more time,i'm gonna impound it.

346
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:52,555
回头见 Castillo先生
I'll be seeing you around,mr.Castillo.

347
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:58,885
- 快滚 - 我们走
- Get out of here. - Let's go.

348
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,117
Elias要除掉Carter
Elias wants carter gone.

349
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:17,227
可能会利用有杀她动机的人... 她手上的嫌疑犯
Possible he'll use someone with motive... The suspect in one of her cases.

350
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,317
Carter在酒吧
Carter's at a bar.

351
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,507
我以为她在工作呢
I thought she was on duty.

352
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:27,577
有这么多人想找她麻烦 我都想请她喝一杯
With this many people after her,i'd be inclined to pick up the tab.

353
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,777
说说看 Eddie...
Tell me,eddie...

354
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:36,987
哪种混蛋会把老婆打成这样?
What kind of degenerate es that to his wife?

355
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,307
Carter去见Kovach了
Carter's paying kovach a visit.

356
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:42,677
负责谋杀案的警官怎么还管家务事?
Why is a homicide detective intervening in a domestic case?

357
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:47,277
也许她跟我们一样 想阻止不好的事情发生
Maybe she's like us.Trying to prevent something bad from happening.

358
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:53,867
夫妻之间的家务事关你屁事
What happens between a man and his woman behind closed doors is none of your damn business.

359
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,647
你喝死了我都不管
Can't stop you from boozing your life away.

360
00:21:56,707 --> 00:22:01,247
但你要是回家再对老婆动手 我不会放过你
But you go home and put your hands on your wife again,i'm coming after you.

361
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:05,907
你要是来干涉 休怪我枪杆子伺候
You come after me,and I will exercise my second amendment rights.

362
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:11,077
我告诉你 我那把枪可大
And I promise you,I got a pretty big gun.

363
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,447
像你这种狂暴恶毒的人...
Man as angry and bitter as you are...

364
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:19,767
<i>枪 Gun: 美俚中有男性生殖器的意思</i>
I got a feeling it ain't that big,eddie.

365
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:19,767
我觉着你那把"枪"不会很大 Eddie

366
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:27,257
不得不承认 Finch 我喜欢她这范儿
I got to admit,finch,I sure like her style.

367
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:30,687
我想我们有领头羊了

都死于你帮忙运送的自杀炸弹背心
All were killed from a suicide vest you helped transport.

372
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:53,287
他们有家庭... 有爱他们的人
They had families... People that loved them.

373
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:58,797
我为士兵们感到惋惜 但我运的是蔬菜
I'm sorry for the soldiers,but I deliver vegetables.

374
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:03,207
我知道你为基地组织卖命 Yusuf...
I know you're working with al-qaeda,yusuf...

375
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:08,117
因为我有你装货的照片
'cause I have photos here of you loading vests into your truck.

376
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:13,637
你想说这些照片都是假的吗?
Now,you want to tell me all these photos of you are fake?

377
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:18,307
告诉我其他自杀炸弹藏在哪儿 Yusuf
Show me where the other suicide vests are hidden,yusuf.

378
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:20,747
指出来
Point to the location.

379
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:30,487
你知道要是他们知道 我帮了你会怎么对我吗?
Do you know what they will do if they find out that I helped you?

380
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:33,577
会杀了我妻子
They will kill my wife.

381
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,347
杀了我儿子
They will kill my son.

382
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,727
还不如你现在杀了我呢
I would rather you just kill me now.

383
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:58,047
Carter 是我们赶到时已经死了的 那个 Ronnie Middleton的手机吗?
Carter,is that the d.o.a.'s phone - Ronnie middleton?

384
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:00,677
她妈妈还没去太平间
His mother hasn't even come to the morgue.

385
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,387
这孩子一直是一个人
This kid was all alone.

386
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,157
他不该这么惨 
He deserved better.

387
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:07,057
到现在还没找到一点 有关Hector的线索
So far,I've got nothing on hector.

388
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,817
即时犯罪打击中心的分析员
Analyst from the real-time crime center sent over footage

389
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:12,617
把Nueva杂货店附近 一些摄像头的录像发了过来
from some of the cameras around bodega la nueva.

390
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:12,737
**

391
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,167
一些? 还不止这些摄像头吗?
Some? There's more cameras than this?

392
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,117
是的 市长希望每个角落都装上
Yeah. Mayor wants one on every corner.

393
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:18,187
怪不得我总觉得有人看着我
Wow,no wonder I feel like I'm always being watched.

394
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:23,887
我觉得Hector那辆肌肉车 应该经过这个路口 但什么都没有
I figured hector's g.t.o.Had to pass through this intersection,but nothing,nada.

395
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:26,037
也许他没开车 走过去的
Maybe he didn't drive. Maybe he walked.

396
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:32,387
Castillo说 他去过店里几次 买酒和避孕套
Castillo said he came into his market a couple times to purchase some booze and trojans.

397
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,567
- 然后呢? - 他女朋友也住在布朗克斯区
- So? - His girlfriend lives in the bronx too.

398
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:37,987
买个避孕套 干嘛要走25个街区?
Why would he have to go 25 blocks downtown for condoms?

399
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,777
因为唐璜(莫里哀笔下的花心流氓) 还有个小情人
'Cause don juan got a little chicky on the side..

400
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:45,577
Hector是走过去的
Hector was on foot.

401
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:48,507
也许他从她公寓走到店里
Maybe he walked from her apartment to the market.

402
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,797
在那儿撞见的Ronnie
And that's where hector bumped into ronnie.

403
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,427
如果能找到这个小情人 也许能找到新的证人
if we can find this chica,we might have ourselves a new witness.

404
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:54,707
我打几个电话
I'm gonna make some phone calls.

405
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:57,307
我得走了 回头再谢我吧?
Look,I got to go.You can thank me later,all right?

406
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:00,037
这么快又想我了?
Hello.What,do you miss me already?

407
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,557
这个比较困难 Lionel
You're a hard man to miss,lionel.

408
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:03,847
只能说Carter的情况让你担心了
I'd say this carter situation's got you worried.

409
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:06,237
你准备怎么办 从现在开始跟着她?
What are you gonna do,follow her around from now on?

410
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:08,347
不是我跟 你去跟
I'm not. You are.

411
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:10,887
我还有些事要做
I've got some business to take care of.

412
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:13,257
别让她惹上麻烦
Don't let her get in any trouble.

413
00:25:13,297 --> 00:25:14,267
Carter在追查你
Carter's gunning for you.

414
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:15,847
靠 她也许会抓到你
