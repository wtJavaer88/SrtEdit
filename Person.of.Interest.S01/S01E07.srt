1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,290
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,190
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,720
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,650
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,660
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,830
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,730
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,780
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,810
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,650
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,910
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner.

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,660
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,020
因为受当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,620
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,790
不管你是被害人还是行凶者  如果你的号码被列出来
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up,

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,100
我们就会找到你
we'll find you.

17

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,970
电话来了  目标已锁定  
The call came in. We have a location on the target.

19
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,460
多叫几个人  我马上过去和你们汇合
Get a team, and I'll meet you there.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,870
我们能搞定
We can handle this.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,790
不  我必须亲自去
No. I want to be there in person.

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,070
我要亲自杀了他
I want to kill him myself.

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,840
等等  那段倒回去重看一遍
Wait. Can you rewind that for me?

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
我以为我加入了重案组后
I thought I was all done mopping up bodega shootings

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,600
就不用再街杂货店打砸抢的案子了
when I joined the homicide task force.

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,120
你觉得这是抢劫案吗
This looks like a stickup job to you?

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,560
那你还是回去接着做巡警吧
Then maybe you need to go back to working a precinct.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,120
歹徒没拿走钱
There was no money taken.

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,150
快速两发连射  近距离射击  凶手的目的是杀人
Double tap, close range-- this was an execution.

30
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,530
知道死者是谁了吗
We got any I.D. on the vic?

31
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,170
还不知道  但你没看到最重要的部分
Not yet, but you haven't seen the best part.

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,630
重放一遍
Rewind it again.

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,800
有个目击者
We got ourselves a witness.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,030
-找到他了吗  -我派了人
- Any sign of him? - I put out a bolo.

35
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,280
排查了方圆里六个街区
Had a team canvass a six-block radius.

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,270
那家伙消失了
Guy vanished.

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,680
换我也会吓得藏起来
I'd make myself scarce too.

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,910
你可不想在这一带的人当做是告密者
This ain't no neighborhood you want to be called a snitch.

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,350
-可不是  - 警探...
- No, it's not. - Detective...

40
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,160
外面围着一群记者想知道内部消息
Got a bunch of reporters out there begging me for scraps.

41
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,350
我怎么跟他们说
What do I tell them?

42
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,210
让他们去找公关组的人
Send them to the task force P.R. guy.

43
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,680
-让他去应付  -好的  长官
- Let him deal with them. - Yes, ma'am.

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,310
舍曼斯基探员  集团犯罪科的
Detective Szymanski, organized crime,

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,320
-这位是弗斯科探员  -幸会
- This is detective Fusco. - Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,820
这是黑帮干的吗
Was this a mob hit?

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,090
死者是"我们的家"的前任副手
The victim's a former "la cosa nostra" lieutenant

48
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,200
名叫本尼・达格斯蒂诺
By the name of Benny d'Agostino.

49
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,860
他很久不混这个圈子了
He was out of the game for a couple of years,

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,960
但六个月前他又开始活跃了
and then he popped up again on our radar about six months ago.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
布莱顿海滩是俄罗斯黑帮的地盘
Brighton beach is Russian territory.

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,030
"我们的家"的人跑来干嘛
So what's the l.C.N. doing here?

53
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,160
你不知道吗  这儿马上要开战了
You kidding? There's a war going on.

54
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,030
上周以来有一半俄罗斯黑帮的元老
Half a dozen V.I.P.S. in the Russian mob

55
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,200
都被清理了
were taken out last month.

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
听说幕后黑手是本尼的老大
Word is Benny's boss ordered the hits.

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,970
-他要来复仇  -他老大是谁
- This was retribution. - So who's his boss?

58
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,970
我们知道的不多
We don't know much...

59
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,260
只知道他叫以利亚
Other than a name-- Elias.

60
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,610
你听过吗
You heard of him?

61
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,350
太听过了  我们是老相识了
Oh, yeah. We go way back.

62
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,250
上礼拜他的手下刚和我照过面
One of his guys took a shot at me last week.

63
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,350
这个以利亚是个狡猾的混蛋
This Elias is a clever bastard.

64
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,050
没人知道他长什么样
Nobody even knows what he looks like.

65
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,050
那个目击者呢
What about the witness?

66
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,620
你的手下找到他了吗
Your boys have any luck finding him?

67
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,440
没有  不过再看看监控录像
No, but have another look at the surveillance footage.

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,870
死者跟目击者说了点什么
The victim said something to the witness.

69
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,500
如果这是临终遗言  他还透露了凶手的名字
If it's a dying declaration and he named the killers,

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
那也解释的通
it'd be admissible.

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,770
是的  不过我们还有个麻烦
Yeah, but we've got a problem.

72
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,040
我们亲爱的俄罗斯老板
The Russian owner of this fine establishment

73
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,740
事发当时
was on a conveniently timed smoke break

74
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,380
正好跑出去抽烟了
when all this went down.

75
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,710
他坚持说他什么也不知道
He's not giving us anything.

76
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,920
你觉得他会告诉凶手吗
You think he told the shooters we found a witness?

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
如果他说了  那俄罗斯黑帮为了找到目击者
If he did, the Russians will knock down every door

78
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,720
一定会把这一带掀个底朝天
in this neighborhood till they find him.

79
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,350
我的人会继续在这一带排查
Well, my guys are working the block.

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
-希望能查到什么  -但愿
- Something will pop. - It better.

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,270
我们得赶在俄国人之前找到他
We got to get to this witness before the Russians do.

82
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,230
我昨晚收到了他的号码
I received his number late last night.

83
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,470
他叫查理・伯顿
His name is Charlie Burton.

84
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,320
他看上去很不安
The guy is worried about something.

85
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,570
但我暂时没发现威胁
I'm not seeing a threat yet.

86
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,640
他是什么情况  芬奇
What's his story, Finch?

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
他是个高中历史老师
He's a high-school history teacher

88
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,610
在布莱顿海滩区的中学教书
working in the Brighton Beach school district.

89
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,950
独居  从没结过婚
Lives alone, never married--

90
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,120
没有其他的了
not much to go on.

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,620
没准有学生在追杀他
Well, maybe a student's after him.

92
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,050
你懂  教书可是个很危险的职业
You know, teaching can be a dangerous profession.

93
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,760
是呀  我觉得当间谍要安全多了
Yes, I imagine espionage was a much safer choice,

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,540
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese.

95
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,230
你好  莱奈尔
Hello, Lionel.

96
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,930
我不清楚你平时是怎么工作的
I'm not sure how you usually do what you do,

97
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,500
但我正在找一个人  需要你的帮助
But I'm looking for a guy, and I could use some help.

98
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,940
他是个目击者  目击了俄罗斯帮派的枪杀
He's a witness, saw a Russian mob hit go down.

He's caucasian, 5'10", bald.

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,380
在班上不是那种起眼的类型
Probably not the most popular guy in his class,

101
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,450
你懂的吧
If you know what I mean.

102
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,730
我们得找到他
We need to find him.

103
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,420
我想我已经找到了
I think I already did.

104
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,120
为啥我一点都不惊讶
Why am I not surprised?

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,550
听着  不管谁是凶手
Listen, whoever did this hit,

106
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,140
他们肯定会去找他
They're gonna come looking for him.

107
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,430
他们已经来找他了
They've already found him.

108
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,130
里瑟先生...
Mr. Reese...

109
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,300
我们把这个问题交给执法机关解决吧
We might want to leave this one to the authorities.

110
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,650
来不及了  我立刻行动
No time. I'm heading in.

111
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,610
封锁出口
Cover the exits.

112
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,260
其余的跟我来

Get out of my apartment.

伯顿先生  你有危险
Mr. Burton, you're in danger.

123
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,910
杂货店的那伙人来找你了
The men from the bodega are here.

124
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,840
你怎么知道  他们派你来的吗
Now, how do you know about that? Did they send you?

125
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,910
先生  现在有一票俄罗斯杀手逼近了
Sir, you have a Russian hit team closing in,

126
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,380
在你做决定之前
Which leaves us with approximately five seconds

127
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,210
我们大概还有五秒钟时间
before you need to make a decision.

128
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,550
我怎么知道你跟他们不是一伙
How do I know you're not one of them?

129
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,350
因为我都站在你眼前了
Because I'm standing in front of you

130
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,180
你还好端端地活着
And you're still alive.

131
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,600
看来我别无选择了
Doesn't seem like I've got a choice.

132
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,450
那傻逼跑哪儿去了
Where did this piece of garbage go?

133
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,930
我原路返回找
I'll double back.

134
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,180
里瑟先生  你能安全撤退吗
Mr. Reese, can you get out?

135
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,420
需要我报警吗
Do you need me to call in a distraction?

136
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,630
我回头再打给你  快来
Let me get back to you on that. Come on.

137
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
接着走
Let's get moving...

138
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,260
来
Now.

139
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,250
离开这个街区最快的方法
Okay, the fastest way out of this neighborhood

140
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,650
就是穿过这些楼
is through those buildings.

141
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,060
啥  你开玩笑呢吧
What, are you joking?

142
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,120
连俄国佬都不去乱闯那栋廉价房
Even the Russians don't go into the Double "B"s.

143
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,990
那是保加利亚毒贩的地盘
A bulgarian drug dealer runs the place.

144
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,810
芬奇  我需要另一条撤离路线
Okay, Finch, I'm gonna need another route out of here.

145
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,270
现在咱们孤立无援了  我要用你的手机
We're on our own. I need your cell phone.

146
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,720
我这人不用手机
I don't believe in them.

147
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,720
里瑟先生  听得到吗
Mr. Reese, can you hear me?

148
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,590
喂  这不是我的车
Hey, this isn't mine!

149
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,340
也不是我的  上车
Not mine either. Get in.

150
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,890
在咱们一块因为偷车入狱之前
May I at least have your name

151
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,630
至少告诉我你叫啥吧
Before we commit grand theft auto together?

152
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,200
首先  我们得把你弄到警察局去
First, we need to get you to the police,

153
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,330
把你在杂货店里看到的都告诉他们
So you can tell them about what you saw at the bodega.

154
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,730
俄罗斯黑帮在追杀我  老兄
The Russian mob is after me, friend.

155
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,140
他们在局里有眼线
They've got people on the inside.

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,640
我说了就死定了
If I testify, I'm dead.

157
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,670
我认识一个信得过的警探
I know a detective we can trust.

158
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,910
不过我们得先把你送到河对岸的曼哈顿去
But we need to get you across the river to Manhattan.

159
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,690
趴下
Get down!

160
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,290
我们得快走了
We need to keep moving.

161
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,020
这有点小麻烦了
That's going to be a problem.

162
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,520
你说俄国佬从不敢进去吗
You say the Russians don't go in there?

163
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,470
那我们进去
Well, that's where we're going.

164
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,850
我没说错吧
See what I mean?

165
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,080
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

166
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,600
我还不知道你是谁
I still don't even know who you are.

167
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,970
我提供帮助
I help people.

168
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,400
你需要帮助
And you need help.

169
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,040
好吧
Well...

170
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,180
子弹直接穿过去了
Bullet went straight through clean--

171
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,010
没伤到骨头
No bone damage.

172
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,750
不过还是得清理一下伤口以防感染
But we need to get you cleaned up before it gets infected.

173
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,140
附近有药房吗
You see a pharmacy nearby?

174
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,760
你昨晚在杂货店看到的事情
The men you saw last night at the bodega...

175
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,140
你认识他们吗
what can you tell me about them?

176
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,420
这有什么区别
What difference does it make?

177
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,490
我想我得对想杀我的人
I guess I like to know a little bit about the guys

178
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,640
有点了解
who are shooting at me.

179
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,970
我加班到晚上  一直在批改作业
I worked through dinner, and I was grading papers.

180
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,340
回家路上在一家商店逗留了一下
And I stopped at the store on my way home.

181
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,190
我在犹豫是买蔬菜通心粉汤还是买豌豆汤
I couldn't decide between minestrone and split pea.

182
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,480
突然看到几个拿枪的人  我就躲起来了
And then I saw the guys with guns, and I hid.

183
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
你看到他们的脸了吗
Did you see their faces?

184
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,800
他们戴了面具
They had masks.

185
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,290
可有个人取下了面具
But one of them lifted his,

186
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,550
好像他故意让那个人看清他的脸
like he wanted that guy to see his face.

187
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,920
他们杀的那个人
But that guy they killed...

188
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,860
说他有口信要告诉个叫以利亚的人
He said he had a message for someone named Elias.

189
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,800
他想让我去帮他捎口信  可我不认识以利亚
And he wanted me to give it to him, but I don't know an Elias.

190
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,440
我跟他说了我不认识
I tried to tell him that.

191
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,770
伯顿先生  你让你带什么口信
Mr. Burton, what was the message?

192
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,410
我听不懂  和维尼有关的什么事
I didn't understand it-- something about Vinnie.

193
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,020
维尼会帮他完成工作
Vinnie was gonna finish the job for him.

194
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,940
你为什么不报警
Why didn't you call the police?

195
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,610
这片街区的规矩你不懂
You don't understand this neighborhood, do you?

196
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,920
找警察就像是赌轮盘
Going to the cops here is like playing Russian roulette.

197
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,090
你不知道哪个警察是他们的人
You don't know which side they're on.

198
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,490
我一个学生的父母去年报了警
One of my students' parents filed a police report last year.

199
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,130
结果就出了事故
Then he got into an accident.

200
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,830
到现在还在靠吸管进食
He's still eating through a straw.

201
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,130
我认识个可以信任的警官
I'll get you to a police officer you can trust.

202
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,700
我会闭紧嘴巴
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut

203
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,000
但愿事情就这么过去了
and hope it all blows over.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,670
我也不知  这帮人看起来很生气
I don't know. These guys look pretty upset.

205
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,840
我要是去作证了
If I testify...

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,840
我就再也回不来了
I never get to come back here.

207
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,540
我那么努力地工作
And I've worked too hard.

208
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,160
这里就是我的家
This is my home.

209
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,150
至少为了我的学生  我不能离开他们
My students, for starters-- I-I can't leave them.

210
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,350
他们需要我
They need me.

211
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,660
你要是死了  伯顿先生
Well, you won't do those kids any good

212
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,500
学生们可就更指望不上你了
if you're dead, Mr. Burton.

213
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,930
叫我查理  学生才叫我伯顿先生
Charlie, please-- "Mr. Burton" Is for my students.

214
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,400
你想死吗  查理
Do you want to die, Charlie?

215
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,570
这可不是历史课
Because this isn't a history lesson.

216
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,050
这是真刀真枪
Those bullets are real.

217
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,020
我叫约翰
My name is John.

218
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,660
多谢你救我一命  约翰
Thank you for saving my ass, John.

219
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,780
多谢你来这一趟  帕蒂
Thanks for coming down, Patti.

220
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,370
对你丈夫的去世表示遗憾
We're all very sorry for your loss.

221
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,500
你才不遗憾  你恨透我丈夫了
You're not sorry. You hated my husband.

222
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,740
不  我只是恨他做的事
No, I only hated what he did for a living.

223
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,370
夫人
Ma'am...

224
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,080
你知不知道本尼昨晚为什么去布莱顿海滩
Do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?

225
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,590
他在那边是不是有生意上的事
Was he--I don't know-- conducting business?

226
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,920
达格斯蒂诺夫人
Mrs. D'agostino...

227
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,190
我明白你此时心中的愤怒
I know that anger you're feeling right now--

228
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,590
失去所爱的人是种什么感受
What it's like to lose someone you love.

229
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,530
帮我们抓住杀害你丈夫的人
Help us find the men who did this to your husband.

230
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,660
你们能不能找到他们无所谓
It doesn't matter if you find them.

231
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,560
Elias会找到他们
Elias will.

232
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,630
他会杀光每一个俄国混蛋
And he'll kill each and every single one of those russian bastards.

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,570
以利亚挑起了这场战争  可是他赢不了
Elias started a war that can't be won.

234
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,740
要是继续这样  很多无辜的人会送命
Now, a lot of innocent people are gonna die if this continues.

235
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,580
-你希望这样吗  -如果有必要的话
- Do you want that? - If that's what it takes.

236
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,120
他在哪儿  帕蒂
Where is he, Patti?

237
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,820
以利亚在哪
Where is Elias?

238
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,850
我从没见过他
I never met him.

239
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,620
他的手下也从不抛头露面
And his crew... they don't socialize.

240
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,390
所以你们永远找不到他
That's why you'll never find him.

241
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,530
我有一点疑惑
I'm a little confused.

242
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,400
为什么以利亚这么想得到布莱顿海滩
Why does Elias want Brighton Beach so bad?

243
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,770
你根本毫无头绪
You're not seeing it.

244
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,300
布莱顿海滩只是个开始
Brighton Beach is just the beginning.

245
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,170
以利亚有更宏大的计划
Elias has bigger plans.

246
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,340
他将会联合五大家族
He'll reunite the five families

247
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,680
肃清这帮俄国人渣
and take out the Russian trash.

248
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,980
当他大功告成时
And then when he's finished,

249
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,830
你们都将听命于他
you people will be answering to him.

250
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,170
五六个持有重型火力的人
Five or six heavily armed men were chasing a guy

251
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,500
在追一个符合我们目击者外貌的人
matching the description of our witness.

252
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,870
他名叫查理・伯顿
His name's Charlie Burton, by the way.

253
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,570
那家杂货店每个月给他送两次货
Found out he had groceries delivered twice a month from the bodega,

254
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,740
他不是一个人在逃命
And he wasn't dodging bullets by himself.

255
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,210
-他跟谁在一起  -一个高个西装男
- Who was he with? - Some tall guy in a suit--

256
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,580
绝对不是和俄国人一伙的
Definitely not with the Russians.

257
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,480
逃走前打中了一个俄国人的膝盖
Shot one of them in the knee before they got away.

258
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,020
怎么  你认识他
What? You know him?

259
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,550
这人我追踪了有一阵子了
It's just someone I've been tracking for a while.

260
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,590
我遇上的最厉害的  有军事背景
Best I've got, he's former military--

261
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,920
十足的麻烦
a pain in the ass.

262
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,090
他俩有人中弹吗
Either one of them get hit?

263
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,660
似乎交火很激烈啊
There seems to be an awful lot of shots fired.

264
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,230
他们似乎平安逃脱了    
Looks like they got off okay.

265
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,200
一个俄国流氓被送进了医院  不过不肯开口
I got a russian thug in the hospital who isn't talking,

266
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,400
不过我们有街对面ATM机上的摄像头
But we got an ATM camera across the street.

267
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,670
或许能帮我们理清点头绪
That might help shed some light on things.

268
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,870
我得花两周弄到搜查证才能看到录像
It'll take two weeks and a warrant to get the footage.

269
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,550
幸运的是  一个路人给我们提供了她的录像
Thankfully, a bystander got some footage of her own.

270
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,110
这是彼得・约格洛夫
Meet Peter Yogorov.

271
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,410
和俄国黑帮老大伊万・约格洛夫是什么关系
As in Ivan Yogorov, the Russian boss?

272
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,580
彼得是他儿子
Peter's his son.

273
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,810
-警官  -是
- Yo, officer. - Yeah.

274
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,250
打给第八分局
Call over to the 8th.

275
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,390
叫他们找出任何与伊万・约格洛夫有关的文件
Tell them to pull any file we have pertaining to Ivan Yogorov.

276
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,050
伊万・约格洛夫  好的
Ivan Yogorov-- got it.

277
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,220
里瑟先生  你在哪儿
Where are you, Mr. Reese?

278
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,750
这些人是谁
Who are these guys?

279
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,230
这个警察和他们在一起干什么
And what's this cop doing with them?

280
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,060
纽约警局
N.Y.P.D.

281
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,720
-弗斯科警探  -警探你好
-Detective Fusco. - Hello, Detective.

282
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,160
我得和你谈谈我们共同的朋友
I need to talk to you about our mutual friend.

283
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,890
你是谁
Who's this?

284
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,490
我们共同的朋友是谁
And who the hell is our mutual friend?

285
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,570
提示一下  有一次你要带他去牡蛎湾
I seem to recall you were going to take him to oyster bay once upon a time.

286
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,730
你是他的手下吗
So you're his guy?

287
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,800
不  警探  你才是他的手下
No, Detective. I think that's your role.

288
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,110
我跟他失去了联系
I've lost contact with him.

289
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,240
你知道他和那个目击者在哪儿吗
Do you have any idea where he and the witness are now?

290
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,810
布莱顿海滩的某处
Yeah, somewhere in Brighton Beach.

291
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,580
俄国人在光天化日之下朝他们开火了
The Russians opened fire on them in broad daylight.

292
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,110
这种情况下他俩跑不远
Those two are going nowhere fast with this type of heat on them.

293
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,680
不幸的是  俄国黑帮
Unfortunately, the Russian mafia

294
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,180
恐怕不是我们唯一的麻烦
May not be our only problem.

295
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,290
我要你帮我查一个牌照
I need you to run a license plate for me.

296
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,590
好的  伙计  我会帮你
Yeah, sure, pal. I'll help you out...

297
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,660
只要你告诉我这究竟是怎么回事
If you can tell me what the hell it is I'm doing.

298
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,130
和你的案子有关  你知道这些就够了
It relates to your case. That's all you need to know.

299
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,900
TNF0818
"Tnf0818."

300
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,700
要是有我们朋友的消息
If I hear anything about our friend,

301
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,870
我怎么联系你
How do I get in touch with you?

302
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,240
你不用找我  我会找到你
You don't. I'll find you, detective.

303
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,870
告诉你  我能解决这家伙
I'm telling you, I winged the guy.

304
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,370
咱们进去结果了他
Let's get in there and finish him off.

305
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,040
拉斯洛  等等  我们得给爸爸打电话
Laszlo, wait up. We need to call papa, regroup.

306
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,050
你就这么在外面等着吗
You want to wait around out here?

307
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,380
好吧  我进去
Fine. I'm going in.

308
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,120
你想给保加利亚人的弹弓打吗
You want to go at it with a bunch of Bulgarian tweakers?

309
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,420
我们之前有协议
We made a deal--

310
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,400
井水不犯河水
They stay out of our territory. We stay out of theirs.

311
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,720
看住所有出口
Cover every exit.

312
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,510
那两个人想出来必须经过我们
No way those two get out without going past us first.

313
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,240
我要你保持清醒  查理
I need you to stay awake, charlie.

314
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,480
我可不希望你休克了
I don't want you to go into shock.

315
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,380
你究竟是怎么干上现在这一行的  约翰
So how did you wind up doing whatever it is you do, john?

316
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,700
事情  很复杂
It's... Complicated.

317
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,400
你呢
What about you?

318
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,060
你早就立志做老师吗
Did you always want to be a teacher?

319
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,440
不  我换了很多职业
No, it was sort of a career shift.

320
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,300
我很喜欢孩子
I came to like the kids a lot.

321
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,830
很多孩子的家长和俄国黑帮有联系
A lot of their parents are affiliated with the russian mob,

322
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,870
我希望给他们另外指一条路
So I try to give them other options.

323
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,950
他们有你真是福气
They're lucky to have you.

324
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,380
只有那些被我救了  进了大学的而已
Only the ones that I get out of the life and into college.

325
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,210
那没被救的呢
What about the kids who don't make it?

326
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,600
大概就成了追杀我们的人了
Probably the ones shooting at us.

327
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,660
哪儿也别去
Don't go anywhere.

328
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,730
什么  等等  你去哪
What? Wait. Where--where are you going?

329
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,310
去找个药店
To find us a pharmacy.

330
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,480
你该注意一下
You should be careful

331
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,980
你的胆固醇摄入量了  警探
About your cholesterol intake, detective.

332
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,190
怎么  我们在约会吗
What, are we dating?

333
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,580
弄到我要的情报了吗
Do you have the information I asked you for?

334
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,880
原来你才是老板啊
You're the boss, huh?

335
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,700
电话那一头的神秘男声
The voice on the other end of the phone?

336
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,790
车牌登记在市中心一家皮包公司名下
The plate's registered to a shell corp in midtown.

337
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,260
查不下去了
It's a dead end.

338
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,390
我问你件事
Hey, let me ask you something.

339
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,760
你们到底在追查谁  朋友的朋友先生
Who are you trying to track down, "Mr. Friend of a friend"?

340
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,130
除了俄国人  还有别的犯罪集团
The russians aren't the only criminal operation

341
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,500
在找查理・伯顿
Looking for charlie burton.

342
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,870
你是说这个车牌是以利亚的吗
You saying this plate belongs to Elias?

343
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,300
有可能  你在你的报告里提过
Maybe. You mentioned in your report

344
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,870
被害人死前和伯顿先生说过话
That the victim spoke to mr. Burton before he expired.

345
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,370
什么意思  你读过我的报告
Whoa. What do you mean? You read my report?

346
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,440
-你怎么能读到我的报告  -这无关紧要  弗斯科先生
- How did you read my report? - doesn't matter, mr. Fusco.

347
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,350
重要的是本尼想传达什么讯息
What matters is that whatever message benny was passing along,

348
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,560
这对以利亚很重要
It means a great deal to elias.

349
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,220
你的意思是  俄国人想杀这个可怜虫
so you're telling me the russians want

350
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,600
因为他目击了本尼被杀
The poor bastard dead because he witnessed them taking out benny.

351
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,690
而以利亚也想杀他
And elias wants him dead

352
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,670
因为他认为他手上有重要的情报
Because he thinks he has sensitive information.

353
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,790
-他可真倒霉  -是啊
- Not his lucky day, is it? - indeed.

354
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,560
我要你上报这辆车被盗
That car-- I need you to report it stolen,

355
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,620
然后把报告发到这个电子邮箱
Then email the report number to that address.

356
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,440
你有咱们共同朋友的消息吗
Hey, you heard from our mutual friend?

357
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,870
怎么  你担心起他来了  警探
What, are you worried about him, detective?

358
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,370
只是比较好奇
Let's go with curious.

359
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,690
没有
No.

360
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,240
没他的消息
No word from him.

361
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,320
我今天做的几乎有昨天两倍多
I made almost twice what I did yesterday.

362
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,850
你做的还是没我多
You still ain't made more than me.

363
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,600
伙计们  我能借点毒品吗
Hello, fellas. Can I borrow some of your drugs?

364
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,700
放松点  我不是来打架
oh, no. Easy, fella. I'm not looking for a fight.

365
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,350
看来你是免不了一顿打了
Looks like you found one anyway.

366
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,910
别这样
Don't do it.

367
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,920
我警告你
I'm telling you, now.

368
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,540
谢谢
Thank you.

369
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,580
既然伊万的儿子们卷入了这件事
If ivan's sons are involved in this,

370
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,180
杂货店里的可能就是他本人
Could be the man himself was at the bodega--

371
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,820
亲自为他兄弟复仇
Avenge his brother's death in person.

372
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,250
以利亚的手下两周前杀了他
Elias' crew took him out last week,

373
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,490
还有十几个其他俄国杀手
Along with a half a dozen other russian hitters.

374
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,930
我以为俄国黑帮在布莱顿海滩没人敢动
I thought the russians were untouchable in brighton beach.

375
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,500
以前是  不知以利亚哪里来的情报
They were. No one knows where elias gets his information.

376
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,830
他总能抢在对手和我们前面
He's always one step ahead of all of them...and us.

377
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,670
我还弄不明白
What I still don't get is why elias

378
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,950
为什么以利亚要争夺布莱顿海滩
Is trying to make a move for brighton beach.

379
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,040
1973年有个叫玛琳・以利亚的女人被谋杀了
A woman named Marlene Elias was murdered in 1973.

380
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,310
她跟唐・莫雷蒂有个私生子
She had an illegitimate son with Don Moretti.

381
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,660
我认为以利亚就是唐的儿子
I think Elias is the Don's kid.

382
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,620
莫雷蒂被关押之前
Last place Moretti ran

383
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,650
最后的地盘就是布莱顿海滩
Before he got locked up was Brighton Beach.

384
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,420
所以唐的私生子就回来清场  
So the Don's bastard son came back to clean up?

385
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,600
夺回本属于他的一切
Claim his birthright?

386
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,270
那是什么
What is that?

387
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,500
可卡因
Cocaine.

388
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,020
我想凡事总是会有第一次吧
I guess there's a first time for everything.

389
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,580
这是胶水
Is that glue?

390
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,510
是
Yeah.

391
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,280
没什么比两毛五分一瓶的胶水
Nothing like over-the-counter polymer

392
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,910
能更快地愈合伤口的了
To close a wound in a pinch.

393
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,250
你们超人预备班都教这些东西
You learn all this in hero training?

394
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,890
差不多吧
Something like that.

395
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

396
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,290
没事
Sure.

397
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,700
不是  说真的
No, really...

398
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,030
谢谢你
Thank you.

399
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,280
如果不是你在  我估计就直接躺了
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead right now.

400
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,640
以前耍过枪没有
You ever use one of these?

401
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,210
你拿着不是更好嘛
Don't you think it would be better if you kept it?

402
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,320
总要以防万一
Well, just in case.

403
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,450
别  我上一次玩枪
No, last time I touched a gun, I shot cans

404
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,850
跟我的养父出去打易拉罐
With one of my foster dads...

405
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,020
结果意外打死一只鸟
Accidentally killed a bird--

406
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,960
不怎么好的童年回忆
Not my favorite childhood memory.

407
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,290
很简单的  你看
Simple. Look...

408
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,200
这是保险  这样上弹匣
Safety's there. Just load the magazine like this.

409
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,540
拉套筒  很简单
Rack it. Simple.

410
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,270
你真的觉得我们能从这儿出去
Do you really think we'll get out of here?

411
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,210
我们现在出去的把握可比
We have a hell of a lot better chance

412
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,660
20分钟之前的把握要大老多了
Than we did 20 minutes ago.

413
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,060
他们来了
Here they come.

414
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,190
你们是来找那些在我们楼里乱窜的人吗
You after those boys running around our building?

415
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,590
没错
That's right.

416
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,530
他从我的人手里抢了东西
He took something from my people.

417
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,090
我们不给你们麻烦  你们去做了他们
We don't give you any problems, you take 'em out?

418
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,040
成交
I can make that deal.

419
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,340
给另外一个拿一把
Give one to the other guy.

420
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,940
我们帮忙  你们会快上很多
We'll help you out a whole lot quicker.

421
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,380
有人跟我讲他们躲在四楼上
Someone told me they're hiding out on the fourth floor.

422
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,020
有个人还在流血

423
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,990
穿上这个
Put this on.

424
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,460
如果我能找到一条通的电话线
If I can find a line that's still operating,

425
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,210
我们就能打电话
We can make a call.

426
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,140
我以为只有我还在用座机打电话
Wow, I thought I was the only one who still had a hard line.

427
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,180
我还希望这栋楼里的人都能像你一样
I was hoping there was someone in this building

428
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,980
那么传统  查理
As old-fashioned as you, Charlie.

429
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,380
很抱歉把你给牵扯进来了
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

430
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,690
没事  我就干这个
It's okay. It's my job.

431
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,690
干这行可不安全
It's a dangerous career choice.

432
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,560
这话我今天是第二次听了
That's the second time today I've heard that.

433
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,140
有意思  你让我想到他了
It's funny. You remind me of him.

434
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,050
芬奇  我刚就在跟人说你
Finch... I was just talking about you.

435
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,600
你在哪  里瑟先生
Where are you, Mr. Reese?

436
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,750
廉价房规划区
The double "B" Housing projects--

437
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,460
四楼  北楼
Fourth floor, north tower.

438
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,090
给我找条出去的路  芬奇
Find me a way out of here, Finch--

439
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,590
一条别人都不会走的路
One that no one else will use.

440
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,110
城市规划局应该有蓝图
City planning office should have old blueprints.

441
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,530
伯顿先生状况如何
How is Mr. Burton faring?

442

受了伤但是命够硬
He's wounded but stubborn.

443
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,300
他能挺过去
He'll pull through.

444
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,040
俄国人不是唯一在追杀他的人
The Russians aren't the only ones after him.

445
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,980
我认为以利亚也在找他
I think Elias is looking for him too.

446
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,310
两条施工通道
Two service entrances--

447
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,100
离你最近的那条在东北边的走廊
The one closest to you is in the northeast corridor.

448
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,760
-能过去吗  -别无选择
 - Can you make it there?  - We've got no choice.

449
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,890
告诉弗斯科早上七点11号码头见
Tell Fusco to meet us at pier 11 at 7:00 A.M.

450
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,130
我们会去乘河东渡轮
We'll be on the East River Ferry.

451
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,730
小心点  里瑟先生
Be careful, Mr. Reese.

452
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,780
走吧
Come on.

453
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,440
走到下个走廊后就到施工用楼梯了
Service stairs should be around the next corridor.

454
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,770
眼睛擦亮点  哪里都有可能藏人
Keep your eyes open. They could be anywhere.

455
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,080
我看他们往这边走了
Hey, I think they went this way.

456
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,360
-现在怎么办  -在这等
- What now? - Wait here.

457
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,200
是谁
Who's there?

458
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,040
去那边看看
Check down that way.

459
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,960
-伯顿先生  -威尔
- Mr. Burton?  - Will?

460
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,500
你们在这做什么
What are you doing?

461
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,800
你好  威尔
Hey, Will.

462
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,870
为了抄近路走了进来  结果我们
Came in looking for a shortcut, and we just, uh...

463
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,310
顺便说下  这位是我朋友
This is my friend, by the way.

464
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,680
我们迷路了
We just got lost.

465
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,710
去南边看看
Check the south side.

466
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,580
来吧  我爸爸不在家
Come on. My dad's not home.

467
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,460
你们能进来避避
You can hide in here.

468
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,910
机动车寻回中心
Vehicle Recovery Services.

469
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,720
你好  我是弗斯科警探  警号7645
Yeah, this is Detective Fusco, shield number 7645.

470
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,850
我正在开启一辆遭窃车辆的追踪器
I'm trying to turn on the locator in a stolen vehicle.

471
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,460
报告编号为
Uh, report number is...

472
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,960
L 377
Lima 377.

473
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,790
谢谢  警探  有什么可以效劳
Thank you, Detective. How can I help you?

474
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,100
麻烦你开启车辆的GPS跟踪器
Yeah, could you turn on the car's G.P.S. Locator

475
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,500
以及车内话筒
And the microphone?

476
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,050
当然可以  请稍等
Of course. Bear with me, please.

477
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,510
我以为你跟你爸爸早就搬出去了
I thought you and your dad moved out of here.

478
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,420
还没有  他说一找到工作就马上搬
Not yet. He said we will as soon as he gets a job.

479
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,910
是啊  现在世道不太好
Yeah, times are tough right now.

480
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,820
我相信他很快就能找到
I'm sure he'll get one soon.

481
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,030
只是别搬出我学校的学区之外去了  好吗
Just don't move out of my school district, okay?

482
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,470
-你做作业了  -都做完了
 - You did your homework? - Yep. All of it.

483
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,060
-你怎么看  -埃德蒙很不错
- What did you think? - Edmond's cool--

484
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,060
《基督山伯爵》男主人公

485
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,930
他是个幸存者  知道吗
A survivor, you know?

486
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,200
尽管他完成了他的复仇
Even though he got his revenge,

487
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,650
却还是躲不开那些不幸
Some bad stuff still stuck with him.

488
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
你是个聪明的孩子  威尔
Yeah, you're a smart kid, Will.

489
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,110
你就是得多来上课
You just need to show up to class more.

490
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,310
我是有努力
I'm trying.

491
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,620
我们每个人都得努力吧
That's all any of us can do, right?

492
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,280
丧尸
Zombies?

493
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,540
它们会占领全宇宙
They're taking over the universe.

494
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,860
嗯  决不能让它们得逞
Yeah, can't have that.

495
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,580
你是谁
Who are you?

496
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,350
你就是那个警察
You're that cop.

497
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,240
听说俄国人在廉价房里
Word is the Russians are inside the double "B"s.

498
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,890
我们得抢先一步找到他们
We better get to them first.

499
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,640
那是不是你  以利亚
Is that you, Elias?

500
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,420
开门  不然我们就进去了
Open up, or we're coming in.

501
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,420
你们想干嘛
What do you want?

502
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,690
小伙子啊  你一个人在家
Hey, little man. You all alone in there?

503
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,090
你说呢
What's it look like?

504
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,290
干嘛不让我进去看看  确认一下
Why don't you let me in, so I can make sure?

505
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,060
我爸爸教我
My papa taught me better

506
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,230
不要随便给陌生人开门
Than to let strangers inside our place,

507
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,940
尤其是出来混的
Especially punks.

508
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,090
-是吗  -就是
- Is that right? - That's right.

509
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,210
他还说盗亦有道  要彼此互相尊重
He also said that vory are supposed to show respect

510
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,540
才行
To one another.

511
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,720
你爸爸是个聪明人
Your papa's a smart man.

512
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,470
好好看家  小朋友
You be good, kid.

513
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,790
谢谢  威尔
Thanks, Will.

514
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,070
小意思  伯顿先生
It's all good, Mr. Burton.

515
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,560
你是我最好的老师
You're the best teacher I've got.

516
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,900
查理
Charlie...

517
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,680
你还能走到施工用楼梯去么
Can you make it to the service stairs?

518
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,980
我可以试试  但止疼药好像药效过了
I'll try, but the painkiller sort of wore off.

519
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,150
你们干嘛不走老的入口走道
Why don't you just use the old entrance?

520
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,980
几年前他们就关掉了施工楼梯
They closed it down a few years ago.

521
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,220
-台阶都烂掉了  -那走道在哪
- The stairs got all rotted. - Where is it?

522
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,320
就在走廊那边
It's--it's down the hall.

523
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,960
就从你们来的方向走回去就是
It's back the way that you came.

524
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,210
谢谢
Thanks.

525
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,350
走吧
Come on.

526
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,400
我欠你个人情
I owe you one.

527
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,540
那明天见了  伯顿先生
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Burton.

528
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,510
好  我们明天见
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.

529
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,660
你们查过走廊了吗
You... did you guys get that hallway?

530
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,110
我们走
Let's go.

531
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,940
开门  否则我们自己进去
Open up, or we're coming in.

532
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,530
有人吗
Hello?

533
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,240
有人在家吗
Anyone home?

534
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,840
别躲了
Can't hide forever.

535
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,860
不管怎么躲  我们都会把你们找出来
Wherever you are, we're gonna find you.

536
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,690
然后你们就玩完了
And then we're gonna end you.

537
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,330
走吧  我们继续搜
Come on. Let's keep moving.

538
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,360
小朋友你掉队咯
Looks like you got left behind.

539
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,440
今晚老夫
How can I help

540
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,340
有什么能帮到两位纽约市警局的贵客
The New York City Police Department tonight?

541
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,850
我们是来找你儿子彼得了解
Your son Peter's wanted for questioning

542
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,910
本尼・达格斯蒂诺谋杀案的有关情况
In the murder of Benny D'Agostino.

543
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,620
知道我们上哪去找他吗
Know where we might find him?

544
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,090
-那个本尼是谁  -省省吧  伊万
- Who is this Benny? - Come on, Ivan.

545
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,790
据我们了解本尼是杀害
We heard Benny was the trigger man

546
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,120
你兄弟的凶手
In your brother's murder.

547
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,760
我们也知道杂货店那件事是报复
And we know the Bodega run was payback.

548
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
你们看来知道很多
You seem to know a lot

549
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,130
根本不用到我这里来问问题嘛
For someone who is here to ask me questions.

550
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,330
约格洛夫先生  我们不想要再多的血腥了
Mr. Yogorov, we don't want any more bloodshed.

551
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,870
彼得今天一天都在这里工作
My Peter was here working all day long.

552
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,600
他去储藏室为今晚的宴会
He's at the storage getting more wine

553
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,610
挑酒去了
For an event tonight.

554
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,540
恕我直言  先生
With all due respect, Sir,

555
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,480
你并不怎么适合给你儿子做不在场证明 
You may not be the best person to give your son an alibi.

556
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,350
如果你们来是为了给彼得按罪名的话
If you are here to accuse my Peter of something,

557
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,220
我建议你们去拿个逮捕令再来
I suggest you come back with a warrant...

558
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,020
前提还得是你们能弄到
If you can get one.

559
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,420
伊万  这场战争没有赢家
There are no winners in this war, Ivan--

560
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,320
只会死人
Only dead soldiers.

561
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,240
你是不是准备连你的儿子们都要葬送掉
Are you ready to lose your sons too?

562
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,800
假设我知道你们所说的是什么事情
If I knew to what you were referring,

563
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,170
我敢说这个所谓的战争
I'd say that this so-called war

564
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,400
也是那个孬种以利亚挑起来  不是我
Was started by this coward Elias, not me.

565
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,170
他才是那个到我的地盘上来撒野的人
He's the one who comes to my neighborhood...

566
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,580
偷我的东西  还杀我的人
Stealing from me, killing my people...

567
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,190
不是我
Not the other way around.

568
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,700
失陪了  我还要去主持宴会
Now, if you excuse me, I have an event to host.

569
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,870
请吧
Please.

570
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,970
不介意我借用一下吧
Mind if I borrow this for a moment?

571
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,820
去死吧你
Screw you.

572
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,010
用这种语气对劫匪说话可不明智啊  拉斯洛
It's a bad move to insult your hostage taker, Laszlo.

573
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,840
闭上你的嘴  不然我让你永远没法说话
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it permanently.

574
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,450
走
Let's go.

575
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,480
芬奇  是我
Finch, it's me.

576
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,750
通知卡特  杂货店的枪手
Get word to Carter that her bodega shooters

577
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,450
就在廉价房里
are inside the Double"B"s.

578
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,200
没问题
Of course.

579
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,090
我会确保让弗斯科警探
And I'll make sure detective Fusco meets you

580
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,270
在码头同你和证人碰头
And the witness at the ferry.

581
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,480
你先走
You first.

582
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,950
-我们现在去哪  -渡河
- Where are we going now? - Across the river.

583
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,030
快点  拉斯洛  快走
Come on, Laszlo, let's move.

584
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,520
刚收到短信  他往11号码头去了
Just got a text. He's heading to pier 11.

585
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,080
赶紧过去拦住他
Let's get over there to intercept him, now.

586
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,300
-干得不错啊  警探  -彼此彼此  卡特
- Nice collar, detective. - You too, Carter.

587
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,320
-知道是谁报的警吗  -当然
- You find out who called it in? - I have an idea.

588
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,750
喂  我是弗斯科
Yeah. Fusco.

589
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,320
我还以为
And I was just starting to believe

590
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,760
我们能信任你了  警探
That we could trust you, detective.

591
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,160
我很失望
I'm disappointed.

592
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,590
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

593
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,930
以利亚的人过来了
Elias' men are on their way

594
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,590
准备到码头对付我们的朋友
To meet our friends at the ferry.

595
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,660
-他们怎么知道  -我还想问你呢
- How the hell'd they find out? - I was going to ask you.

596
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,100
-你觉得是我的错吗  -不然会是谁
- You're blaming me for this? - Then who told them?

597
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,870
听着  我不可能...
Listen, there's no way I would've--

598
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,690
警探  你还在吗
Detective, are you there?

599
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,480
我把你送过河后
When we get you across the river,

600
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,950
我会把你交给我的警探朋友
I'm going to hand you off to my detective.

601
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,900
你可以信任他
Now, you can trust him.

602
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,030
查理  你必须出面作证
Charlie, I need you to testify.

603
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,260
有一件事我能确定
One thing I know for sure--

604
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,520
在经历过昨晚这么多事情后
After everything we went through last night,

605
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,760
我不能让这些混蛋再在我的城市
I don't want to see these cretins running around my town

606
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,730
横行霸道了
Ever again.

607
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,130
谢谢
Thanks.

608
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,140
你准备好招了吗
Ready to talk?

609
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,990
你准备好放我走了吗
You ready to let me go?

610
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,620
彼得  监控拍到你了
Peter, we got you on camera.

611
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,950
还有证人说
We've got witnesses that say

612
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,180
你和你兄弟在布莱顿海滩
You and your brother were shooting up the streets

613
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,430
的马路上开枪打人
In brighton beach.

614
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,470
不知道你在说什么
No idea what you're talking about.

615
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,590
多么美好的早晨啊
It's a beautiful morning.

616
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
我必须谢谢你  约翰
I have to thank you, John.

617
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,580
实话告诉你
To tell you the truth,

618
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,880
我以为自己看不到太阳了
I didn't think I'd see another one.

619
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,700
以利亚杀了你叔叔
Elias killed your uncle.

620
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,450
你和你父亲  还有你兄弟
You, your father, and your brother

621
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,460
去杂货店想找他报仇
Went to the bodega for revenge.

622
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,410
你不知道以利亚长什么样
You didn't know what Elias looked like,

623
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,810
所以他的副手  本尼・达格斯蒂诺
So his lieutenant Benny D'agostino

624
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,110
成了二号目标
Was the next best thing.

625
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,150
而现在  你又要除掉那个证人
And now you're trying to rub out the witness--

626
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,660
他看到了你父亲的脸
The guy who saw your father's face.

627
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,860
我们得到消息
We heard from a source

628
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,560
说以利亚那晚会出现在
That Elias was supposed to be at the bodega

629
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,530
-那个杂货店  -他在和本尼会面
- That night. - he was meeting Benny.

630
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,600
是的
Yeah.

631
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,360
但我们到那的时候
But when we showed up...

632
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,070
只看到本尼一个人
Benny was all we saw.

633
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,700
直到杂货店店主告诉了我们真相
Found out what really went down after the owner called us.

634
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,080
他说还有个人
He said there was another guy.

635
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,960
你算是什么人
Hey, what are you--

636
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,710
贪污的条子
Corrupt P.D.,

637
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,210
还是雇佣兵
Gun for hire?

638
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,550
那种拿人钱财
What kind of guy takes money

639
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,260
保护你主子那种人渣的人吗
To protect a scumbag like your boss here?

640
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,250
你觉得他会作证吗
You think he's going to testify...

641
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,900
在他做了那一切之后
After everything he's done?

642
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,720
他把这个地方搅得鸡犬不宁
He's tearing this town apart.

643
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,570
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

644
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,210
你不知道他是谁吧
You don't know who he is, do you...

645
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,450
也不知道他的能耐
What he's capable of?

646
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,610
你还不明白吗
You don't really get it, do you?

647
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,810
你真以为我们这么大费周章
You honestly think we'd go to all this trouble

648
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,660
只为除掉一个证人吗
For a witness?

649
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,280
你现在陷入的局面
You're in the middle of a situation

650
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,160
连你自己都没搞清楚
That you don't even understand.

651
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,230
别逼我开枪  约翰
Don't make me shoot you, John.

652
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,600
扔下枪  踢过来  拜托了
Drop your weapon and kick it to me, please.

653
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,840
我以为你不喜欢枪
I thought you didn't like guns.

654
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,770
有时候你必须做你不喜欢做的事
You know, sometimes you have to do things you don't like.

655
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,110
包括教你仇家的孩子历史吗
Like teaching history to the children of your enemies?

656
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,080
三年来  我观察着他们
Three years, I watched them--

657
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,380
教导那些猪猡人渣们的孩子
Cleaning up after the children of those pigs.

658
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,980
这些时间足够去了解
It's a good amount of time to learn

659
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,460
你的敌人最在意什么  弱点是什么
What makes your enemies tick, what makes them weak.

660
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,690
你能知道那些人们想藏起来的秘密
You know all the secrets you and your family tried to hide,

661
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,260
拉斯洛  就你的亲生骨肉告诉我的事
Laszlo, I learned all about from your own flesh and blood?

662
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,440
我知道你孩子就和我一样恨你
Your children hate you almost as much as I do.

663
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,130
把你自己绑到栏杆上  约翰
Tie yourself to the railing, John,

664
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,500
绑牢了
Nice and tight.

665
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,670
我知道你有多擅长
I know how capable you are

666
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,840
让自己脱离险境
Of getting out of difficult situations.

667
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,970
跪下
On your knees, please.

668
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,940
那天你是在杂货店和本尼碰面
You were meeting Benny at the bodega that day,

669
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,040
是吧
Weren't you?

670
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,020
那些杀手的目标是你
The shooters were looking for you.

671
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,250
是的  这是别人不知道你是谁
Yeah, the benefits of no one knowing who you are

672
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,660
或是你长什么样的好处
Or what you look like.

673
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,820
不过我想现在这个优势没了
That's gone now, I suppose.

674
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,680
是时候该转移了
It's time to evolve.

675
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,170
我已经做好下一步准备
I'm ready for the next step.

676
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,200
开枪啊
Go ahead.

677
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,300
要我看到你做我城市的老大  我宁愿死
I'd rather die than see you running my city.

678
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,530
你知道本尼死前说了什么吗
You know what Benny said before he died?

679
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,300
他说  [拉丁语][恺撒大帝的名言]
He said, "Veni, vidi, vici"--

680
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,070
"我来  我见  我征服"
I came, I saw, I won.

681
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,260
他说你们强大的俄罗斯黑帮已经不堪一击
He said your almighty Bratva was already crumbling.

682
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,310
他说我们已经胜券在握
He said we'd already won.

683
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,650
这是本尼的债
This is for Benny.

684
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,420
以利亚  要是你杀了他...
Elias, if you kill him...

685
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,050
我不会杀了他
I'm not going to kill him. -

686
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,390
我不过是传达个信息
I'm just going to send a message.

687
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,220
告诉你们老大  拉斯洛  如果他今晚滚出城
You tell your papa, Laszlo, if he gets out of town tonight,

688
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,090
我就放过他
I'll let him live.

689
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,370
布莱顿海滩现在归我了
Brighton beach belongs to me now.

690
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,070
我想过是不是要杀你  约翰
I thought about killing you, John.

691
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,440
但我觉得这样太忘恩负义了
But I realize that that would seem ungrateful.

692
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,870
况且  我怎么舍得杀死你这种人才
Besides, how do you take the life of someone so talented?

693
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,160
我需要你这样的人
I could really use a guy like you in my organization.

694
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,980
祝你好运  约翰
I wish you luck, John.

695
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,450
我们以后大可以井水不犯河水
If you stay out of my way, I'll stay out of yours.

696
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,170
不然呢
What if I don't?

697
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,270
那我们再见面时  就不会像现在这么友好了
Then we'll meet again under less pleasant circumstances.

698
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,930
你现在相信我了
You believe me now?

699
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,330
不好意思  警探
I'm sorry, detective.

700
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,150
见到你真好  莱奈尔
Nice to see you, Lionel.

701
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,120
你的犯人被绑在栏杆上呢
Your suspect is tied to the railing.

702
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,080
跟他说声不客气
Tell him "You're welcome."

703
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,970
查理的事是个意外
Couldn't have known about Charlie.

704
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,100
机器跳出了他的号码  因为他是目标
The machine found a man who was targeted for death.

705
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,980
我们只是不知道  他同时又是个杀手
We just didn't know that he was also a killer.

706
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,600
被他跑了是我的错  芬奇
It's my fault he's out there, Finch.

707
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,050
不是你一个人的错
It's not yours alone.

708
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,180
我们刚刚救的男人
We just saved a man

709
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,510
他的人生只有复仇
Whose only goal in life is revenge.

710
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,580
他花了这么多年  通过孩子
He spent years studying his enemies

711
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,180
来了解仇家的一举一动
Through their own children.

712
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,250
约翰  我们的信息不完整
John, we have limited information.

713
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,000
我们从一开始就知道  我们也可能会犯错
We knew when we began this that we might make mistakes.

714
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
但我们得走了
But we have to go now.

715
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,630
我们还要帮助更多人  还会有更多号码
We have more people to help-- more numbers.

716
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,560
又会有多少号码跳出来
and how many of those numbers will come up

717
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,390
就因为我们救了一个不该救的人
Because we saved one man's life?

718
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,790
老大
Boss...

719
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,890
完事了
It's done.

720
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,990
不  这只是个开始
No, it's just beginning.

721
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,480
我来  我见  我征服
Veni, vidi, vici.
