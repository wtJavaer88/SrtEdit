00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,600
你正被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,470
政府有一套秘密的系统
The government has a secret system...

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,860
有一台机器无时无刻不在监视着你
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,490
我知道是因为这个系统是我建的
I know,because I built it.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,630
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖行动 但事实上它可以侦测任何事
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,but it sees everything...

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,790
包括发生在平民百姓身上的暴力犯罪 像你一样的普通百姓
violent crimes involving ordinary people,people like you,

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,970
在政府看来无关紧要的暴力犯罪
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,480
他们不采取行动 所以我决定我要去干预
They wouldn't act,so I decided I would.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,480
但我需要一个搭档 某个有能力去干预的人
But I needed a partner... someone with the skills to intervene.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,650
为了躲避当局追查 我们只能秘密行动
Hunted by the authorities,we work in secret.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,400
你永远不会发现我们
You will never find us.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,710
但无论你是受害者还是罪犯 只要你的号码被选中 我们一定会找到你
But victim or perpetrator,if you're number's up,we'll find you.

14
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:55,765
我其他的西装有什么问题?
- What's wrong with my other suits?

15
00:00:55,965 --> 00:01:02,425
Reese先生 那些西装比较适合杀手 不适合这个角色
- They're fine for a hired assassin,mr. Reese,just not for this particular job.

16
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,225
我这是要去哪儿?
- Where am I going?

17
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:06,905
去和那些最优秀的最棒的打成一片
- To mingle with the best and brightest.

18
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:10,935
华尔街 我们有一个新任务了
Wall street. We have a new number.

19
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:15,835
Adam Saunders先生 他是个自营交易员 供职于Baylor Zimm投资银行
Mr. Adamaunders,he's a prop trader At the investment firm of baylor zimm.

20
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,595
- 自营交易员? - 也叫业主账户交易员
- Prop trader? - Proprietary.

21
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,635
他负责用银行自己的资金做投资 而不是用客户的资金
He invests the bank's own money,not the clients'.

22
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:26,635
他似乎是那种标准的 高学历 高收入的华尔街野心家
He seems to be your typical overeducated,overcompensated wall street highflier.

23
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,365
- 这样可以了 - 不可以
They're fine. - No.

24
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:36,285
裤脚应该正好盖住鞋帮 不能太长
The cuff should shiver on the shoe,not break.

25
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:39,045
Saunders已经和证监会有过交锋
Saunders has already had a brush with the s.E.C.,

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,535
他被怀疑在做内线交易 但无法证明
An accusation of insider trading,unproven,

27
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:46,465
所以他这样冒险 可能已经把自己置身危险中了
So his risk taking may have led him into dangerous waters.

28
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,025
我希望你可以接近他
I want you to get close to him.

29
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:51,435
我对华尔街那些一窍不通
- I don't know anything about wall street.

30
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,485

- Well,here a start,although it doesn't really matter.

31
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,485
好吧 你可以从这开始 虽然这可能派不上用场

32
00:01:54,705 --> 00:02:00,545
投行里的人只是看上去聪明 衣着光鲜 而我们已经解决后者了
Banking is mostly looking clever and wearing the right clothes,and we've managed the second part.

33
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,705
我不知道怎么会这样 不过这家伙知道太多了
- I don't know how this works,but he's seen too much.

34

不计代价 搞定他
- Whatever it takes.

37
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:25,345
我是自营交易员 不是导游
- I'm a prop trader,not a tour guide.

38
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:29,015
这可是个大客户 他给咱们带来生意 上百万的生意
- And this guy's a whale. He brings us business.It's millions.

39
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,625
如果我是客户经纪人 那正合胃口
- And that'd be great,if I handled clients,

40
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:34,005
但我只为Baylor Zimm做投资
But the only people i make money for are baylor and zimm.

41
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,595
他可不止在问我们一家投行 一定要抓住这个客户
- The amount of bank this guy's talking,it'll bleed into ours soon enough.

42
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:39,045
Sydney知道这事吗?
- Sydney know about this?

43
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,175
客户点名要你
- Said they requested you by name.

44
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,455
他们肯定觉得你业务精通
Someone must think you know what you're doing.

45
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,375
Paul 你这是在拍马屁让我感觉轻飘飘
- Look,you're backing me into a corner on this,paul.

46
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:47,685
我自己心里可有底呢
I've got my eye on a thing.

47
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,195
嘿 你以为朋友要来干嘛的?
Hey,what are friends for?

48
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:55,415
何况你都不用和那个客户碰面 只需要见他的代表 好像是资产经理
Besides,you don't even have to meet the whale,just his rep,some asset manager.

49
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:59,365
好极了 我的2天时间要交给一个 涂发蜡 穿细条纹西服的人了
- Outstanding,I'll be spending two days with hair gel and a pin -Striped suit.

00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:15,215
他还不喜欢登高
- He's also not fond of heights.

56
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,885
Reese先生 我原以为房顶只是你的地盘
I thought rooftops were your domain,mr. Reese.

57
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:20,645
你的口碑很好
- Your reputation precedes you.

58
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:24,075
我的客户在花他自己钱投资的时候 很在乎口碑

60
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:29,245

142
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:40,695

144

做功课?
- Homework?

145
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,065
你以为我们还在小学吗?
What are we,in grade school?

146

嘿 小心我的西装!

00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:10,705
嘿 Finch 这些华尔街的交易员 白天拿上百万去赌博 晚上在酒吧斗殴
hey,finch,we've got a wall street trader That gambles millions by day,fights in bars at night,

153
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,225
并且有人在调查他
And someone's tracking him.

154
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:14,575
今晚你盯着他
Stay on him tonight.

155
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,495
如果有人要对他不利 很可能会在他家里下手
If somebody goes after him,it'll likely happen at his home.

156
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:20,815
是的 可问题是他不打算回家

157
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:25,295
看起来他还要加个班

158
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:31,245
Adam和他老板的关系 比我们想像的要更进一步 Finch
Adam is closer to his boss than we thought,finch.

159
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,105
他到底是谁?
Who is this guy?

160
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,219
Adam昨晚没有回家
Adam never came home last night.

161
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:55,179
反正我都在那儿了 我就顺便复印了一下他的个人资料
Since it was there,i took the liberty of copying some of his personal records.

162
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,229
我能解答一部分疑问了
I filled in some of the gaps,not all.

163
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,719
我找到了Saunders母亲的死亡证明 那年他9岁
I do have a death certificate for saunders' mother from when he was nine.

164
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:05,409
3年后 一个叫Robert Sowoski的人 签署了他的监护文件

165
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,819

166
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:07,939
我想没有
- I guess not.

167
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:13,399
我从他的私人电脑里找到他的雇佣合同
I pulled up his employment contract from his personal computer.

168
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,019
是Sydney Baylor亲自雇佣他的
Sydney baylor hired him herself.

169
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:22,029
说不定是他们的私人关系 帮他平步青云 升到交易员的职位
Their private relationship may account for his speedy rise to a trading desk.

170
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:25,579
似乎没有睡出锦绣前程这么简单 Finch
- This looks like a little more than sleeping your way to the top,finch.

171
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,849
记录里没有别的污点

172
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,509
只不过6个月前卷入了证监会的调查

173
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:35,619
我不知道原因

174
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,489

<i>GPRS: 通用分组无线业务</i>
After a gprs reroute,no one will be listening to his calls.

178
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,729
把GPRS改到发送后 没人能监听他的电话了

179
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,789
如果有人还想听他电话 他们就必须接近他
If someone makes another attempt on his phone,they'll have to get close.

180
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,819

Paul,you got a sec?

277
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,149
嗯
- Yeah.

278
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,989
那公司 我上礼拜问过的能源公司Tritak?
- That company-- That energy company I asked you about last week,tritak?

279
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:03,219
你昨天在一世纪里最大的做空上 赚了一亿 然后今天就来问MLP?
- You made $100 million yesterday in the short of the century and you're asking about some m.L.P.?

280
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,889
- 谁在乎啊? - 那是我舅舅的钱 我在乎
Who cares? - It's my uncle's cash. I care.

281
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:08,849
所有固定收入客户都扔去买MLP了
- All the fixed -Income crowd is getting dumped into m.L.P.S.

282
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,279
稳健又无聊
It's safe,boring.

283
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,659
这不光是我舅舅 公司一半的客户也在买
- It's not just my uncle,it's half the clients at this firm,and it's half the firm.

284
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:15,209
我上礼拜查过了
I ran the numbers last week.

285
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,079
Baylor Zimm 19%的交易都在这玩意上
Baylor zimm is invested in this thing to 19%.

286
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,399
有人留意过这事吗?
Anybody even tracking that?

287
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,129
你查了客户的钱?
- You've been looking into client money?

288
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,099
你不能这么做 知道吧?
You know you can't do that,right?

289
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,139
联邦法律说你不能
Like,federally you can't.

290
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,269
这是非法的... 连我和你谈都是非法的
It's illegal... and so is this conversation.

291
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,499
谢谢你提醒
- Thanks for the tip.

292
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:35,749
嘿 不然朋友是干啥的?
- Hey,what are friends for?

293
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:39,389
- 我们晚点再谈 - 好
We'll talk later. - Yeah.

294
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:44,149
我听说今天证监会找你问话了怎么回事?
- What's this i hear about you getting questioned by the s.E.C. Today?

295
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,369
没事 还是那个Rasmussen 新一天问老问题
- It's nothing. It's the same guy,rasmussen.New day,same song.

296
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,479
别管他 我有事要找你
He's got nothing.But I need to talk to you.

297
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:53,069
你还记得有天晚上我问你那公司 Tritak?
You remember that company i asked you about the other night,Tritak?

298
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,729
不如我们把晚上谈的事留在晚上?
- How about we keep what we talk about at night,at night?

299
00:16:56,979 --> 00:17:01,479
还有证监会 记住上次我们只是侥幸过关
And as for the s.E.C.,just remember the last time we barely got off the hook.

300
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,629
我们熬不过另一桩丑闻
We can't take another embarrassment.

301
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,949
你是说公司受不了另一桩丑闻 对吗?
- You mean the firm can't take another embarrassment,right?

302
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,559
低调行事 Adam 拜托啦
- Keep your head down,adam. Please.

303
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:24,729
我要放松的时候就来这里
- I come here a lot when I need to decompress.

304
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:25,799
让我心灵平静
It's peaceful.

305
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,179
你今天在办公室跟人争什么?
- So what were you argui about at the office today?

306
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,469
你的客户不需要担心的事
- That isn't anything that your client needs to worry about.

307
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,719
是证监会吗  这种我的客户显然要担心的事?
- Is the s.E.C. Something my client needs to be worried about?

308
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:41,509
这行有些人总想耍手段玩花样
- In this business,someone's always trying to find the trick,the con.

309
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,229
是啊 那你呢?
- Right. So what's yours?

310
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,179
我们就是懂行而已
- We're just that good.

311
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:52,589
所以你才把你舅舅的钱也投到公司里?
Is that why you invested your uncle's money with the firm?

312
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,219
什么?
- Excuse me?

313
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,509
我们投了一亿五千万
- We have $150 million on the line.

314
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,209
当然什么都想知道 Adam
We'd like to know everything,adam.

315
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:06,229
你姓"Saunders"对吧?
"Saunders" is your given name,right?

316
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,039
但"Sowoski"不是更好吗?
But wouldn't "sowoski" be more accurate?

317
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,239
你找人跟踪我?
- Are you having me followed?

318
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,029
好吧 我们走
All right,let's go.

319
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:18,509
我载你回公司 如果他们还想要你的钱 总会有其他蠢货愿意接手
I'm driving you back to b.Z.,And if they still want your money,some other schmuck can handle it.

320
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:27,939
我们说清楚了 我的家人 我的过去 与你无关 不管你投了多少钱
So we're clear,my family,my past is none of your business,No matter how much money is at stake.

321
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,279
好吧
- Right.

322
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,469
也许我应该报警
- You know,maybe I should call the police.

323
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,899
- 也许你是要报警 - 你说什么?
- You may need to. - What are you talking about?

324
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,579
你看到那边的建筑工地了吗?
- You see the construction equipment back there?

325
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:36,799
嗯 我看见了 怎么了?
- Yeah,I see it. So what?

326
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,839
你看见有工人吗?
- You see any workers with it?

327
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,359
你什么意思 他们让我减速
- What do you mean? They want me to slow down.

328
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,389
我们被逼进绝境了 别停车!
- We're being funneled. Don't stop!

329
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:02,739
有人想除掉Adam Finch
Someone just tried to kill adam,finch.

330
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,543
昨晚之后Saunders先生还好吗?
- How's mr. Saunders after last night?

331
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,213
他以为是一场意外
- He thinks it was an accident.

332
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:18,473
你确定不是?
- And you're sure it wasn't?

333
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:19,883
我们被逼进绝境了
- It's called "funneling."

334
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:23,983
巧妙地诱使目标驶入绝境
You force your target into a kill zone by subtly shifting his direction.

335
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,053
Carter在现场调查
Carter's looking at the scene now.

336
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:28,203
那辆车 还有停车标志
The vehicles,the stop light.

337
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:33,063
职业杀手干的 可谁这么想Adam死 还请了职业杀手?
It was professional,but who wants adam dead enough to bring in a hit team?

338
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:35,313
我在监控我的钱
- I've been watching my money.

339
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:38,373
大部分都投进了一家公司的股票
The majority of it is being shuffled into one company--

340
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,293
Tritak Adam的舅舅也提过
Tritak,same one that adam's uncle mentioned--

341
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,633
只不过是他的十倍
Only at ten times the rate that his money was invested.

342
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,533
有人的动作更迅速了
Someone is moving faster than before.

343
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,683
Tritak投资了路易斯安那州/德州 往东北部的输气管道
- Tritak invests in the louisiana/texas pipeline running gas to the northeast.

344
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:52,763
人们需要天然气
- People need natural gas,

345
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:56,723
大致来说 Tritak的股价应该稳定
So for the most part,tritak should keep a steady price,

346
00:19:56,953 --> 00:20:03,073
但由Baylor Zimm掀起的疯买 使股价最近涨了600% 
But it shot up 600% recently because of a buy frenzy initiated at baylor zimm.

347
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,273
- 内线交易? - 以前发生过
- Insider trading? - Happened before.

348
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:07,623
Adam那时知道情况 也许现在也知道
Adam knew about it then,maybe he knows about it now.

349
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:10,243
不过他这次可没法脱身了
- Except he won't walk away this time.

350
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,273
昨晚差点在路上被杀
We were almost roadkill last night.

351
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,733
我不高兴再兜圈子了
I'm getting tired of playing around.

352
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,793
Sowoski先生 我是证监会的
- Mr. Sowoski,I'm with the s.E.C.

353
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:26,693
我们在调查Bylor Zimm投资 有没有违法行为
We're looking into possible criminal activities at baylor zimm investments.

354
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:29,153
你的侄子是那儿的交易员
We know your nephew is a trader there.

355
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:30,303
什么? 他违法了?
- What? Did he do something wrong?

356
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:32,303
我们也不知道
- We can't be sure.

357
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,593
Adam有没有给你理财建议?
Does adam advise you on your own investments?

358
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,943
没有 我有经纪人的
- No,I got a broker for that.

359
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,733
那你知不知道...
- What can you tell me about...

360
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,783
Tritak能源公司?
a company called tritak energy?

361
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:49,093
不太清楚 这得问我经纪人
- Not much. You'd have to talk to my guy.

362
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:52,583
但你投了很多钱进去 对吗?
- But your own money is heavily invested in it,correct?

363
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,113
对
- Yeah.

364
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:00,973
我知道那件事有点古怪
You know,I knew there was something fishy going on there,

365
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,973
但是Adam 他给我介绍的经纪人好
But adam,he put me with good people.

366
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,223
他说没问题的
He said it was fine.

367
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,633
你对你侄子有多了解?
- How well do you know your nephew?

368
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:14,463
我姐姐死后 Adam的爸爸去西部谋差
- When my sister died,adam's dad left to find work out west.

369
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,633
他最后在新墨西哥州定居 再也没回来
He ended up in new mexico. He never came back.

370
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,443
所以Adam跟我们住一起
So adam lived with my family.

371
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:27,763
每个月 他父亲寄来200块 买漫画书 新鞋子都可以
Every month,his father sent $200 home,for whatever,comic books,new shoes.

372
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,463
Adam从来没用过
Adam never spent it.

373
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:36,103
一年又一年 他把所有的钱存在鞋盒里
Year after year,he saved every penny in shoe boxes.

374
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,843
有好几千块
It was thousands.

375
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:46,053
长大以后 他用这笔钱读夜校 直到考上了真正的商校
And when he grew up,he used it to enroll in night classes before he could get into a real business school.

376
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:52,163
所以 尽管Adam没有父亲...
And in the end,what adam had instead of a father was...

377
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:55,603
他存了一盒钱
cash in a shoe box.

378
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,203
他拿来干嘛了? 他买到了美好的前途
And what did he do? He bought himself a future.

379
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,763
Saunders 我们得谈谈 现在
- Saunders,we should talk,now.

380
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:07,993
关于Tritak
Tritak.

381
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:16,953
一个平庸的公司最近 突然变成市场上最枪手股票
A run-Of-The-Mill m.L.P. Just happens to be the hottest damn equity on the market these days.

382
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,893
你知道些什么情况
You tell me what you know.

383
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:19,993
我什么都不知道
- I don't know anything.

384
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:23,183
我想等你进了劳教所 你就记得了
- Oh,I'll bet you'll start remembering when you're up in otisville.

385
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:25,813
不过到那时候 可没得商量了
But by then,it'll be too late to make a deal.

386
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:28,393
好吧 好吧
- Okay. Okay.

387
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,363
好吧 听着
All right,look. Look.

388
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:33,943
那天晚上 我计算了些数据
I ran some numbers the other night.

389
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:35,833
似乎... 不大对头
It looks like-- It doesn't add up.

390
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:40,743
找不出Baylor Zimm 巨额投资这家公司的原因
There's no reason why Baylor zimm should be dumping so much money into this one company.

391
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:46,213
除非... 除非有人知道 我们不知道的底细
unless--Unless somebody knows something the rest of us don't.

392
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,933
你的数据还在吗?
- You still have the numbers you ran?

393
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:50,983
在我办公室手提电脑里 
- On a laptop,in my office.

394
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,543
去拿
- Get it.

395
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:55,173
马上
Now.

396
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:29,113
借过
- Excuse me.

397
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:49,553
Reese先生 出事了
- Mr. Reese,we have a problem.

398
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,653
他在屋顶
He's on the roof.

399
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:15,883
我们得离开这儿 快
- We got to get you out of here. Come on.

400
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,173
快点
We have to move fast.

401
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,873
这栋楼不安全
This building is tactically unsafe.

402
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,533
你不是资产经理
- You're not an asset manager.

403
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,953
不是 但我能救你的命
- No,but I did save your life.

404
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:28,283
到底发生了什么事?
- What the hell happened back there?

405
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:30,413
有人第二次企图谋杀你
- Just a second attempt to kill you.

406
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:34,573
我要知道Tritak让人不断那么做的原因 
I need to know what about tritak has people repeatedly trying to do that.

407
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,593
是从我舅舅开始的
- I--It started with my uncle.

408
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:37,853
单位把他的钱投资到一个公司
The firm invested him in a company.

409
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,323
他问了我一些情况 所以我去偷偷查了下
He asked me some questions,so I took a peek.

410
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:41,253
这违法的?
- Illegally?

411
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,763
对 但他是家里人 我没想这么多
- Yeah,but he was family. I didn't think anything of it.

412
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,283
但我看到一些数据 有问题
And then I saw some numbers that I didn't agree with,

413
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:50,873
所以我写了个邮件 准备发给 风险管理人 律师 合伙人 所有人
So I wrote an email. I was going to send it to risk management,legal,the partners,everybody,

414
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,763
后来... 证监会开始暗中调查 他们要我不要乱说
But then--Then the s.E.C. Started sneaking around,so I was told to keep my mouth shut.

415
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:56,403
你觉得是内线交易?

这不是第一次了  但我没把邮件发出去

434
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:03,703
上帝 他们杀了她
Oh--Oh,my god. They killed her.

435
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:07,013
Adam 你认得这个酒瓶吗?

只找到受害人和Adam Saunders的指纹

我们认为他和受害人是恋人关系

家里和凶器上都有他的指纹

451
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:05,251
你是说那个香槟酒瓶?

452
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,241
你怎么知道的?
- How'd you know that?

453
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:11,441
-  这里 - 谢了
- Here. - Thanks.

454
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:17,031
有没有可能Saunders和受害人 的确是恋人关系
Is there any chance,if saunders was having a relationship With the vic,

455
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:22,341
所以几天前他摸过香槟酒瓶 然后被人栽赃?
that he could have handled the champagne bottle,Say,days ago,then had it planted?

456
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,521
那就狡猾了
- That'd be pretty slick.

457
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,951
但谁会搞这么麻烦呢?
But who'd go through the trouble?

458
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:28,701
在公寓楼的大垃圾箱里翻个遍?
You'd have to,what,search the building's garbage?

459
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:30,861
地下室是进不去的
Anyway,basement's guarded.

460
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:35,061
除非他们有垃圾车
-  unless they had a garbage truck.

461
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:39,241
Reese先生 咱们在市里 有不少安全地点能安置Adam

463
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:54,131
没人知道我是谁的时候最安全

464
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:55,821

465
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,851

Victor 去找Victor

夜店的朋友?
- Your pal from the nightclub?

477
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:28,891
他是高级经纪人
- He's the senior broker.

478
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,061
如果有人要为Tritak拉客户 不管愿不愿意
If someone's putting clients in tritak,whether or not they want it,

479
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:34,441
接下来能拿到回扣的就是他
He's the next rung down on the brokerage ladder.

480
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:44,091
如果这一议案今天没通过 就会被无限期搁置
if this bill had not been passed today,It would have been put aside indefinitely,

481
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,981
而这对纽约州是不利的
Which we feel would be detrimental to the state of new york.

482
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:50,341
有麻烦了 Reese先生
- We have a problem,mr. Reese.

483
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,041
出什么事了?

呃 是地下岩层

486
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:03,971
那些公司挖开页岩床释放天然气
- Companies dig down and fracture shale beds to release natural gas.

487
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:07,761
刚通过的议案批准了 纽约北部的挖掘工作
They just passed a bill to start fracking in upstate new york,

488
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:12,561
意味着他们不需要 南部来的输气管了
Which means they wouldn't need a pipeline up from the south.

489
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,871
也不用投资Tritak这样的公司了
- And they don't need to invest in a company like tritak.

490
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:18,461
Baylor Zimm向Tritak投了多少钱?

491
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,981
或他的客户投了多少钱?
Or how much did its clients?

492
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:22,971
上百万
- Millions.

493
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:29,871
成千上万 他们会倾家荡产
Millions upon millions,and they will lose everything.

494
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:32,461
Adam预见这一情况 企图阻止
Adam saw this coming,tried to stop it.

495
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:34,621
所以他们要杀他
- Which is why they tried to kill him.

496
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,551
但他们是谁?
- But who are they?

497
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:40,461
Adam叫我去找Victor
- Adam told me to talk to victor.

498
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,491
说他应该知道
Said he would have to know.

499
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:53,251
议案昨晚通过了
- The bill passed overnight.

500
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,831
我尽快卖掉你的股票

501
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,361
你个软柿子
You're a patsy.

502
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,431
他们利用了你
They just used you,

503
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:13,171
但你的老板死了 Adam命悬一线 成千上万人倾家荡产
But your boss is dead,adam's life is on the line,and millions were lost.

504
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:16,571
人们需要那个钱 他们有家庭
People needed that money. Families.

505
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,381
我以为压Tritak是安全的
- I thought tritak was a safe bet.

506
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:27,591
有人买通参议员 有很有权的人 足以推动页岩开采议案通过
Someone got to the senators,someone powerful enough to push that shale fracking bill through the system.

507
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:30,141
为什么抬高Tritak的股价?
- But why build tritak up?

508
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,871
为什么要做掉Adam...
Why silence adam...

509
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,871
就是为了看它破产吗?
only to watch it fail?

510
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:51,751
<i>Tritak能源暴跌</i>
Tritak ***out

511
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,501
这是清仓
Listen,it's a short sale.

512
00:30:56,701 --> 00:31:00,011
有人操纵交易员抬高价格高价卖出
Someone had the brokers pump up the price and then sold high,

513
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,401
因为他们知道法案会通过 会毁了Tritak
Because they knew that the bill was gonna pass and kill tritak.

514
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:06,101
这时做空的人能赚几百万
Whoever shorted it stands to make millions on this.

515
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,321
所以他们才盯上你
- That's why they targeted you.

516
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:10,301
那我们怎么把做空的人找出来?
So how do we find the short-Seller?

517
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,511
看看你周围 几十个交易员都在卖Tritak
- Look around you--There's 50 brokers selling off tritak.

518
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,051
我们要找几天前就卖了的那些人
We need to find the guys who already sold it days ago,

519
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,601
因为现在他们为了掩饰要买回来
Because now they have to cover the short and buy it back.

520
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:20,231
我得挂了
I got to go.

521
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:25,211
嗨 Bob舅舅
Hey,uncle bob.

522
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:28,801
Adam 怎么了? 你告诉我Tritak很可靠
- Adam,what's going on? You told me tritak was safe.

523
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:31,921
Bob 对不起 非常抱歉 我会把你的钱拿回来
- Bob,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll get your money back.

524

525
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:35,901
那是大家的工资和养老金
It--It's salaries. It's pensions.

526
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,981
我手下所有人的钱都在那儿
It's every employee that works for me.

527
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:40,611
那是我的生意 写着Sowoski这个名字
It's my business,the sowoski name.

528
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:41,431
Bob 我
- Bob,i-I-- Look--

529
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:44,971
你不姓Sowoski 至少你自己不这么想
- But you're not a sowoski,at least you never thought you were.

530
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:47,671
你姓Saunders
You're a saunders.

531
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:49,661
不是么 Adam?
Isn't that right,adam?

532
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:51,991
不是的 听着 我会把钱拿回来--
- No,listen-- Listen,I'll get it back.

533
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,821
哪怕花上我下半辈子我也要拿回来
Even if it takes the rest of my life,i will get it back.

534
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,931
我得挂了
I got to go.

535
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,631
嗨 老大?
- Hey,boss?

536
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:04,171
我想我找到那小子了
I think I got a location on the kid.

537
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:07,771
我要你帮忙 Finch.
- I'm going to need your help on this,finch.

538
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:10,871
我要你混进Baylor Zimm
I need you to get inside baylor zimm.
