00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,803
你正被监视着 政府有一套秘密的系统
<i>You are being watched.</i> <i>The government has a secret system...</i>

2
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:10,705
一个无时无刻都在监视你的机器
<i>A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.</i>

3
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:13,731
我知道 是因为这机器是我造的
<i>I know, because I built it.</i>

4
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:17,932
我设计这机器是用来查找恐怖活动的 但它却什么都能看到...
<i>I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,</i> <i>but it sees everything...</i>

5
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:22,104
包含普通人的暴力犯罪 像你一样的普通人
<i>Violent crimes involving ordinary people,</i> <i>people like you,</i>

6
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:24,920
这种犯罪 政府认为不相干
<i>crimes the government considered irrelevant.</i>

7
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:28,546
他们不肯作为 所以我决定自己插手
<i>They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.</i>

8
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:33,772
但我需要一个搭档  一个有能力进行干预的搭档
<i>But I needed a partner,</i> <i>someone with the skills to intervene.</i>

9
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:37,929
由于被当局追捕 我们只能秘密行动
<i>Hunted by the authorities,</i> <i>we work in secret.</i>

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,905
你永远不会找到我们 但无论是受害者还是行凶者
<i>You will never find us.</i> <i>But victim or perpetrator,</i>

11
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:44,914
只要你的号码蹦出来 我们就会找到你

<i>No attachments of any kind.</i> <i>A bit like you, Mr. Reese.</i>

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,965
在肯尼迪机场时发现这个人的护照有点问题 移民局的人正赶过来 我们应该等一会

"This guy" just flew 15 hours for a heart transplant.

19
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:26,583
我不会让他在离医院16个街区的地方等死的
I'm not letting him code out here 16 blocks from the hospital.

20
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,507
不管从哪方面看
<i>For all intents and purposes,</i>

21
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,346
Cahill表面上都像是一个守法的好公民 
<i>Cahill appears to be an upstanding citizen.</i>

22
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:36,464
表象大多是假的
<i>Appearances can be deceptive.</i>

23
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:40,612
我们给了你不少钱 所以给我安静点 好吗?
We're paying you good money, so keep your mouth shut, okay?

24
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,159
没错 Cahill是个罪犯
<i>Indeed. Cahill's a criminal.</i>

25
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,398
入室抢劫 用致命武器攻击警察

26

27
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:55,227
走私团伙的老大叫Vargas
<i>Crew's run by a guy named Vargas.</i>

28
00:01:55,952 --> 00:02:00,747
这些人什么都走私 谁找他们的麻烦 他们就杀死谁
<i>These guys will move anything.</i> <i>And if someone gets in their way, they'll kill everyone.</i>

29
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:02,708
你觉得我们应该从何入手 Reese先生?
<i>How do you suggest we proceed, Mr. Reese?</i>

30
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,080
和往常一样 Finch 他们越危险...
<i>As usual, Finch. The more dangerous they are...</i>

31
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,530
你还在等什么? 开车
What are you waiting for? Go.

32
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:08,754
我越想靠近他们

放松 孩子
Relax, kid.

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,909
Cahill能把警察打发走
Cahill will talk us out of this.

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,801
如果他不能 他就会杀死他
And if he can't, he'll just kill him.

41
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:48,000
我从没见过比他更恨警察的人
I never met a guy who hated cops as much as this guy.

42
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,902
是啊 他怎么去了这么长时间?
Yeah, so what's taking him so long, huh?

43
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:53,320
他要是叫后援的话 我们就死定了
He calls backup and we're all dead.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,996
他没有后援 HR那我都打点好了
He doesn't have backup. I'm all paid up with HR.

45
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,928
你都搞定了?
You found this rig?

46
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,988
尾灯坏了 我们的朋友不过是出于好心 告诉了我们一声
Tail light's out. Our friend was just letting us know as a courtesy.

47
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,539

48

00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:47,189
- 你知道他要去哪吗? - 不知道
- <i>Any idea where he's going?</i> - <i>No.</i>

54
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,916
但不管他要干什么 肯定不是什么好事
<i>But whatever he's up to, can't be good.</i>

55
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,538
Finch Cahill正在一户人家附近踩点

屋主姓Tulley

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,382
他是个警察 John 你得拦住Cahill

- 爹地! 爹地! 你回来了 - 嘿 孩子

64
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:55,468
Reese先生 看来你不是唯一一个卧底的人
<i>Mr. Reese, it appears</i> that you're not the only person working undercover.

65
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:27,594
- 他们可能会更新我们的指令 - 你觉得他们会通过CIA吗?
They might be updating our orders. You think this is being run through Langley?

66
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:30,730
我们甚至不应该在这个国家里执行任务
We're not even supposed to operate in this godforsaken country.

67
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:32,773
你要把那玩意擦多少遍才肯罢休?
How many times are you gonna clean that thing?

68
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:36,643
在陆军里 他们教我们挨枪子的最快方法
In the army, they taught us the fastest way to get shot

69
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,490

76
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,517
不是万事俱备吧 你这少个杯子
Almost everything. You're missing a glass.

77
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,238
找到了
Found it.

78
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,727
那个包裹 他会有什么下场?
The package. What'd he do?

79
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:25,819
- 那就不关我们的事了 - 那人看起来像是政府部门的
- Not our concern. - Guy looks government.

80

本地人不喜欢我们抓他们的人
The natives don't like us taking their people.

81
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,434
他是政府的人

82
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,671
打算把我们的东西卖给中国人
Tried to sell something of ours to the Chinese.

83
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,735
- 什么东西? - 软件
- What? - Software.

84
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:39,853
还是别的什么 我不知道 也不在乎
Something. I don't know, don't care.

85
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,161
我们的任务就是...
We've got one job in this...

86
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:44,256
把他送到一个他永远都回不来的荒芜之地
Render him to some black hole from which he will never return.

87
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:49,269
如果文件有问题或是飞机没燃料了 你就结果了他
If the papers don't clear or the plane runs out of fuel, you execute him.

88
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:54,204

Call's not coming in tonight. Go get yourself some R&R.

90
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:05,863
别忘了你是在敌后

91
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,903
你要是在这被抓了 没人会去救你
You get caught here, you're on your own.

92
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,514
Cahill彻底把我给耍了
Cahill certainly had me fooled.

93
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:45,489
Cahill的真名叫做Daniel Tulley 2003年从警校毕业
<i>Cahill's real name is Daniel Tulley.</i> Graduated from the police academy in 2003.

94
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,515
从那时起 所有的工作记录都消失了
Since then, all work records have disappeared.

95
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:51,763
纽约警局似乎费了很大的力气来掩盖他的身份
<i>The NYPD seems to have gone to great lengths</i> <i>to hide his identity,</i>

96
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,470
包括给了他一个假的社保号码
<i>including a false social security number.</i>

97
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,850
但如果机器给出了他的号码的话 那意味着有人发现他是警察
But if the machine gave us his number, it may mean that somebody's figured out he's a cop.

98
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,051
- 我们应该给他提个醒 - 他的工作本身就是有生命危险的
We should warn him. Risking his life is what he signed up for.

99
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:06,587
我们要是出了什么差错...  可能导致的弊会大于利
We play this wrong... We could do more harm than good.

100
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,976
有人过来了 Finch
We've got company, Finch.

101
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:29,820
你要是想暴露身份的话 还不如直接拿着这个呢?
Why don't you just wear it if you're gonna go announcing yourself?

102
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:34,768
你职业生涯的最大成功就近在咫尺了 你却决定回来度个小假?
Less than a day away from the biggest collar of your career, you decide to take a holiday?

103
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:37,854
- 这个人是Cahill的联系人 - 没人跟踪我 我只是...
The man's Cahill's handler. <i>No one followed me. I just...</i>

104
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,358
需要感受一下正常的生活
Needed to feel normal.

105
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,564
我们手里关于Vargas的罪证够多的了 你现在可以归队了
We got enough on Vargas. I could pull you out now.

106
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,618
我们五个月前就能拿下Vargas 他只是个走私犯
We could have gotten Vargas five months ago. He's just a smuggler.

107
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,743
L.O.S.才是我们想抓的那个人
L.O.S., that's the guy we want.

108
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,859
传说他下次会亲自去提货
Word is he's picking up the next shipment in person.

109
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,259
L.O.S.只是个传说 Michael
L.O.S. is a fairy tale, Michael.

110
00:09:57,341 --> 00:10:02,155
这就是上次送货时L.O.S.给我的 纯度是100%的
I took this from the last delivery from L.O.S. It's 100% pure.

111
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,297
我们找到大鱼了 直接的源头
We found the big one. The direct source.

112
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,888
不管这个L.O.S.是谁...
Whoever this L.O.S. is...

113
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,522
如果没人敢动他的货 那肯定是有原因的
If no one's stepping on his shipments, there's a good reason.

114
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:16,987
我不想最后穿着一身黑 不得不通知你妻子...
I don't want to wind up in a dark suit, having to inform your wife...

115
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:19,860
我负责我的部分 你负责你的
I'll take care of my end, you take care of yours.

116
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,249
我认为Vargas警局里有眼线
I think Vargas has a cop in his pocket.

117
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,728
昨天晚上他对于那个警察没有后援太自信了
Last night he was too confident that black and white wouldn't have backup.

118
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,820
他警局里有人在保护他 我很确定
He's got someone protecting him from the inside, I'm sure of it.

119
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:35,695
我会调查看看的
I'll look into it.

120
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:41,960
Cahill认为Vargas警局里有人 
Cahill believes Vargas has a cop on his payroll.

121
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:43,609
我也这么认为
<i>So do I.</i>

122
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,454
Vargas说HR那都打点好了...
<i>Vargas was talking about being paid up with HR...</i>

123
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:50,440
跟想让Elias杀死Carter的是同一拨受贿警察
<i>The same corrupt cops who were willing to let Elias kill Carter.</i>

124
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,072
Carter警探!
Detective Carter!

125
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,630
Snow探员
Agent Snow.

126
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,809
我不知道你还在市里呢
Didn't realize you were still in town.

127
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,636
我去了趟北部
I took a trip upstate.

128
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,019
- 我现在肯定那人肯定在和某个警官合作 - 你怎么会这么说呢?
I'm sure now that our boy's working with a police officer. What makes you say that?

129
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,929
在Catskills的一个兽医诊所发现了他的指纹
Found his fingerprints at a veterinary clinic in the Catskills.

130
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,088
然后我确定John从没去过那里
And yet I am certain that John was never there.

131
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:24,367
我希望他的新朋友能幸运一点
I hope his new friend is luckier.

132
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:29,155
John习惯利用别人 然后抛弃他们 
John has a tendency to use people and then, well, discard them.

133
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,003
我还记得他以前搭档的葬礼 仿佛就在昨天
I remember his old partner's funeral like it was yesterday.

134
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,336
一个漂亮的女人 像你一样
A pretty woman. Like you.

135
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:39,659
在他利用完她之后 弃之如敝屣
After he was done with her, not so much.

136
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,649
说句话 警探
A word, Detective.

137
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:57,473
你知道枪击了John的人刚还在这吧?
You do realize the man that shot John was just here?

138
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,811
Snow探员不知道我的存在...
Agent Snow doesn't know about me...

139
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:02,445
也不知道我与我们共同朋友的关系
Or my arrangement with our mutual friend.

140
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:05,022
我们需要你的帮助 警探
We need your help, Detective.

141
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:08,554
这个人叫Michael Cahill 还被称为Daniel Tulley...
This man is Michael Cahill, otherwise known as Daniel Tulley...

142
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:11,505
在一个走私团伙卧底的缉毒警察
Narcotics Detective working undercover with a smuggling ring.

143
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:13,627
Reese先生刚刚打入他们的内部
One that Mr. Reese has just infiltrated.

144
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:15,038
他当然会这么做
Of course he has.

145
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,421
但我们认为纽约警局内有内鬼
But we believe that there's a leak at the NYPD.

146
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:21,897
不用我说 你就知道Cahill的身份 要是暴露的话 会发生什么
I don't need to tell you what can happen if Cahill's cover is blown.

147
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:26,170
- 而你希望我找到这个内鬼 - 我只是需要你来解释一下事情是如何运作的
And you expect me to find this leak. I just need you to explain the system.

148
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:30,665
- 有谁知道Cahill卧底的事情? - 只有他的联络人
Who would know about Cahill's being undercover? Only his handler.

149
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:35,857
那有权浏览他的报告和档案的人呢?
What about the people that have access to his paperwork, files?

150
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:41,564
卧底的档案只有纸质材料  所以像你这种人是无法黑进去的
Files on undercovers are kept only as hard copies, so people like you can't hack into them.

151
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:43,835
你这话太伤人了 警探
Words wound, Detective.

152
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:45,144
文件存在保险箱里
<i>The files are kept in safes</i>

153
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:48,134
保险箱放在由内务部看管的屋子里
<i>in one room controlled by IAB.</i>

154
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:54,609
但是 只有联络人才有卧底资料保险箱的密码
<i>However, only the handlers</i> <i>have the combinations to their UC's safe.</i>

155
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,524
想闯进去的人
<i>Anyone tries to break in,</i>

156
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,453
内务部都会把他们送去监狱 永远别想出来
<i>IAB will send them on a one-way trip to Rikers.</i>

157
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:02,895
我们得在别人到手前 毁掉Cahill的文件
We would need to destroy Cahill's file before anyone could retrieve it.

158
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:07,176
我们? 闯入警察总部可是联邦重罪
We? Yeah, see, breaking into 1PP is a federal offense.

159
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:08,831
我会搞定这点的
I've got it covered.

160
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,055
让我猜猜 你又要找我帮忙了吧
Let me guess, you need another favor.

161
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:22,690
有人可能要把一个卧底缉毒警察的身份
Someone might be selling out an undercover narc

162
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,158
卖给一个叫Vargas的走私犯

163
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:28,190
去找找你缉毒队的狐朋狗友们
Pay some of your dirty buddies in narcotics a visit.

164
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,514
那些人不相信我了
Those guys don't exactly trust me anymore.

165
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:34,098
我最近干了不少好事 还得到了一次嘉奖
I've been getting some good collars lately too. Even got a commendation.

166
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,500
你的屁股让你得到的那次嘉奖
Your ass got you that commendation.

167
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,695
是时候再当回坏人了
Time to get your hands dirty again.

168
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:59,336
嗯? 你不用说
Yeah? You don't say.

169
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,509
哪一个?
Which one?

170
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,958
那就找出来 现在
Well, find out then. Now.

171
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,275
出事了 Finch Vargas接到了一通电话 他脸色不太好
Something's wrong, Finch. Vargas got a phone call, and he's not happy about it.

172
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:13,403
我们现在要去送货
We go ahead with the delivery now.

173
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:24,175
因为我们要是不去 L.O.S.会杀死我们的
Because L.O.S. will kill us if we don't.

174
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:40,202
我有几次是请你过来吃晚餐的?
How many time I invite you for dinner?

175
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:45,698
- 你过来都是为了生意 - 生意才是王道 没时间吃饭
All business with you. Business is good. No time to eat.

176
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,577
你知道 我一直在想
You know, I've been thinking.

177
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,583
你我可能想重新商量一下我们的交易
You and I might want to renegotiate our deal.

178
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:04,881
你知道 做我们这行的 思考...
You know, in our business, thinking...

179
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,600
是最危险的事情
Is the most dangerous thing you can start doing.

180
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:16,275
或者我可以直接把货送到L.O.S.手里?
Or maybe I take the shipment directly to L.O.S.?

181
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,132
把你撇掉
Cut you out.

182
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:31,333
好吧 好吧 我跟你说
Fine, fine. Tell you what.

183
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,508
我多给你点怎么样 行吗?
How about I give you a little something extra, okay?

184
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,517
只给你? 如何?
Just for you? Yeah?

想抓住他来着 看我能否分掉他一杯羹
Want to twist his arm a little bit, see if I can get a percentage of his scores.

260
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:01,347

You'll get used to it. It takes a little time, - which you're running out of. - <i>Okay, okay.</i>

274
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:57,005
- 什么方案 老牛仔?  - 这方案很简单
- What's the plan, Kimosabe? - <i>The plan is simple.</i>

275
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:59,186
监管房间的内务部警探
The IAB Detective that patrols the room

276
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:02,818
会在换班前做最后一次检查
makes one more inspection before the next shift begins.

277
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,186
所以你有约8分半钟的时间
That will give you approximately 8 1/2 minutes

278
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:08,749
蒙取钥匙卡 打开保险箱 在Vargas的内线到达前
to spoof the key card, break into the safe, <i>and retrieve Tulley's file</i>

279
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,908
找到Tulley的档案
<i>before Vargas's informant can get to it.</i>

280
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,121
知道了 是挺简单的
Yeah, sure. Sounds simple.

281
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:14,893
一定要把读卡器对准钥匙卡
Make sure you point the reader at the key card.

282
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:18,890
- 还有啥要嘱咐的? - 别被逮住
Anything else I should know? Yeah, don't get caught.

283
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,761
谢了 我会尽最大努力
Thanks a lot. I'll try my best.

284
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:24,601
Fusco 你来这干嘛?
Fusco, what are you doing here?

285
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:26,899
- 你干嘛呢? - 我要走了
- What are you doing? - Uh, I was just leaving.

286
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,879
我来帮队长办点事
I'm just, uh, running an errand for the Captain.

287
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,875
- 回见  - 好的 祝你今天愉快
- Later. - Yeah, you have a good day.

288
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:31,935
好的
All right.

289
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:44,299
- Carter警探 - 找到三个关于那个车牌的记录
Detective Carter. <i>Got three possible hits on that license plate.</i>

290
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,661
是南布鲁克林一辆警车的 自动分析仪上记录的
<i>It was logged by an automatic plate reader</i> <i>on a Cruiser in South Brooklyn.</i>

291
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:49,046
我这就去查
I'm gonna start looking.

292
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:51,031
太好了 谢谢 警探
I'm glad to hear it. Thank you, Detective.

293
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,062
- Finch Finch? 在听吗? - 我在呢 说吧
- <i>Finch, Finch? You there?</i> - I'm here. Go ahead.

294
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:54,555
好了 我要进去了
All right. I'm going in now.

295
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,168
- 不好意思 - 没事
I'm... I'm sorry. That's fine.

296
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:09,430
小菜一碟 我进来了
Presto. I'm in.

297
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,476
- 好了 现在干嘛? - 关掉荧光灯
Okay, what now? Turn off the fluorescents.

298
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,215
用我给你的手电
<i>Use that light I gave you.</i>

299
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:29,012
- 看到指纹了吗? - 3-5-8
<i>Do you see the prints?</i> 3-5-8.

300
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:32,236
开始按吧 密码可能是任意组合
Start punching numbers. <i>The code could be in any sequence.</i>

301
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:37,652
- 我们快没时间了 警探 - 各种组合都试了 没用
We're running out of time, Detective. I tried every combination. It's not working.

302
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,483
帮个忙啊
A little help, please?

303
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,237
- 有没有哪个指纹比较模糊? - 5号有点模糊 咋了?
Was one of the prints smudged? Yeah, 5 is a little blurry, why?

304
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:45,101
它被按了两次 试下3-5-5-8
It's used twice. Try 3-5-5-8.

305
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,879
5-5-8-3
5-5-8-3.

306
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,938
8-5-3-5
8-5-3-5.

307
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:52,936
还真打开了
Can't believe it worked.

308
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,676
- 我拿到Tulley的档案了 - 很好 警探
- I've got Tulley's file. - <i>Good job, Detective</i>.

309
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,215
Tulley现在安全了
<i>Tulley's safe for now.</i>

310
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:02,002
你还有23秒时间离开
You have 23 seconds left.

311
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:09,840
Fusco警探 对吧?
Detective Fusco, right?

312
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,283
我们对你和你的伙计们进行了调查
My department investigated you and your buddies.

313
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:17,906
- 听着 事情不是你想的那样 我可以解释 - 解释为什么销毁机密文件?
Listen, this isn't what it looks like. I can explain. Explain shredding a confidential file?

314
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,573
你被逮捕了
You're under arrest.

315
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:37,934
我不得不销毁那文件
I had to destroy that file.

316
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,957
- 有位卧底警察有生命危险 - 你怎么知道的?
There was a UC whose life was in danger. And you know this how?

317
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,964
有人跟我说的
I've got a guy... tells me things.

318
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:48,048
- 什么人? 说啥了? - 小心说话 警探
What guy? What things? <i>Careful what you say, Detective.</i>

319
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:52,530
我们能看顾你 但这些人在找我们的朋友
<i>We can look after you, but these men</i> are looking for our friend.

320
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:56,828
这人是谁并不重要
Look, it doesn't make a difference who the guy is.

321
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:00,458
你只需知道 有位警察命悬一线 我在救他
All you need to know is that a cop's life was on the line and I was trying to save him.

322
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:08,007
喂 我遇到麻烦了 没法拿到文件了
Yeah. I got a problem. I couldn't get the file.

323
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:10,002
有个白痴把文件毁了
Some idiot destroyed it.

324
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:14,166
不管谁是内鬼 你那边有人给他打电话
But whoever the rat is, I got word he just made <i>a phone call from your location.</i>

325
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,310
什么意思 有人打过电话? 不可能
What do you mean, somebody made a call? That's impossible.

326
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:17,837
我得处理点事
I've got to take care of a situation.

327
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:20,958
- 晚点再打给你 - 你是那个内线
- I'll call you back later. - You're the informant.

328
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:44,056
他的手机呢?
Where's his phone?

329
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,106
等我把你毙了就不难找了
Whole let easier for me to search you after I shoot you.

330
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:51,942
他拿了
He took it.

331
00:26:52,748 --> 00:26:55,213
说什么呢 我啥时拿了
You kidding? Huh? The hell I did.

332
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:00,215
放开我!
Get off me!

333
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:07,167
应该不难找到
Shouldn't be too hard to find out.

334
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,827
看来找到我们的内鬼了
Looks like we found our rat.

335
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:56,055
是你跟警察告发了L.O.S.? 那次送货?
You tell the cops about L.O.S.? Huh? The delivery?

336
00:27:56,056 --> 00:28:00,588
别浪费时间了 我的援兵很快就到了
You shouldn't waste time. My reinforcements will be here any minute.

337
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:05,763
如果真那样 我的人会告知我的 你也早死了
If that were true, I would have gotten a call from my guy and you'd be dead.

338
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,361
我们这样是行不通的
We're not getting anywhere.

339
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,375
给我点时间 我来让他开口
Give me time alone. I'll get him to talk.

340
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:13,625
你最好让他开口 否则你俩就等死吧
You better get him to talk or you both catch a bullet.

341
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:22,662
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

342
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:26,024
- 我知道你不是警察 - 没错
- I know you're not a cop. - No.

343
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:28,590
但我以前是卧底
But I've been undercover.

344
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:33,192
我知道你最大的梦想 是回家和你妻子Melinda团聚
I know the only thing you want in the world is to go home to your wife Melinda,

345
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:35,011
还有你儿子Danny
to your son Danny.

346
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:41,553
直说了吧 你不了解我
Let's get one thing straight. You don't know me.

347
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,057
我知道你的联络人叫Byrne
I know your handler's name is Byrne.

348
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:48,529
我知道你从2003年就开始干这个
I know you've been on the force since 2003.

349
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:53,264
我知道你还有个叫Connor的弟弟 在你高中毕业一个月后吸毒过量
I know you had a younger brother Connor who O.D.'d a month after you graduated high school.

350
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,313
你怎么...
How did you...

351
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:57,261
所以你才这么想抓到L.O.S.
That's why you're so committed to catching L.O.S.

352
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:04,881
你是FBi还是?
What, are you a fed or something?

353
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,723
差不多吧
Something.

354
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,895
我能帮你逃走 帮你回家
I can help you escape. Help you get home.

355
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:14,496
如果你真那么了解我 就该知道我不会回家的
If you know me so well, then you know I won't go home.

356
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:18,361
- 只要L.O.S.还没被铲除 - 你的身份快要暴露了
Not while L.O.S. Is still operating. Your cover's gonna be blown.

357
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:20,565
你留下来 会冒很大风险
You stay, you risk everything.

358
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:25,091
你的生活 你的家人
Your life... Your family.

359
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,856
你能给我妻子捎个话吗?
Can you get a message to my wife?

360
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:35,078
告诉她我爱她
Tell her I love her.

361
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:39,402
我们会想办法让你回家的
We'll find a way to get you home.

362
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:42,947
你可以自己告诉她
And you can tell her yourself.

363
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,733
- 他们在废品厂交易 - 他来了
The exchange is at the scrapyard. He's coming.

364
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:53,062
好吧
That's right.

365
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,253
- 他说什么了吗? - 我还需要点时间
He say anything yet? I need more time.

366
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,826
好吧 没时间了
Okay, there's no more time.

367
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:02,663
- Ajax死了 我们得处理掉尸体 - 不 交给我吧
Ajax is dead. We've gotta dump the bodies. No, no. Let me do it.

368
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:05,872
我要亲眼看看这内鬼死去时的表情
I want to see the look on his face as I end this rat.

369
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,191
那你来吧
Help yourself.

370
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:25,215
有什么计划 John? 要杀掉这人吗?
What's the play here, John? We're gonna kill this guy?

371
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,797
把他的尸体放进酸液缸里溶掉?
Dissolve his body in a bathtub full of acid?

372
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:31,166
还是只是吓吓他?
Or are you just scratching an itch?

373
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:34,887
他叫Peter
His name is Peter.

374
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:39,899
37岁 年薪17.5万
He's 37, makes 175,000 a year.

375
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:44,026
他到底是个好男人 还是杀人恶魔 我也不知道
Is he a good guy or a serial killer? I don't know.

376
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,464
但不管怎样 他比你更能爱护她
But either way, he'll take better care of her than you could.

377
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,821
所以我犹豫是否带你回来
This is why I worried about bringing you back.

378
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:56,914
你和这里其他人看着是一样
See, you look like the rest of these people...

379
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:01,126
但你以后就不一样了 不是吗?
But you're not like them anymore, are you?

380
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:03,921
如果他们知道你的工作...
If they knew what you'd done...

381
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:09,345
- 他们跟你不是一个世界的 - 我们在黑暗中前行
You're barely even the same species. We're walking in the dark.

382
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,055
我听过这场演讲
I've heard this speech before.

383
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:17,758
抱歉 我不知道你佳人有约呢
Sorry, I didn't realize you were meeting someone as well.

384
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,740
亲爱的 你没跟他介绍你老婆吗?
Honey, you didn't tell him about your much-better half?

385
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:24,176
等下可有得受了
There will be hell to pay later.

386
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,608
- 我们该走了  - 等等
- We should get going. - Wait.

387
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:28,906
再等等 我很想介绍我妻子给你们认识
Two seconds. Um, I really want you to meet my wife.

388
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:32,112
她肯定很高兴能认识Puyallup来的人
She's going to get a kick out of meeting someone from Puyallup.

389
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:40,077
我懂的 真的
I get it. Believe me.

390
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:45,204
我第一次回来时 直接回了家
First time I rotated back, I went straight home to my family.

391
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,478
我在门外的出租车里呆看了3个小时
I sat outside in the rental car for three hours, just watching.

392
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:52,637
我想我可以告诉他们我所有的见闻
And I realized I could tell them everything that I'd seen,

393
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:57,339
所有做过的事 但他们根本不会懂
everything that I'd done, and they wouldn't understand a single word.

394
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:01,819
这不是什么演讲
This isn't some speech.

395
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:06,337
我们没有...在黑暗中前行
We're not... walking in the dark.

396
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,389
我们就是黑暗
We are the dark.

397
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:13,540
- 噢 Peter - Jessica
- Oh, Peter. - Jessica.

398
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:17,530
- 抱歉 我来晚了 - 该撤了 John
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. It's time to go, John.

399
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:25,066
- 我想给你介绍这里的一对夫妇 - 好啊
There's a couple at the bar I want you to meet. Okay.

400
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:32,435
貌似只有我们了?
- Huh. - I guess it's just us?

401
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:33,856
- 是啊 - 嗯
- Yeah. - Yeah.

402
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,936
干嘛呢你?
What's the holdup?

403
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:03,340
没了这个他就不好辨认了
He'll be harder to I.D. without this.

404
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:06,564
整辆车都会被烧毁 不会留下任何痕迹
Car will burn hot enough. Won't be anything left to I.D.

405
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,877
要搭车吗? 我就在隔壁
Need a lift? I was in the neighborhood.

406
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:34,947
真是我的幸运之日
My lucky day.

407
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:37,387
你说的幸运之日
Your version of a lucky day

408
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:39,204
就是中枪后 被扔进火海?
is being shot and lit on fire?

409
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:41,799
没击中 擦了下皮而已
Not shot, just grazed.

410
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,417

It's for you.

412
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:55,980
- Cahill去哪了? - 那啥 我...

Cahill went to the exchange with L.O.S. Without backup.

- 除了你腰上那把 还有别的枪吗? - 有

姑娘你很懂我心嘛
Girl after my own heart.

419
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,944
- Reese先生 - 干嘛

Fusco警探在Vargas的内线手上
Vargas's informant has Detective Fusco.

422
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:26,055
他处境肯定也很危险

423
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:30,460
Reese先生 我们没时间两个都救了
<i>Mr. Reese,</i> I'm not sure we have time to save them both.

424
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,507

425
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,991
这位就是L.O.S.?
This is L.O.S.?

426
00:35:54,544 --> 00:35:56,371
你可真能折腾
You made a mess out of this.

427
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:09,239
下次别让我等这么久
Next time, don't keep me waiting.

428
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:16,809
退后! 退后!
Back! Back!

429
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,710
你们都退后 不然我崩了你们老大的脑袋
You stay back, or I spill your boss's brains on the asphalt.

430
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:22,901
知道你是在恐吓谁吗?
Do you know who you're threatening?

431
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,521
你的救兵呢 小子?
Where's your backup, son?

432
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:30,274
放他走
Let him go.

433
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:32,532
那你得开枪才行
You're going to have to shoot.

434
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,098
换我就不会这样做
I wouldn't do that.

435
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,682
趴好 谁都不准动
Stay down. Don't nobody move.

436
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:59,164
- 跪下 - 你要逮捕我吗?
On the ground. You gonna arrest me?

437
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,624
我14小时后就会被释放
I'll be out in 14 hours.

438
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,122
然后就会去找你
Then I'm coming for you.

439
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:10,240
恐吓警察 我指控时会给你加上这条
Threatening a police officer. I'll add that to the charges.

440
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:14,868
不会有指控的 至少跟那个沾不上边
There won't be any charges. At least none that stick.

441
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:18,823
- 他是中情局的 - 什么?
He's CIA. What?

442
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,633
- 中情局的人也贩毒? - 政府不能彻底铲除毒品犯罪
The CIA's trafficking drugs? The government couldn't win the war on drugs...

443
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:26,166
就利用它来给反恐战争提供资金
So they're using it to fund the war on terror.

444
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,728
- 有那么众所周知么? - 可能吧
This is common knowledge? Doubtful.

445
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,201
中情局就是靠秘密建起来的
The company's built on secrets.

446
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:36,848
我把我的命都押在这上面
I risked my life for this.

447
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:43,018
- 我要逮捕他 - 你要这样做了他们会毁了你的职业生涯的
- I'm taking him in. - You do and the company will ruin your career.

448
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,744
这还是往好了说
And that's if you're lucky.

449
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:51,742
- 我还是要逮捕他 - 你也老是喜欢博运气
I'm taking him in. Always liked to push my luck too.

450
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:04,847
知道我为啥干得这么好吗 Fusco?
Do you know why I'm so good at my job, Fusco?

451
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:10,138
- 我能看得出坏警察 - 你应该照照镜子
I can tell a dirty cop when I see one. You should try looking in the mirror.

452
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:12,883
你可能觉得自己变好了
You know, you may think you've gone clean,

453
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:16,001
找到了上帝 佛 或者非洲萨满
found God, Buddha, or some African shaman,

454
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:21,370
但到了最后 你的双手仍然肮脏 永远都是
but at the end of the day, your hands are still dirty. Always will be.

455
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:23,459
听见了吗?
You hear that?

456
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,896
- 我什么都没听见 - 这就对了
I don't hear nothing. That's right.

457
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:31,829
没有警笛声 没有扩音器
No sirens, no bullhorns.

458
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,252
没人来救你 没人关心你
No one's coming to save you. No one cares.

459
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:40,629
那个...跟你告密的人...
That guy... The one who tells you things...

460
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:45,520
他利用了你 然后就把你扔下不管
He used you, then let you rot like a piece of garbage.

461
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:48,653
如果你告诉我是谁
Might as well tell me who it is.

462
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,781
起码你还有机会找他算账
At least you'll have the satisfaction of repaying the favor.

463
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:54,427
你以为你是第一个拿枪指我的人吗?
You think you're the first person to put a gun to my head?

464
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,944
不 但我将是最后一个
No. But I will be the last.

465
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,165
是啊 可能吧
Yeah, maybe you will.

466
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,940
你中过枪吗?
You ever been shot?

467
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,892
脑中想着各种疯狂的事
Craziest things go through your mind...

468
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:13,550
好在我是换了干净内衣 那些龌龊的就不说了
Glad I put on clean underwear, hid that stash of porn.

469
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:17,965
遗憾你儿子将来会发现他老子是个坏警察
Sorry that your son had to find out that his old man was a dirty cop.

470
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,284
然后你会意识到自己活不长了
Then you realize you're gonna die.

471
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,528
就想努力去做点好事
You try to go down doing something good.

472
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:34,685
- 这事你也说不准 对吧 - 跪下
You wouldn't know about that, would you, - you dirty sack? - Kneel.

473
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,256
- 你这时间掐得也太紧了吧? - 起码我没来晚
Cutting it kind of close, don't you think? At least I'm not late.

474
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:03,896
我得上报这事 我能把这宗枪击摆平
I gotta call this in. I can make this a good shooting.

475
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:07,067
这电话是他跟Vargas联系的唯一证据吗?
That phone is the only proof that this guy was working with Vargas?

476
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:08,657
- 是的 - 给我看看
- Yeah. - Let me see it.

477
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,930
- 你这是干嘛? - 你不能坦白 Lionel
- What the hell are you doing? - I can't have you coming clean, Lionel.

478
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,998
你要打入HR 接近他们
I need you inside HR. Get close to them.

479
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,228
警察总部里有摄像头
There are cameras inside of 1PP.

480
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,788
他们会知道我是跟这家伙一起离开的 这可是一级谋杀 你知道吗?
People will know that I've left with this guy. We're talking murder one. Don't you get it?

481
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:23,973
就因为这点
That's the point.

482
00:40:23,974 --> 00:40:27,207
你需要有HR的朋友帮你掩护
You'll need your friends at HR to help you cover this up.

483
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,026
我才刚找到点做好人的感觉
I was just starting to enjoy being a good guy for a change.

484
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:34,328
你已经做过好事了 Lionel
You've done some nice work, Lionel.

485
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:37,124
抱歉 但你在内部更有价值
I'm sorry, but you're more useful inside.

486
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:41,365
我的双手一旦肮脏 就永远肮脏 对吧?
My hands are dirty, always will be, huh?

487
00:40:53,677 --> 00:40:56,588
- 我们要带妈妈去医院吗? - 是的 孩子

你要有小弟弟喽
You're about to have a new little brother.

489
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:04,784
我肯定忘东西了 我早就该收拾了
I'm sure I forgot something. I should have packed a week ago.

490
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:14,321
亲爱的 怎么了 你还好吗?
Honey, what is it? You okay?

491
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:18,895
我爱你 很爱你
I love you... So much.

492
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:21,211
我知道
I know.

493
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:28,537
Snow警探已经安排释放L.O.S.了
I thought you might like to know that Agent Snow has arranged the release of L.O.S.

494
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:31,231
一个小时内他就能出来
He'll be out in less than an hour.

495
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:36,760
- 你打算怎么办? - 我会看着Cahill 确保他安然无恙
- What do you plan to do? - I'll keep an eye on Cahill and make sure he stays safe and sound.

496
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:41,363
他就快有宝宝了 到时肯定有的是动静
He's about to have a screaming infant. I doubt he'll be anywhere close to sound.

497
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,230
真可怜
Poor guy.

498
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:01,356
都这么久了 Mark 他们竟然会派你来帮我
It's been a long time, Mark. Surprised they sent you down here for me.

499
00:42:01,357 --> 00:42:03,966
你了解中情局 他们只为自己想
You know the agency. They always take care of their own.

500
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:08,611
整个交易被搞砸了 估计我们亏了两三千万
The whole deal went pear-shaped. Probably cost us 20 million, 30 million.

501
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:11,512
先给我搞定那两个逮捕我的警察
First thing to take care of are those two cops who brought me in...

某个卧底 还有个女警探
Some undercover and a female detective.

503
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:18,753
我给过他们警告了 他们必须滚蛋
I gave them both fair warning. They gotta go.

504
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,785
- 我们得发个信息 - 你总是这么冲动 Ray
We gotta send a message. You're always impulsive, Ray.

505

你不能杀警察
You can't go around killing cops.

506
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:30,349
你也不该让自己被捕 我警告过你
And you really shouldn't have gotten yourself arrested. I warned you.

507
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:33,063
你在这儿可是身处敌后 上车吧
You're behind enemy lines here. Come on.
