1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,118
你正被监视着
You are being watched...

2
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:07,177
政府有一套秘密的系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:11,103
一个无时无刻都在监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:14,140
我知道这些 因为这机器是我造的
I know, because I built it.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,299
我设计这机器是用来查找恐怖活动的 但它却什么都能看到...

00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:22,543
包含普通人的暴力犯罪 像你一样的普通人
Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,

7
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:25,260
政府认为不相干的犯罪
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

8
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,992
他们不作出反应 所以我决定我来做
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,520
但我需要一个拍档...
But I needed a partner--

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,181
拥有干涉这一切的技术的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

11
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:38,321
被当局追捕 我们秘密行事着
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

12
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,130
你永远也不会找到我们 
You'll never find us.

13
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:42,294
但受害者或犯罪者
But victim or perpetrator,

14
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,805
如果你的号码出现的话 我们会找到你
if your number's up, we'll find you.

15

911. What is your emergency? Got a flat tire.

17
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:58,966
他们不肯把音乐关掉
They won't turn their music down.

18
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,279
我刚知道他和她睡一块去了
I just know he's sleeping with her.

19
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,791
请帮帮我! 是我哥
Please help me! It's my brother.

20
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,408
他们枪击了他 求求你 派人来吧
They shot him. Please, send someone.

21
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,082
不好意思 所有线路当前都很繁忙
We're sorry. All circuits are busy at this time.

22
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:23,796
没人在这
Nobody here.

23
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:38,282
我从没见你这样过
I've never seen you like this.

24
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:40,122
那个黑客肯定影响你了
That hacker must have gotten to you.

25
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,671
只有偏执狂才能生存 明智的建议
Only the paranoid survive-- Sage advice.

26
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:48,115
我要从头开始重建整个系统
Well, I'll need to rebuild all my systems from scratch,

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,799
加强防火墙
reinforce the firewall.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,544
- 我能帮忙吗? - 可以
Anything I can do? Yes.

29
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:56,697
新号码
New number...

30
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:01,092
- 今早刚出现 - 图书馆崩了也有?
Just came in this morning. Even with the library offline?

31
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,863
他叫Darren McGrady 14岁
His name is Darren McGrady, 14 years old.

32
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,106
那是最后的已知地址 你最好开始行动了
That's his last known address. You better get started.

33
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,689
嘿 Finch...
Hey, Finch...

34
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,897
你的机器出号码会不会慢了几天?
Any chance your machine gave us the number a few days late?

35
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,827
不会 怎么?
No. Why?

36
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:36,039
因为我要爬过警方的警戒线 才能进入Darren的公寓
Because I had to crawl through police tape to get inside Darren's apartment.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,801
图书馆也许暴露了 但我可以保证机器没有
The library may have been compromised, but I can assure you that the machine was not.

38
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:40,783
不管发生什么
Whatever happened there,

39
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:43,658
Darren肯定正出事着
Darren's situation must be ongoing.

40
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,412
好像是私闯民宅
Looks like a home invasion.

41
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,098
地上的血是谁的?
So whose blood is on the floor?

42
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:58,790
嘿 你是谁?
Hey. Who are you?

43
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,180
Stills探员
Detective Stills.

44
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,093
- 你是管理人? - 没错
- You the super? - That's right.

45
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:07,861
- 现在查案太晚了吧? - 不介意告诉我这里发生什么吧?
A little late for the party, aren't you? Mind telling me what happened here?

46
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:10,807
好像是 其中一个房客被枪杀了
What it looks like-- One of my tenants got shot...

47
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:14,517
大概一周前 大的那个 Travis McGrady
About a week ago. Older kid-- Travis McGrady.

48
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:17,486
太可惜了 他交租很准时
Damn shame. Real good about paying rent on time.

49
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,831
Travis有个弟弟 叫Darren
Travis had a younger brother, Darren.

50
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:22,491
- 他怎么了? - 我不知道
- What happened to him? - I don't know.

51
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,175
他被警察带走
Cops took him with them.

52
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,809
嘿 我什么时候可以清理这里 让新房客入住?
Hey, when can I clean this place up and get a new tenant in here?

53
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,568
早上好探员 想我了?
Morning, Detective. Miss me?

54
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,141
我总是想象你
You know, I always pictured you

55
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,006
出现在我的车后...戴着手铐
in the back of my car... In handcuffs.

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,753
求同存异吧 
Well, to each his own.

57
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:55,228
- 拿到档案了吗? - Travis McGrady
Any luck pulling that file? Travis McGrady--

58
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:57,658
胸部近距离被射中两枪
Took two shots to the chest, point blank.

59
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,294
有人看到三名黑人男性逃离现场
Three black males were seen fleeing the building.

60
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,157
他弟弟怎样 Darren?
What about the brother, Darren?

61
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,506
正好案发后回家 发现Travis失血过多
Came home right after it happened, found Travis bleeding out.

62
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,015
这里记录他拨打911了
Says here he called 911.

63
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:10,116
是 花了半小时才有人出警
Yeah, it took half an hour for first responders to show up.

64
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,121
- Travis已经死亡 - 父母怎么了?
Travis was already dead. What happened to the parents?

65
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:16,984
父亲不详 母亲三年前死于肾衰竭
No father in the picture. Mother died of renal failure three years ago,

66
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:20,358
所以Travis是Darren的合法监护人
so Travis was Darren's legal guardian.

67
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,854
现在他无依无靠了
Now he's got nobody.

68
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,170
- 知道他现在在哪吗? - 失踪
Any idea where he is now? Missing.

69
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:28,546
那孩子在分局等儿童保护机构等了一整晚
Kid waited all night at the precinct for Child Services.

70
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:31,454
看他们没来 他起身就走了
When they didn't show up, he just up and walked out.

71
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,042
我要追踪他...
I need to track him down...

72
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:34,153
- 要快 - 嘿
- Fast. - Hey.

73
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:38,585
不告诉我你和你朋友 是怎样挑选要追踪的人的?
You ever gonna tell me exactly how you and your friend pick the people you're chasing?

74
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:46,904
好的 我会和负责的探员谈
All right. I'll talk to the detective assigned on the case,

75
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:49,430
看看有没有报告漏掉的信息
see if there's anything he left out of that report.

76
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:51,241
比如他是怎样把孩子弄丢了
Like how he lost the kid.

77
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:56,470
凶案调查组怎么想介入Crown高地的枪杀案?
Since when does a homicide task force want in on a shooting in Crown Heights?

78
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,823
你没有更重要的活干吗
Don't you have something more high profile to work--

79
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:01,244
比如老拿枪打别人膝盖那家伙?
Like that guy who's kneecapping everybody?

80
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:04,384
上头想绩效数字好看点
Chief of "D"s wants to polish compstat numbers--

81
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:07,101
命令我们去调查任何悬案
Ordered us to climb on any open cases.

82
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:09,997
好吧 是这样的
Okay. It goes like this.

83
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,952
上周五受害者在工作...
Last Friday the victim was working at the--

84
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:16,657
Travis 对吧? 他叫Travis
Travis, right? His name is Travis.

85
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:19,544
- 没错 - 嗯 这个Travis
Right. Well, this Travis--

86
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:22,195
他在Thighs&Fries上夜班
He's working the late shift at the Thighs & Fries.

87
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,339
因为一个女服务员而与三名男性发生争吵
Got into an altercation with three males over some waitress.

88
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,786
有人嘴巴不干净 Travis上去揍他 打到脱臼
Somebody got frisky, Travis went at him, tossed him out the joint.

89
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:32,194
也就是之后被看到逃离现场的三人
Same three guys seen later fleeing his apartment building.

90
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:36,204
我发现他们离开餐馆后 尾随Travis回家
I figure they left the restaurant. They followed Travis on his way home from work.

91
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:37,283
其它的你都知道了
You know the rest.

92
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:41,212
他弟弟说 他们拿走了他的工作帽
The little brother-- He said, uh, they took his work hat.

93
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,155
有三个嫌疑人的线索吗?
Any leads on the three suspects?

94
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:46,649
- 服务员有给出描述什么的吗? - 在那个街区?
Waitress give a description, anything? In that neighborhood?

95
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:51,247
你说笑呢? 没人敢供出那些暴徒的
Are you kidding? Ain't nobody gonna dime out those thugs.

96
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:54,033
找弟弟Darren有进展了吗?
Any progress on finding the little brother, Darren?

97
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:57,671
- 我哪有精力去找坐不住的孩子啊 - 那当然
I don't have time to chase after every kid - who can't sit still. - Of course not.

98
00:05:57,672 --> 00:05:59,239
我找到他时
When I find him,

99
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,213
我会告诉他你帮了大忙
I'll let him know you were a big help.

100
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:10,734
好像Darren他哥惹错人了
Sounds like Darren's brother picked a fight with the wrong crowd.

101
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:15,684
如果他们认为Darren在那晚看到了什么 接下来会让他永远出不了声
If they think Darren saw anything that night, they'll be looking to silence him next.

102
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:18,412
所以Darren在哪枪手是谁 我们都毫无头绪
So we don't have a clue where Darren is or who the shooters are.

103
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,936
目击证人可以指证枪手 他们只是太害怕
Witnesses can ID the shooters. They're just too scared.

104
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,632
他们怎么会对你开口?
Why would they want to talk to you?

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,063
我自有办法
I have my ways.

106
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:35,516
打扰一下
Excuse me.

107
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:36,668
Lisa?
Lisa?

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,040
不好意思 我要迟到了
Sorry. I'm running late for something.

109
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,454
而且我已经把所知的关于Travis 和那些人的全部告诉给警察了
Besides, I already told the police everything I know about Travis and those guys.

110
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,270
我不是警察
I'm not a cop.

111
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,098
我在找Darren McGrady Travis的弟弟
I'm looking for Darren McGrady, Travis' little brother.

112
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,713
- 对不起 我帮不了你 - 你知道你害怕...
I'm sorry. I can't help you. I know you're afraid...

113
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:54,621
我相信Travis为你挺身而出
Just like I'm sure Travis was scared

114
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,405
对抗那群暴徒时也很害怕
when he stuck up for you against those thugs.

115
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:58,992
但他还是做到了
But he did it anyway.

116
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:06,642
那些人一直来白吃白喝 大喊大叫
Those guys come in there all the time, grabbing and hollering.

117
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,768
我真不知道他是怎么想的
I don't know what the hell he was thinking.

118
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,373
他关心你
He cared for you...

119
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,829
就像关心他的弟弟 Darren
Just like he cared for his little brother, Darren.

120
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,952
杀死Travis的人可能正在追杀Darren
The guys that killed Travis may be coming after Darren now.

121
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,768
我要你帮忙找到他们
I need your help tracking them down.

122
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,006
- 听着 我想帮忙 但是... - 你不用说出名字
Look, I want to help, but-- You don't have to give me a name.

123
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:28,657
帮我指对路就行
Just point me in the right direction.

124
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:36,390
你这种从暗处出现的人 追缉坏人
Guy like you, coming out of the shadows, looking for bad guys,

125
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,866
很适合去漫画书店
you'd fit right in at the comic book store...

126
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,925
过几个街区
Couple blocks that way.

127
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:43,451
他们在那聚集
They hang out there.

128
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:45,812
谢谢
Thanks.

129
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:57,158

132
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:05,026
Wilcox先生 这兄弟的超能力是什么?
Mr. Wilcox, what's this dude's superpower?

133
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,015
没有服装 披肩
He got no costume, no cape.

134
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,485
因为做超级英雄不用任何披肩或斗篷
'Cause being a superhero is not about a cape or a cowl.

135
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,816
而是要保护自己的同伴
It's about protecting your fellow man,

136
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:15,299
在别人无能为力时照看他
looking out for him when no one else will.

137
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,129
看看细节
Look at the detail on that.

138
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,125

Uh... Excuse you.

139
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,938
嘿 Carter 我可能找到其中一个枪手
Hey, Carter, I may have found one of our shooters--

140
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,079
在Crown街和Albany路的拐角 往南走了
Corner of Crown and Albany, headed south.

141
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,218
两分钟路程 就到
I'm two minutes away, be right there.

142
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,253
Finch 我看到Darren了
Finch, I got eyes on Darren.

143
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:36,921
他安全吗 Reese先生?
Is he safe, Mr. Reese?

144
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,988
- 安全不了多久 - 嘿 哟 Brick

把帽子拿下来

Crown街附近有枪声

还不知道警察可以选择接哪个报案呢

167
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:53,867

One of these days I'll have to come up with a good answer for that one.

It's a nice piece, considering you bought it off the street.

170
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,264
- 哪里来的钱? - 把电视典当了 卖点东西
Where'd you get the cash? Pawned a TV, sold some stuff.

171
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:08,499
看到你有吹小号 那个也给当了吧
Saw you play the trumpet. I'm guessing you pawned that too.

我哥想让我去音乐学校...
My brother wanted me to go to music school...

174

看看现在 惹上那群流氓了

你跟踪那个叫Brick的小子
So you tracked down that Brick kid.

177
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:31,153
你认为你哥会希望你这么做?
You think that's what your brother would have wanted you to do?

00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:34,144
看他戴着那顶帽子 好像是战利品一样
Saw him wearing that hat like it was some type of scalp.

179

你?
You?

00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,300
怎么搞?
How?

182
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:46,106

Wait a minute. Where we going?

183

首先你让我调查我们的共同朋友

我有工作的 Carter会问起更多问题

You leave Carter to me. Now, is this place safe?

194
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:22,898
是 她喜欢帮助孩子 讨厌文书工作
Yeah. She likes to help kids. She hates paperwork.

195

- 她一向都收离家少年的 - 我没离家出走
She takes in strays all the time. I'm not a stray.

你戴着死人的帽子招摇过市
You walking around wearing a dead guy's hat.

203
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:07,578
从哪里搞到的?
Where'd you get it?

204
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:08,630

要不你现在就把电话给我

- 没法指控我 你就不能关着我 - 是啊 没错
You can't hold me if you can't charge me. Yeah, that's right.

222
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:06,066
我还在重建驱动 得让硬件运行
I'm still rebuilding the drives. Had to make a hardware run.

223

229
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:26,080

我很好 Harold叔叔
I'm well, Uncle Harold.

231
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,111

232
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:33,917
- 想必生意兴隆吧 - 很高兴 确实是

233
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,180
在保险这行 坏事出得越少

235
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,174
- 等我把这点事处理完 我们去吃午饭 - 慢慢来
Let me tie up a few loose ends, and then we'll go to lunch. Take your time.

236
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,664
- 我基本整理完父亲的遗物了 - 有啥发现么?
I almost finished sorting through all dad's stuff. Find anything interesting?

237
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:48,990
有一两样东西 我相信他想给你
One or two things I'm sure he would have wanted you to have.

238
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:51,508
多数是些无聊物
Mostly it was boring stuff,

239
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,276
除了... 除了这个
except-- except for this,

240
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:55,977
有点诡异
which is just strange.

241
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:06,468
"第一天 那台机器 2005年2月24日"
"Day one: The machine, February 24, 2005."

242
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:09,268
- 很有趣 不是么? - 是么?
It's interesting, isn't it? Is it?

243
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:13,730
我跟你说过我在研究父亲关停公司那段时期
I told you I'm looking into that period when dad shut down operations at the company.

244
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:17,145
这正好在那段时期 显然他在庆祝些什么 但究竟是什么?
This is right in the middle of that. Now, obviously he was celebrating something, but what?

245
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,693
某机器? 这机器?
A machine? The machine?

246
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,375
不晓得 你爸你懂的
I wouldn't know. You know your dad--

247
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,738
- 一有借口就香槟庆祝 - 我猜你说得对
- Any excuse for champagne. - Well, I guess you're right.

248
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:28,605
但我想到还有个人可能知道
But there's still one person who I think of who might know.

249
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,110
你可能也认识她...
You probably know her too...

250
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,330
Alicia Corwin?
Alicia Corwin?

251
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,699
不 觉得不认识
No. I don't think so.

252
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,115
在那七年空白的所有档案中只出现过她的名字 而她还为白宫工作
Hers is the only name that appears in any of the files during that seven-year blackout, and she worked for the White House.

253
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,535
我猜他们为某些事有所接触
I guess they were in touch about something.

254
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:45,110
- 你跟她联系过么? - 挺不容易的
Have you been in contact with her? It wasn't easy.

255
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,024
父亲死后 她在一年前辞掉了政府工作
After she quit her job at the government a year ago after dad died, 

256
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:53,273
她搬到了西弗吉尼亚一个偏僻小镇 绿岸
she moved to this remote town in West Virginia-- Green Bank.

257
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,698
- 从没听说过 - 我也没
- Never heard of it. - Me neither.

258
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,720
结果这是美国唯一一个
Turns out it's the only place in the US.

259
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:00,419
没有手机或无线网络的地方
That doesn't have cell phones or wireless Internet.

260
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,979
显然他们处理了射电望远镜
Apparently, they do something to the radio telescopes.

261
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,873
- 你确定你不是捕风捉影么 Will? - 或许吧 除了一点
Are you sure you're not chasing shadows here, Will? Maybe, except for one thing.

262
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:11,686
还记得父亲与政府签的那个一美元合同么?
Remember that contract that dad signed with the government for $1?

263
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:15,313
就在第二天 2005年2月25日
It's the next day-- February 25th, 2005.

264
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:20,230
哇 确实可疑
Well, that is something.

265
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:23,798
我弄好了 也饿了
I'm finished here, and I'm starving.

266
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,067
我们出去吧
Let's get out of here.

267
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,707
Fusco探员
Detective Fusco.

268
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,704
开玩笑么 啥时候?
You're kidding me. When?

269
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,656
- 你好 Lionel - 嘿 我刚接到教养院的电话
Hello, Lionel. Hey, I just got a call from the group home.

270
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:56,941
Darren失踪了
Darren's missing.

271
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:02,539
- 你这啥意思? 我叫你盯住他 - 我每小时查他岗啊
What do you mean? I told you to check on him. I've been checking on him every hour.

272
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,394
你以为他们为啥打电话给我? 那孩子肯定是走出去了
Why do you think they called me? Kid must have just walked out.

273
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,353
孩子有那样做的习惯
Kid's got a habit of doing that.

274
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,834
那好 说一句 这不是我的错
Yeah, well, just for the record, this is not my fault.

275
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:12,229
为你当私家侦探 忙不过来
Too busy playing private investigator for you.

276
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,367
- 结果呢? - 有趣
- And how's that going? - Interesting.

277
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:17,921
有新消息会告诉你 我们要拿这孩子怎么办?
I'll tell you when I know more. What are we gonna do about this kid?

278
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,088
我猜我知道他可能去的地方
I think I know where he might be headed.

279
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,921
Ferdy's Bur

280
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,286
哟 喝啤酒的...
Yo, Hops & Barley...

281
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:32,005
我在找两个废物
Looking for a couple punks--

282
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,504
Curtis和Trim 你们认识他们不?
Curtis and Trim. You know 'em?

283
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,760
- 说啥? - 你听到我说的了
- Say what? - You heard me--

284
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:43,150
Curtis和Trim 我直呼他们名字
Curtis and Trim. I'm calling 'em out.

285
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,491
你是在找死么 好斗小子?
You trying to get yourself killed, Scrappy Doo?

286
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:49,994
你快让我不耐烦了 你也许怕他们 但我不怕
You're beginning to wear my last nerve. You might be scared of 'em, but I'm not.

287
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:51,889
你个侏儒快被扔出门了
You about to get yourself tossed, dwarf.

288
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,847
除非你愿意听他的
Not unless you care to follow him.

289
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:56,237
放这孩子走如何?
Why not let the kid go?

290
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,001
要是我不呢?
And if I don't?

291
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,676
Oh, boom!

292
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:19,794
哟 那是真格的少林和武当神功
Yo, now, that was some straight-up Shaolin and wu-tang whup-ass.

293
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:21,754
那是什么搏击术啊?
What kind of fighting style is that?

294
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,672
你是个聪明有天分的孩子 Darren
You're a smart, talented kid, Darren.

295
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:28,509
你要向我保证 别去找这些人了
You got to promise me that you'll stop looking for these guys.

296
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,660
你在外头太危险了
It's too dangerous for you out there.

297
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:43,098
这是啥?
What's this?

298
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,999
我只剩这些了
It's all I got left.

299
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,662
我想雇你帮我消灭那些害死我哥哥的人
I want to hire you to help me take down those guys who killed my brother.

300
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:50,564
假设我不是警察 而是职业杀手 是这意思么?
So, if I'm not a cop, I'm a mercenary, is that it?

301
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:54,807
不 我判断出来了 你是个浪人
No, I figured it out. You're a ronin.

302
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:58,075
- 浪人? - 对 浪人
A ronin? Yeah, a ronin.

303
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:02,002
就是 就是没有主人的武士
It's like-- It's like a samurai with no master.

304
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,022
严格来说 你该剖腹
Technically, you should have killed yourself.

305
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,185
那是规则
That's the code.

306
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,873
但你选择云游四方
But instead you're out wandering the land,

307
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,249
救苦救难
helping people.

308
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:15,924
- 所以现在我雇你帮我 - 我不受雇
So now I'm paying you to help me. I'm not for hire.

309
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,036
你不能阻止我找他们
You can't stop me from going after them.

310
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:21,458
但我有你在旁胜算更大
But I have a better chance with you there.

311
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:24,908
没办法说服你低调点 哈?
There's no way to convince you to just lie low, huh?

312
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,879
你把钱留着吧
You can keep your money.

313
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,261
别 伙计 收下
Nah, man. Take it.

314
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,041
- 就算正式成交了 - 不
- It makes it official. - No.

315
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,313
如果我们要做这件事 就得按我的方法来
If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it my way.

316
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:42,684
意味着不杀人
That means no killing.

317
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,070
这是我的现行收费标准
This is my going rate.

318
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,194
好吧 伙计 成交
All right, man, deal.

319
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,530
你现在为我工作 我该知道你名字
Look, you're working for me now. I ought to know your name.

320
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:59,395
呃 你可以叫我...
Uh, you can call me..

321
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:00,858
Reese
Reese.

322
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:19,891
他在干嘛?
What's he doing, man?

323
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:24,190
- 喂 喂 嘿! 你们这么脏 别靠近我的干净车 - 我的错! 我的错!
Yo, yo, hey! Keep your dirty ass - away from my clean car. - My bad! My bad!

324
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,058
喂 我不是雇你坐在这儿看戏的
I didn't hire you to just sit here and watch.

325
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,209
我们什么时候打倒他们?
When are we gonna take them down?

326
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,871
我们已经开始了 第一步 观察
We've already started. Step one-- Observe.

327
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:37,558
最快输掉战斗的方式 就是不了解对手而贸然行动
The most efficient way to lose a fight is to act without knowing your enemy.

328
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:40,369
你好 交钱日 老伙计
Payday, old man.

329
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,285
- 全交了 300块 - 那是保护费
It's all there-- $300. That's protection.

330
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:53,639
- 其他的呢? - 行行好 伙计们
- Where's the rest? - Oh, come on, guys.

331
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,747
如果州府发现我在卖那些票 我会失去合法彩票生意
If the state found out I was selling those tickets, I'd lose my legit lottery business.

332
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,286
彩票?
Tickets?

333
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:01,879
对 他们通过当地店主卖私彩
Yeah, they're running numbers through local shop owners,

334
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,066
但他们拿走所有钱 不缴税
but they take all the money, tax-free.

335
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,226
警察知不知道 还是根本不关心?
The cops know about this, or they just don't care?

336
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:08,945
多半分了警察一份 让他们睁只眼闭只眼
Probably giving them a cut to turn a blind eye.

337
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,988
你没交够钱 Andre 你的损失会多得多
You short Andre, you'll lose a lot more.

338
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,116
- 谁是Andre? - 不认识
- Who's Andre? - I don't know.

339
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,909
警察放任这些家伙为所欲为
Man, these cops let these guys do whatever they want--

340
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:21,117
杀了我哥哥 横行乡里无所顾忌
Kill my brother, walk around like they can't be touched.

341
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:23,576
但现在我们知道 他们怎么赚钱了
But now we know how they're making their money.

342
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:26,720
他们的弱点暴露出来了
So they just got a lot less untouchable.

343
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:29,260
啊 "观察"
Ah... "Observe."

344
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,988
实话说 我一直讨厌观察 你等着
To tell you the truth, I've always hated observing.

345
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,789
你快付钱 否则有你好看
Wait here. You paying up, or we got a problem?

346
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,168
赶紧 老头
Hurry up, pops.

347
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,989
只剩几家了 伙计 我们快完成了
Just a couple more to go, man, we'll be good.

348
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:55,238
喂! 噢哇!
Yo! Oh, whoa!

349
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,883
那是我的车!
That's my car!

350
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,637
那是第二步 娃
That was step two, kid.

351
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,472
在Rutland路和52街路口会合
Meet me at the corner of Rutland and 52nd.

352
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,308
嘿 咋了伙计? Trim的车在哪?
Hey, what's up, man? Where's Trim's car?

353
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,228
策略性储存了
Strategically stored.

354
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:26,066
我要敲山震虎... 看有啥秘密泄露
I just needed to shake 'em up a bit... See what comes loose.

355
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,377
酷 酷
Cool, cool.

356
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:32,202
- 我需要他们手机的卫星定位 - 等下
I need GPS on their cell. Just a minute.

357
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:35,760
我不太支持你和小Darren的麻烦安排
I'm not sure I'm in favor of your troubling arrangement with young Darren.

358
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:39,112
我也对我们的麻烦安排心存疑虑
I'm not sure I'm in favor of our troubling arrangement,

359
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:42,459
特别是在你去处理神秘事务而失踪时
especially when you disappear on mysterious business.

360
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,135
卫星定位在找了 Reese先生
GPS is up, Mr. Reese.

361
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:49,268
- 你在跟谁讲话? - 技术支援 来吧
Who are you talking to? Tech support. Come on.

362
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:55,363
嘿 你杀过人么?
Hey, you ever kill anyone?

363
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:58,741
杀过
Yes.

364
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,393
他们是坏人么?
Were they bad?

365
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:02,350
有些...不全是
Some...

366
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,019
有些?
Not all. Some?

367
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,018
所以说你主人骗了你
That means your master tricked you,

368
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,772
命令你去杀其实不坏的人
told you to kill bad people that really weren't.

369
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,819
很多浪人都是这种命
A lot of ronin ended up that way.

370
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,422
知道我怎么想么 T? 我想你的车没了
You know what I think, T? I think your ride's gone, yo.

371
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:21,112
- 闭嘴 Curtis - 那...第三步?
Shut up, Curtis. So...Step three?

372
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:25,260
把你的意志强加于敌人 直捣他们弱点
To impose your will on your enemy, make for their weak points.

373
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,476
啊 在讲战争艺术
Oh. Talking <i>art of war.</i>

374
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:30,977
你读《孙子兵法》?
You read Sun Tzu?

375
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,236
当然咯 伙计 所有武士都知道孙子
Of course, man. All samurai know Sun Tzu.

376
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,388
行了 伙计
Come on, man.

377
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:39,283
弄辆新车 打电话理赔
Just get a new car. Call for the insurance.

378
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,861
啥理赔?
What insurance?

379
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:42,929
偷车的时候你和我在一起
You were with me when I stole the damn thing.

380
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,109
对 但你买了那些轮框 他们可以赔那些
Yeah, but you bought those rims. They might replace those.

381
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,788
- 你个蠢货站起来 - 冷静 伙计!
Get your dumb ass up, man. Chill, man!

382
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:51,538
去把你祖母的Beater开来 在Andre的店和我会合
Go get your grandma's beater and meet me at Andre's.

383
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,078
今晚要收很多钱
Big money run tonight. Steps four and five--

384
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,135
第四第五步 找到幕后指使 找出打击他的办法 来吧
Find the boss and figure out how to hurt him. Come on.

385
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:04,648
你关押的那个火爆小子犯啥事了?
What's the story on that banger you're holding?

386
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,178
- 能起诉了么? - 他是一起枪击案的涉案人
You got a charge yet? His name came up in a shooting.

387
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,040
我在等一组照片
I'm just waiting for a photo packet.

388
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,544
明天之前我们都可控告他 队长
We have until tomorrow to arraign him, captain.

389
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:14,130
- 我仍在收集证据 - 快没时间了 Carter
- I'm still collecting evidence. - You're reaching, Carter.

390
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,036
如果那孩子5点前没被控告 我希望你把他放了
If that kid's not arraigned by 5:00, I want you to kick him.

391
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,538
喂 Reese 那是Trim
Yo, Reese, there's Trim.

392
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:30,403
- 他在这边干嘛? - 现在 记住 重点不是超能力
What's he doing back here? Now, remember, it's not about the superpowers.

393
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:32,761
而在于谁保护你 让你安全
It's about who protects you and who keeps you safe.

394
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,215
回家去
Go on home.

395
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:37,332
天 他们也让Wilcox先生卖这些彩票?
Man, they got Mr. Wilcox selling those tickets too?

396
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:41,691
恐怕没这么简单
I'm not sure it's that simple.

397
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:43,566
你们来晚了
You're late.

398
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,379
车出了点问题 Andre
Had a little car trouble, Andre.

399
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,164
- 那是Andre? - 爬得越高
That's Andre? The higher up you go,

400
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:52,573
越难分辨好人和坏人
the harder it gets to tell the good guys from the bad.

401
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,246
- 警方还关押着Brick? - Brick的事我来处理
Police still got Brick? Let me worry about Brick.

402
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:04,084
你们开来的Beater咋回事?
What's with the beater you rolled up in?

403
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,171
呃 是我祖母的
Uh, it's my grandma's.

404
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,512
- 你们运我的五十万 要用那辆... - 那就是我们开那辆车的原因 Andre
You're gonna move half a million dollars of my money - in that piece-- - That's why we got it, Andre--

405
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:12,424
换辆车 换条路线 以策安全
Switching up the cars, switching up the routes, just to be safe.

406
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:14,734
我仍然一眼看出你在撒谎
I still smell you lying a mile away.

407
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:17,469
不 是真话 自从警察抓了Brick 我们想也许...
No, for real. Since the cops got Brick, we thought maybe--

408
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,436
你们不必操心Brick 你们只需操心我
You don't need to worry about Brick. All you need to do is worry about me.

409
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,586
做我叫你们做的 拿给我我想要的
Do whatever I tell you to do, get me whatever I want, and right now

410
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:27,586
而现在 我想今晚把我的钱运到布莱顿海滩
I want my damn money in Brighton Beach tonight.

411
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:31,529
要是搞砸这事 我定会杀了你们
Now y'all mess that up, and I'm gonna kill you both.

412
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:38,143
现在我们知道谁弱小 谁掌权
Now we know who's weak, who's in charge,

413
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:41,496
以及怎么打击他 第六步是什么 伙计?
and how to hurt him. What's step six, man?

414
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,948
那是好玩的部分 来吧
Well, that's the fun part. Come on.

415
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:56,076
- 你觉得Brick会招供么? - Brick挺得住
Yo, you think Brick's gonna talk? Brick is cool.

416
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,736
Andre会保护他
Andre will protect him.

417
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:01,329
Andre会照顾我们所有人 只要我们帮他做事
Andre will take care of all of us, as long as we take care of him.

418
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:06,393
Trim 那不是你的车么?
Trim, ain't that your ride?

419
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,659
你的车找到了
Found your car.

420
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,560
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

421
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,856
这可不是你睡觉的地方 哥们
Wrong place to sleep it off, buddy.

422
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,660
你和我需要谈谈
You and I need to talk.

423
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:11,274
- 我忙着呢 Carter - 我听说你出了个小车祸
In the middle of something, Carter. I heard about your little traffic accident.

424
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:13,322
你把那孩子卷进去干什么?
What have you gotten that kid mixed up in?

425
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:16,680
- 别担心 他不在车里 - 那孩子是未成年人
Don't worry. He wasn't in the car. That boy is a minor.

426
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:19,645
- 你要对他的人身安全负责任 - Brick还在你手里?
You're responsible for his welfare. You still have Brick?

427
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:22,606
嗯 Womack以为我今天早上把他放了呢
Yeah, Womack thinks I released him this morning.

428
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:25,101
昨天晚上你撞的那个人呢?
What about that other guy you slammed into last night?

429
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,116
他会告诉我们Travis McGrady谋杀案的情况的
He's about to debrief us on Travis McGrady's murder.

430
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:31,874
要是你愿意 喊破喉咙都没关系
You can scream if you want.

431
00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:33,555
去你丫的
Kiss my ass.

432
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:40,153
- 你把枪扔哪了? - 什么枪?
Where'd you dump the gun? What gun?

433
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,312
你杀Travis McGrady用的那把枪
The gun you used to kill Travis McGrady.

434
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,734
Travis什么?
Travis who?

435
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:02,590
这钱本该送到布莱顿海滩
This money is supposed to be in Brighton Beach.

436
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:07,822
问题是... 它现在跟你在Crown高地
Trouble is... It's here with you in Crown Heights.

437
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,189
Andre会杀了你的
Andre's gonna kill you.

438
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:15,059
你真认为Andre会相信你的话?
Do you really think Andre would believe your story?

439
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:19,503
如果我是Andre 我会认为你偷走了所有的钱
If I were Andre, I'd assume you stole every dime.

440
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,550
我会派人把钱找到
I'd send people in to find it,

441
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,694
然后干掉你
then kill you.

442
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:27,698
所以你活命的唯一办法
So the only way you're gonna survive

443
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:30,067
就是你带着钱一分不少地回去
is if you come back with every last dime.

444
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:37,766
是谁杀了Travis McGrady?
So who killed Travis McGrady?

445
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,981
现在你的命可是值50万
Right now your life is worth a half a million dollars.

446
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,792
两万块...
$20,000 of it...

447
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,232
就这么化为青烟了
Up in smoke.

448
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:56,795
枪在哪 Curtis?
Where's the gun, Curtis?

449
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:02,570
五万块化为青烟了
$50,000 of your life up in smoke.

450
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:09,044
Andre会相信我的
Andre's gonna believe me.

451
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,162
我们走着瞧
Let's find out.

452
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:15,126
什么? 不! 住手 住手 住手!
What? No! Stop, stop, stop!

453
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,757
杀人凶器在哪呢?
Where's the murder weapon?

454
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,303
烟囱...
Chimney...

455
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,403
我奶奶的房子那
Top of my grandma's building.

456
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:31,202
最好在那里
It better be.

457
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:37,725
- 你好 Will 好久不见 - 谢谢你能见我 Alicia
Hello, Will. Long time. Thanks for meeting me, Alicia.

458
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,815
我们要不找间咖啡店或者酒吧...
Maybe we should go to a cafe or bar--

459
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:44,152
- 找个暖和点的地方 - 如果你不介意 我更愿意在外面谈
Somewhere warm. If you don't mind, I prefer it outside.

460
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,209
很抱歉我没能参加你父亲的葬礼
I'm so sorry I couldn't make your father's funeral.

461
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:52,038
我真的很想到场
I really wanted to be there.

462
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:56,288
只不过那段时间对我来说太困难了
It was just a difficult time for me.

463
00:29:56,288 --> 00:30:00,257
- 他人那么好 - 我只是希望我能多了解他一些
He was such a lovely man. I just wish I'd known him better.

464
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:01,691
给
Here.

465
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,969
这是我想见你的原因 我在他的遗物里发现了这个
That's why I wanted to meet you. I found it in his things.

466
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,895
我想知道你对此知道些什么
I wondered if you knew anything about it.

467
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:12,660
他第二天跟政府签了一份价值一美元的合同
Well, he signed a contract with the government the next day for $1.

468
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:15,392
- 什么合同? - 我不知道 上面只写了 "服务"
For what? I don't know. It just said "services."

469
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:18,055
但我很肯定这和
But I'm pretty sure that it had something to do

470
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:21,293
IFT要倒闭时 他的工作有关
with the work he was doing at IFT while they were closed.

471
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:23,447
我希望你能告诉我
I was hoping you could tell me.

472
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:30,183
你真的确定你想要知道吗?
Are you really sure you want to know?

473
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,193
是的 我想知道
Yes, I do.

474
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,071
IFT当时快倒闭了 你爸爸的投资不尽人意
IFT was about to fail. Your dad's investments had backfired.

475
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,982
他的研发部门好几年都没出什么成果
His R&D had produced nothing for years.

476
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,636
他向我寻求帮助
He came to me for help.

477
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:48,313
我说服政府帮他渡过难关
I persuaded the government to bail him out

478
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:51,668
用IFT的几个专利作为条件
in exchange for some of IFT's patents.

479
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:55,119
就是这么回事? 一美元买爸爸的专利?
That's what this is about-- A dollar for dad's patents?

480
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,600
- 我想是这样的 - 所以这是政府在帮他
I'm afraid so. So this is about the government helping him

481
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:02,550
或是毁他 可为什么要喝香槟呢?
or screwing him, but why drink champagne?

482
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:04,689
"那台机器"又是什么意思呢?
And what does it mean-- "The machine"?

483
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,348
是被机器压垮了的意思吗?
Crushed by the machine?

484
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,980
我想是的 在某种程度上
I suppose, yes, in a way,

485
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:12,793
他被机器压垮了...
he was crushed by the machine--

486
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:16,336
先后经历了离婚 公司倒闭
Going through a divorce, his company collapsing.

487
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:18,642
你爸爸那时非常痛苦
Your dad was in a dark place.

488
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,780
我知道想到他最后的日子是这个样子的 一定很难受
I know it must be tough to think of his final days that way,

489
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,563
但放手吧 Will
but let it go, Will.

490
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:28,424
你的话和Harold叔叔如出一辙
You sound just like my Uncle Harold.

491
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,887
是吗? 他是谁?
I do? Who's he?

492
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,748
我爸爸最好的朋友... Harold Wren
My dad's best friend-- Harold Wren.

493
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,880
你确定你俩从没见过面吗?
Are you sure you two never met?

494
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:39,138
没有
No.

495
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:43,021
我们没见过 我得走了
We haven't. I have to go.

496
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:45,066
抱歉我帮不上你什么忙了
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

497
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:56,240
我的货被人截了 队长
My delivery was intercepted, captain.

498
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:59,673
我的两个手下和布莱顿海滩的五十万都不见了
I'm missing two couriers and half a million dollars in Brighton Beach money.

499
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,270
我需要你的帮助
Okay, I need your help.

500
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,307
- 你这次得自己摆平这事了 - 这超出我能力范围了啊
You're on your own with this one. This was out of my control.

501
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:07,434
不可抗力不在我们的保护范围之内
Force majeure is not covered by our protection.

502
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:10,310
我们的合伙人把这次失败都怪罪在你头上了
Our associates blame you for this debacle.

503
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:11,897
搞定这事... 赶紧的
Fix it...Fast.

504
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:13,925
好吧 我会搞定这事的...
All right, I'll handle this...

505
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:17,802
- 靠我自己 - 我对你的成功很有信心
On my own. I'm confident in your success.

506
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,807
但我需要你帮我个忙
I need something from you.

507
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:22,960
我的人Brick
My employee Brick is being held

508
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,469
被你们的人无缘无故地关起来了 我要你把他弄出来...
by your people without a charge, okay? I need you to get him out...

509
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:29,915
除非这也不在你们的保护范围之内
Unless that's not covered by your protection.

510
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,221
我会尽力的
I'll see what I can do.

511
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,534
你好吗 警探?
How are you, Detective?

512
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:44,361
他是你的朋友?
That's a friend of yours?

513
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,914
是的
Yeah.

514
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:53,502
Carter 你还羁押着那个嫌疑人?
Carter, you still have that suspect in holding?

515
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:56,331
- 我刚要放他走来着 - 你好几个小时前就应该那么做了
I was just about to let him go. You should have done that hours ago.

516
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:59,922
这么做可不明智 警探 现在就把嫌疑人给我放了
Not a bright move, Detective. Release the suspect now.

517
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,172
抱歉我之前以为你是警察呢
Sorry I thought you were a cop.

518
00:33:09,172 --> 00:33:11,171
警察本身并没什么错...
Nothing wrong with cops...

519
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:13,643
只不过其中也有害群之马罢了
Just bad ones.

520
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,426
那是什么? 看啊
What's that? Look.

521
00:33:16,435 --> 00:33:18,097
那里有金属的东西
Something metal right there.

522
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,557
我们找到了 孩子
We got 'em, kid.

523
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:29,003
这件事结束了 我们找到证据了
It's over. We got the evidence.

524
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:33,141
我警队的朋友会把Brick和他的朋友抓起来的
My friend on the police force will be able to put Brick and his friends away.

525
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:36,015
没错 那Andre呢? 他还逍遥法外呢
Yeah, but what about Andre? He's still out there.

526
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,314
Andre没有杀你的哥哥
Andre didn't kill your brother.

527
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,355
现在你又想对付他了?
Now you want to go after him too?

528
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,552
当然 这事他也脱不了干系
Hell, yeah. He's just as to blame.

529
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,629
那然后呢?
Then what, hmm?

530
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:50,046
对付Andre的头儿... 腐败的警察和政客们
Go after Andre's bosses... The corrupt cops and the politicians

531
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:51,438
那些默许他们为非作歹的人们?
that let them operate?

532
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:54,428
除非你把你认为与你哥哥的死有关系的 每个人都毁掉 否则你是不会罢手的
You won't be able to stop until you destroy everyone you blame

533
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:58,289
可这也不能让他复活
for taking your brother's life. It won't bring him back.

534
00:34:01,187 --> 00:34:04,144
你最后不是进监狱就是横尸街头
You'll just wind up in jail or dead.

535
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,971
你觉得你哥哥想让你这样吗?
Do you think that's what your brother wanted for you?

536
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:20,287
- 你终于打来了 - 匿名报告 警探
There you are. Anonymous tip just came in, Detective.

537
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,430
找到凶器了 你可以起诉Brick了
Got you the murder weapon. You can go ahead and charge Brick.

538
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:27,752
这可能有点困难 我10分钟前刚把他放走
It's gonna be kind of difficult. I just released him ten minutes ago.

539
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:31,125
- Brick被放出去了? - Womack强迫我这么做的
Brick's on the street? Womack forced my hand.

540
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,097
他会向Andre指认Darren的 
He'll be able to ID Darren to Andre.

541
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:36,980
现在你要做的就是别让那孩子露面
All the more reason why you need to get that kid off the street now.

542
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:37,432
别担心...
Don't worry--

543
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:39,932
枪和孩子都在我这里
I'll get you the gun, along with the kid.

544
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:46,257
- Darren - 出什么事了?
- Darren. - What's going on?

545
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:52,441
Carter...
Carter...

546
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,423
你该说 "我早就告诉过你了"
You're gonna say, "I told you so."

547
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:07,520
Finch Darren跑了 可能又去找Brick了
Finch, Darren's run off, probably to go after Brick again.

548
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:11,326
这次他手里有他们用来杀死他哥哥的枪
And this time he's got the gun they used to kill his brother.

549
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,730
换句话说 让14岁的孩子雇你
In other words, the idea of letting a 14-year-old hire you

550
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:16,919
- 给他哥哥报仇这主意失败了? - 你能晚点再说我吗
to avenge his brother has backfired? You can lecture me later.

551
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,139
现在我需要你把包给我拿过来
Right now I need you to bring me the bag.

552
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,221
- 哪个包? - 贴着"'B'计划"的那个包
Which bag? The one labeled "plan 'B'".

553
00:35:23,682 --> 00:35:26,445
- 嘿 你需要帮手吗?  - 我不知道 你觉得呢?
Hey. You need backup? I don't know. Do I?

554
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:29,841
我认为这事和队长让你扔回海里的那条鱼有关系
I figured it might've had something to do with that fish the captain had you throw back in the sea.

555
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:33,347
可能吧 我得到了一条线报
It might. I got a tip.

556
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:34,744
想去钓鱼吗?
You want to go fishing?

557
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:39,136
当然 为毛不去呢?
Yeah, sure, why not?

558
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,282
这就是那孩子?
That's the kid?

559
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:07,339
Darren 对吧? 没错 我认出你了
Darren, right? Yeah, I recognize you.

560
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,656
我们得谈谈 对吧 你和我?
We got something to talk about, right, you and me?

561
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,301
Plan B

562
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,632
Darren在里面呢
Darren's in there.

563
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:29,411
放轻松 Finch 里面装的是微创子弹 非致命性武器
Relax, Finch. It's bean-bag rounds, riot ammo.

564
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,676
我告诉过那孩子不许杀人
I told the kid no killing.

565
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:35,263
我一给你信号 你就去掐断大楼的供电系统
On my signal, you're gonna cut the power to the building.

566
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,510
刚就是我的信号啊 Finch
That was the signal, Finch.

567
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:43,104
你一个人来这真是勇敢啊 Darren
It's pretty brave of you coming in here like that, Darren.

568
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:45,750
我明白 我真的明白
I get it. I do.

569
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:47,632
我的人杀死了你哥哥
My man took someone from you,

570
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,548
所以你来这要取走他的性命
so you're here to take him from me.

571
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:53,201
所以尽管杀死他吧
So go ahead and shoot him.

572
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:57,278
我是说 他是那个失手在先的人 是他让我们置于如此田地的
I mean, he's the one that screwed up in the first place, even put us in this situation.

573
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:58,580
所以你不如帮我个忙
So you're doing me a favor here.

574
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:00,700
- 喂 Andre... - 你丫闭嘴
- Yo, Andre-- - Shut your mouth.

575

I see you got it in you.

576
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,529
没错 你有这种信念
Yeah, you got that conviction.

577
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:10,960
这是一种很坚强的品质
It's a hard quality to find around here.

578
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:14,724
所以你尽管扣动扳机
So you go ahead and pull that trigger.

579
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,999
你应该来给我效力
You should come work for me.

580
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,513
你很年轻 等你到了Brick这个岁数
You're young enough, by the time you Brick's age,

581
00:37:22,513 --> 00:37:24,660
你就能帮我管理这片地盘了 孩子
you'll be running these streets for me, son.

582
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,028
没人敢碰你一根汗毛 你知道为什么吗?
Ain't nobody gonna touch you. You know why?

583
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,969
因为你比他们都要聪明
Because you smarter than the rest.

584
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,352
现在 你一路走到了这里
Now, you made it all the way here.

585
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,252
开枪吧...
Go ahead...

586
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,173
领走你的奖赏

领走它吧
Claim it.

588
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,003
拜托 快点啊
Man, come on, come on.

589
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:52,092
没错 我想到会是这种结果
Yeah, I thought that might happen.

590
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,024
我不怪你 这都怪书店
I don't blame you. I blame the store.

591
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:00,575
孩子们一天到晚地看那些复仇的故事
Kids spending their days reading these revenge stories,

592
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:02,692
以为那就是真的
selling it like it's reality.

593
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:05,511
但你知道漫画书的真相吗?
But you know the thing about comic books?

594
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,915
它们终究不过是漫画
They're just comics.

595
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,474
怎么会这样? 怎么会这样?
What the hell is that? What the hell is that?

596
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:17,072
走!
Move!

597
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:24,710
去后面
Go around back.

598
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:29,596
纽约警察 放下武器
NYPD, drop your weapon.

599
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:36,163
趴下 孩子!
Get down, kid!

600
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,277
Fusco!
Fusco!

601
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:53,883
Fusco 你还好吗?
Fusco, you okay?

602
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:56,198
- 嗯 我还好 - 过来
- Yeah, just peachy. - Come here.

603
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:10,741
你知道吗? 不管你要说什么 都别说了
You know what? Whatever you got to say, save it.

604
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:13,350
我已经可以看到我回去以后 桌子上的屁股状蛋糕了
I can already see the ass cake on my desk when I get back.

605
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,835
不 事实上我只是想说声谢谢
No, man, actually, I just wanted to say thank you

606
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:18,404
谢谢你救了我一命
for saving my life.

607
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,097
不客气
You're welcome, kid.

608
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,612
来吧 我们走 把我从这弄走吧
Come on. Let's go. Get me out of here.

609
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,513
嘿 轻点 行吗?
Hey, take it easy, will you?

610
00:39:33,097 --> 00:39:37,072
- 我还以为你会留下来呢 - 在曼哈顿 你懂的...
Just when I thought you were sticking around. Manhattan, you know...

611
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:38,572
我就会有点幽闭恐惧的感觉
Got a little claustrophobic.

612
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:42,292
- 苏丹正好有份工作 - 我很难过你又要离开了
And a job's come up in Sudan. I'll be sorry to lose you again.

613
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:47,013
那个女人... 我不记得她的名字了
That woman-- I've forgotten her name.

614
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:48,937
她告诉你你想知道的事情了吗?
Did she tell you what you wanted to know?

615
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:51,583
Alicia Corwin... 她告诉了我一些事情
Alicia Corwin-- She told me some stuff.

616
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:55,955
我不知道那是不是我想知道的 你知道 我一直把我父亲当做我的偶像
I don't know if it's what I wanted to know. You know, I had my dad on a pedestal.

617
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:59,353
爱他也好 恨他也罢 但我一直很崇拜他
Loved him, hated him, but just always admired him.

618
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:01,410
所以很难想象他不过也是个普通人
It's kind of hard to believe he was just an ordinary guy,

619
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:03,759
像普通人一样也会犯错误
made mistakes like everybody else.

620
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:07,622
不管她跟你说了什么 有一件事你应该知道
Well, whatever she told you, there's one thing you should know about him.

621
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:11,589
不管什么时候 不管什么人问他 他最自豪的成就是什么
Anytime anyone ever asked him what his proudest achievement was,

622
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,098
他都会说是你
he always said that it was you.

623
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:17,144
谢谢
Thank you.

624
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:22,378
- 照顾好自己 - 嗯
- Take care of yourself. - Yeah.

625
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:33,426
Fusco告诉我他们给你找了个收养家庭 
You know, Fusco tells me they got a lead on a foster family.

626
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:36,007
我有家
I had a family.

627
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:40,747
Darren 我们对发生在我们身上的事无能为力...
Darren, we don't get to choose what happens to us...

628
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:43,938
但我们可以选择不同的应对方式 我调查过他们
Just what we do about it. I looked into them.

629
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:48,096
- 他们人不错 - 如果他们对我不好呢?
They're good people. And if they aren't?

630
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,160
那我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

631
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,018
我还是会为你效劳的
I'm, uh, still on the clock.

632
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:02,955
我想画得更好一些 但是给...
I'm still working on it, but here...

633
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:04,345
这是给你的
This is yours.

634
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:06,494
你是这么认为的啊?
Would you look at that?

635
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:10,499
我一直想要一个好搭档
I always wanted a sidekick.

636
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:13,240
多谢了
Thanks.

637
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:17,232
这让我想到...
Which, uh, reminds me...

638
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:19,356
我找了找人
I pulled some strings.

639
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:23,758
你可以去读艺术了
You'll be starting at that charter school for the arts.

640
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:25,035
我的小号
My trumpet.

641
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:28,197
- 他们那也有绘画课 - 是吗?
They got drawing classes too. Is that right?

642
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:30,951
记住 抓住机会 等于机会加倍
Remember, opportunities multiply as they're seized.

643
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,616
孙子说的... 没错
Sun Tzu... Right.

644
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:36,970
嘿 别担心
Hey, don't worry, man.

645
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,921
总有一天 你也会找到一个家的
Someday you'll find a home too.

646
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:44,570
谢谢
Thanks.

647
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:47,640
来吧 孩子 他们在屋里等你呢
Come on, kid, they're waiting for you inside.

648
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,433
好的
All right, man.

649
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:52,922
怎么了 Fusco?
What's up, Fusco?

650
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,315
嘿 我觉得你另一半屁股上
Hey, man, I think you're gonna need a bullet

651
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:57,502
也应该挨个枪子 就不这么一瘸一拐的了
in that other cheek to even out that limp.

652
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,474
我也很高兴见到你
Good to see you too.

653
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,878
走吧
Come on.

654
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,389
他是个好孩子
He's a good kid.

655
00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:19,154
- 你觉得他会渡过这个难关吗? - 他是个坚强的孩子
Think he'll be all right? He's a tough kid.

656
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:21,237
我们及时出现是件好事情
It's a good thing we showed up in time, you know.

657
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:24,930
你跟Carter走得太近了 据我所知 她还在寻找你 
You're cutting it awfully close with Carter. She's still looking for you, last I checked.

658
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:28,575
我之前说过 Carter的事情我来担心
Like I said, you let me worry about Carter.

659
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:31,551
- 那件事有什么新消息吗? - 有的
Any news on that other thing? Yeah.

660
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,890
他有很多化名 我甚至不知道从哪里着手
He's got so many aliases, I don't even know where to start.

661
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:38,052
我能查到的最老的一个是Harold Wren
Oldest one I could find is a Harold Wren.

662
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:40,882
他担任一家保险公司的承销商很多年了
He's an underwriter for an insurance company for a number of years.

663
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:43,774
在那之前 他是MIT的学生 他们班的尖子
Before that, MIT student, top of his class.

664
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:45,729
在那里他遇见了那孩子的爸爸...
It was there where he met the kid's dad--

665
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,492
Nathan Ingram
You know, Nathan Ingram.

666
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:50,046
他是那个前几年被杀死的亿万富豪
He's that billionaire that got killed a couple years back.

667
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:51,772
Ingram...
Ingram...

668
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,865
和Wren是一个班的同学
Graduated from the same class as Wren.

669
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,554
没错 除了我还多调查了一点
Yeah, except I did a little more digging.

670
00:42:56,555 --> 00:42:59,272
Wren是他在MIT第一年用的名字
Wren was the name he used freshman year at MIT.

671
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:02,228
那个名字在1976年前没有任何记录
That name doesn't appear on any records before '76,

672
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:04,793
也就是说Wren也是个假身份
which tells me that Wren was a false identity too.

673
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:06,743
这个人花了大把的时间去假装别人
This guy spent so much time being someone else,

674
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:08,861
他可能都不知道自己的本来面目了
he probably doesn't know who he is anymore.

675
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:11,979
"只有偏执狂才能生存" (Andrew S Grove的一本著作)
"Only the paranoid survive."

676
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,928
你知道的 Lionel...
You know, Lionel...

677
00:43:14,701 --> 00:43:18,220
要不是你曾经犯下的过错 你可以是一个相当好的警察的
You could have been a good cop if not for a few bad choices.

678
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:20,133
你让我调查你的老板
You got me snooping around your boss,

679
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,855
但我这样做还不对?
but I make bad choices?

680
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,213
人总得有立场
Man has a point.
