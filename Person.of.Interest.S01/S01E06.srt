00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,130
政府有一套秘密系统

一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,390
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密行动
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,940
你永远也找不到我们

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,650
他妻子

159
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,990
劳森先生马上要接手维尔塔宁制药

160
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,950
他已经负责了日常的工作

161
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,360
但他的老丈人目前还是总裁
But his father-in-law's still the CEO.

162
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,110
而他老头子并不知情
What the old man doesn't know...

163
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,230
塔伯特想要什么
What's Talbott asking?

164
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,640

166
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,300
还有一件事

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,660
我只负责去拿录音
I'll get the recording.

168
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,000
我不会听里面有什么
I don't need to know what's on it.

169

感谢你的谨慎  一如既往

下午好  塔伯特先生

171
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,250
维尔塔宁真是好心  送来个美女
Nice of Virtanen to send a skirt.

172
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,390
我知道你手上有关乎我客户利益的东西
I understand that you have something of interest to my client.

173
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,940
知道么  就这么在虚空中搜索
You know, it is amazing what you can find

174
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,210
你就能发现令人意想不到的东西
just drifting out there in the ether.

175
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,690
对那些肉食者
One thing I have learned about

176
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,240
我最清楚的一点就是
The, uh, smartest guys in the room--

177
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,820
他们的裤腰带都很松
they just can't keep it in their pants.

178
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,060
你知道我为什么来
You know why I'm here.

179
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,700
你知道我的感受
You know how I feel.

180
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,540
我不能再隐瞒下去了
I can't hide it anymore.

181
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,830
这里有四万美金吗
This is all $40,000?

182
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,920
你数数
Count it.

183
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,300
回家去数
At home.

184
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,670
顺便  是我的话会要八万
By the way, I would have asked for $80,000.

185
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,430
说不定是什么风流艳事呢
Maybe it's a skirt thing.

186
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,950
塔伯特不过是个敲诈勒索的小流氓
Talbott's a blackmailing scumbag,

187
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,150
应该不是威胁
but hardly a threat.

188
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,650
她之前的活儿呢
What about her previous jobs?

189
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,650
公寓里没有客户名单
No client list in her apartment.

190
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,340
你得让她开口谈
You need to get her talking.

191
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,360
说的倒轻巧
Easier said than done.

192
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,590
沙利文警探
Detective Sullivan.

193
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,150
退休好多年了
Not for years now.

194
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,030
别人都叫我伯尼或老沙
Bernie or Sully. Dealer's choice.

195
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,920
我想和你谈谈73年
I, um, wanted to talk about that case you worked

196
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,560
你经手的那桩案子
Back in '73.

197
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,000
玛琳・以利亚
Marlene Elias.

198
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,650
这案子怎么又给提起来了
How did that mess come up again?

199
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,780
我正在调查的一个人几周前
A man I'm investigating broke into the evidence lockup

200
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,120
闯进了证物保管室
a few weeks ago.

201
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,180
他和同伙偷走了证物盒里的东西
He and his crew stole the contents of the evidence box.

202
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,480
你的笔录  凶器
Your notes, murder weapon,

203
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,280
8英寸的厨房刀
8 inch kitchen knife.

204
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,430
最后发现被捅进了
which turned out plunged into the chest

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
你当年嫌犯的胸口
of your lead suspect.

206
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,370
真是现世报啊
That would be divine retribution.

207
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,390
你能跟我谈谈德卢卡吗
What can you tell me about Deluca?

208
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,740
没问题
Piece of work.

209
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,840
我已经把他钉死在那个女人的谋杀案上了
I had him dead to rights on murdering that woman.

210
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,300
那个白痴在刀上留下了部分指纹
The dimwit left a partial on the knife.

211
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,820
检察官放弃了这桩案子吗
The D.A. Dropped the case?

212
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
都是幕后交易
Bought and sold.

213
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,520
当时可不像现在
Back then, the city was different.

214
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,530
玛琳是个鸡尾酒女侍
Marlene was a cocktail waitress.

215
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,150
她在吉亚尼・莫雷蒂的夜总会里工作

216
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,110
她和老头子有一腿
She has an affair with the don.

217
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,000
她想让他抛弃妻子
She wants him to dump his wife.

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,810
他受够了她的抱怨  就派这位胸口挨了刀的

219
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,460
去让她闭嘴
the cutlery rack, to shut her up.

220
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,970
他让她闭嘴了
He did.

221
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,450
永远闭嘴了
Permanently.

222
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,680
让我不能释怀的是那个孩子
The thing that stuck with me was the kid.

223
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,380
孩子  什么孩子
Kid? What kid?

224
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,800
我查到了这些
I dug these up.

225
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,370
玛琳和老头子有个孩子
Marlene and the don had a kid.

一个儿子

227

事情发生时他在外面玩
He was out back playing when it happened.

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,410
跑进来发现了他妈妈
Came inside and he found her.

229
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,100
孩子一路走到了警察局
Kid walked all the way to the station.

230
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,530
我还记得他没穿鞋子站在那里的样子
I still got that image of him standing there with no shoes on.

231
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,650
他后来怎样了
What happened to him?

232
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,960
老头子不想这段私情曝光
Well, he didn't want to cop to the affair,

233
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
孩子被送进了社保机构
So the kid went into the system.

234
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,840
这样的孩子的下场你也清楚
I don't have to tell you what happens to those kids.

235
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,320
你认为他是凶手吗
You think he's the killer?

236
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,190
还有谁会费这么大的劲
Don't know who else would go to so much trouble.

237
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,380
什么曲子
What is that?

238
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,970
只是些老歌
Ah, just some old bootlegs.

239
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,210
你喜欢爵士乐吗
You like jazz?

240

你喜欢吗
You do?

241
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,740
当然了

242
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,030
一直都很喜欢迈尔斯・戴维斯对爵士乐的评论
Always loved what Miles Davis said about jazz.

243
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,510
不要玩陈词滥调  要玩新鲜曲调
"Don't play what's there. Play what's not there."

244
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,530
是吗
Really?

245
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,710
你似乎很懂得玩弄别人
You seem to know how to play people.

246
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,630
我不是玩弄别人  我是帮人解决问题
I don't play people. I fix their problems.

247
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,890
回答你之前的问题  我讨厌爵士乐
And to answer your question, no, I hate jazz.

248
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,310
你该和一个人还是两个人见面
We're you supposed to be meeting with two people or one?

249
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,510
这有关系吗
What does it matter?

250
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,920
让我来解决这件事  佐伊
Let me take care of this, Zoe.

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,230

回车里去
Get back in the car.

253
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,550
你可没告诉我会有这么多人
You didn't tell me it was a party.

254
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,650
塔伯特把东西交出来了  没问题
Talbott handed it over. No problems.

255
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,430
你听过这个了吗
Did you listen to this?

256
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,330
你花钱可不是让我来听
You didn't hire me to listen.

257
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,160
劳森先生想要亲自谢谢你
Mr. Lawson would like to personally thank you.

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,600
不  我们坚持要你来一趟
No, we insist.

260
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,030
沃尔特  抓住那个司机
Walter, get the driver.

261
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,240
趴下
Get down.

262
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,890
看来雇你当司机实在是屈才啊
Guess I'm paying you to do more than drive.

263
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,010
里瑟先生  你没事吧
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

264
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,480
没事  这次交易有埋伏
Yeah, the hand-off was an ambush.

道格拉斯想要杀了我们俩

多谢提醒  我刚才也在  记得吗

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,290
她安全吗  里瑟先生
Is she safe, Mr. Reese?

268
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,950
暂时安全  就是有点受惊
For now. A little shaken up.

269
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,980
你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

270
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,400
他们不惜为那段录音而杀人
They're willing to kill for that recording.

271
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,500
我们得弄清上面有什么
We need to find out what's on it.

272

把塔伯特的地址发给我
Send me Talbott's address.

273

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,820
我们可以说是同行

谁给你的消息
Who gave it to you?

279
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,880
你有你的人  我有我的人
You have your people. I have mine.

280
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,850
你得找到卖给你录音的那个记者

286

不清楚  听不出来
No idea. Can barely make it out.

287
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,690
呆在这儿
Stay here.

他们在追杀所有接触过那段录音的人

309
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,210
维尔塔宁不仅仅是一家制药公司
Virtanen is more than just a pharmaceutical company.

310
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,560
我们的产品有助于患者  能治愈疾病
We create products that help and heal.

311
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,100
维尔塔宁是个大家庭
Virtanen is a family.

312
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,230
我期待了很多年  希望能成为其中一员
One I hope to be a part of for many years to come.

313
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,610
戴娜・米勒  劳森的情妇
Dana Miller, Lawson's mistress,

314
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,170
这是一场办公室恋情
Was an office romance.

315
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,730
干得好  芬奇
Nice work, Finch.

316
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,250
先别急着称赞我
I wouldn't be so quick to congratulate me.

317
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,300
我不是第一次听到戴娜・米勒这个名字
It's not the first time I've heard Dana Miller's name.

318
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,780
半年前
Six months ago,

319
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,790
机器曾给出她的号码
the machine gave me her number.

320
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,680
那时我还没找到你
I had yet to track you down,

321
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,200
所以没法帮她
so I wasn't in a position to help her.

322
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,410
报上说她死于脑动脉瘤
Newspaper said she died of a brain aneurysm.

323
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,930
才27岁  而且你知道
She was 27, and as you know,

324
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,910
机器不会报警意外事故
the machine doesn't see accidents.

325
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,280
这么说她是想把他俩的私情事公之于众
So she wanted to go public with the affair,

326
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,110
所以劳森找人杀了她
and Lawson had her killed for it.

327
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,060
为什么不花钱收买她  芬奇
Why not pay her off, Finch?

328
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,450
劳森是维尔塔宁帝国的继承人
Lawson is heir to the entire Virtanen empire.

329
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,440
要是被罗伯特・凯勒发现他的私情  劳森将一无所有
If Robert Keller ever found out, Lawson would lose everything.

330
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,250
既然是在制药企业工作
It wouldn't be hard for someone working at a pharmaceutical company

331
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,260
把谋杀假造成自然死亡绝非难事
to make murder look like natural causes.

332
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,410
我没想到还能查清她的事情
I never thought I'd know the truth about what happened to her.

333
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,970
而现在我还知道幕后黑手是谁
Now I also know the men responsible.

334
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,470
我们可以阻止他们对下个目标动手
We can stop them from ever giving us another number.

335
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,140
行动吧  去找摩根女士
Get out there, and find Ms. Morgan.

336
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,600
只要我们还不清楚她的行踪
Every moment we don't have her

337
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,660
都会被道格拉斯有机可趁
is a moment that Douglas can get to her.

338
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,150
那你又干嘛去
Well, what are you going to do?

339
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,520
我有个重要的商务会谈
I have an important business meeting.

340
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
是我近期的一个投资
Recent investment of mine.

341
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,610
和股东的会见安排好了
We cleared my schedule for a meeting with a shareholder.

342
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,520
这人可不是一般的股东
Guy isn't just a shareholder.

343
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,860
他两天前购进了8700万股
Bought 87 million shares in the last 48 hours.

344
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,420
现在持有维尔塔宁8%的股份
He now owns 8% of Virtanen stock.

345
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,760
我没听过这人啊
Never heard of this guy.

346
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
没人听过
No one has.

347
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,700
可能是企图收购的"稻草买家"
May be a straw buyer for a takeover.

348
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,810
恶意收购
Hostile bid.

349
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,810
不过...尽量示好吧
But, uh-- kid gloves.

350
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,230
我们也许该让老家伙亲自过来迎接
And we may want to wheel the old man in here

351
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,940
以示亲近
for a minute to press the flesh.

352
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,370
先生  这边请
Right this way, sir.

353
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,720
帕特杰先生
Mr. Partridge.

354
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,440
我是马克・劳森  很高兴见到你  先生
Mark Lawson. Pleasure to meet you, sir.

355
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,800
这么急把你请过来  真是不好意思
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice.

356
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,850
像您这样持有这么多股份的股东
I thought I knew everyone with an investment portfolio

357
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,150
我以为我该都认识
as broad as yours.

358
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,430
当别人都在觊觎你的钞票时
When you're in a position where people want your money,

359
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,350
低调可比收益更重要
a little anonymity is rather rewarding.

360
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,430
我从日本回来后
From my time in Japan,

361
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,140
学会了不该空手和人谈生意
I've learned never to go to a business meeting empty-handed.

362
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,010
您太客气了
That is-- you're too generous.

363
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,220
谢谢
Thank you.

364
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,710
想参观一下公司吗
You care for a tour of our facilities?

365
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,100
请吧
This way.

366
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
我们的产业重心是
What we like to focus on

367
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,650
百姓真正所需的药品...
is what people really need--

368
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,990
止痛剂
pain relief.

369
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,010
我就离不开那玩意
I can certainly relate to that.

370
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,360
我们去年的市场份额已达20%
We reached a 20% market share last year.

371
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,070
随着以赛洛特为主打的新药推出
And that's only going to rise with the launch

372
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,460
市场份额只会继续飙升
of our new product line, anchored by Sylocet.

373
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,200
赛洛特
Sylocet?

374
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,770
治疗偏头疼的新药
New migraine drug.

375
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,960
全新科技
Revolutionary.

376
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,820
刚获得药监局的批准
Just approved by the FDA.

377
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,160
帕特杰先生
Mr. Partridge.

378
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,900
我是罗伯特・凯勒
Robert Keller.

379
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,710
先生  您可是创建了一个雄伟的帝国
This is an impressive empire you've built here, sir.

380
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,620
现在由马克掌管了
Oh, it's Mark's empire now.

381
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,910
明年春季我正式退休
Retirement isn't officially till next spring,

382
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,800
不过重大决策都是他说了算
but he makes all the big decisions.

383
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,470
别告诉别人
Don't tell anyone.

384
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,170
我可不想失去乡村俱乐部的位子
I'd hate to lose my table at the country club.

385
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,380
帕特杰先生  恕我失陪
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Partridge.

386
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,490
马克的工作能力惊人
Mark has done an incredible job.

387
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,900
不光使公司财务运作得井井有条
Not only in keeping our finances in order,

388
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,980
还负责大量的
but overseeing a good amount

389
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,360
药品研发
of product research.

390
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
凯勒先生  我对这里很满意
Mr. Keller, I like what I see here.

391
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,490
我相信自己的钱投对了地方
I'm confident my money is in good hands.

392
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,990
见到你太高兴了
Lovely meeting you.

393
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,930
不好意思
Excuse me.

394
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,790
我得接个电话
I have to take this.

395
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,340
U盘收回来了
Flash drive's recovered.

396
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,240
塔伯特已经搞定
Talbott won't be a problem again.

397
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,110
干得不错
Great work.

398
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,110
不过还有点小麻烦
But just one loose end.

399
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,370
佐伊・摩根
Zoe Morgan.

400
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,700
有个保镖扮作她的司机
She had a bodyguard posing as a driver.

401
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,250
我们没有料到这种情况
It was an unforeseen circumstance.

402
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,120
并可不是小麻烦
It's not a loose end.

403
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
而是大问题
It's the whole damn thing falling apart.

404
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,180
我会搞定她
I'll handle her.

405
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,490
还有那个司机
and the driver, too.

406
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,950
决不能让这事牵扯到我们头上
Nothing can connect us to this thing.

407
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,890
卡特
Carter.

408
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,330
我是老沙
It's Sully.

409
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,630
我查到了一些小卡尔・以利亚的信息
I managed to fill in some of the blanks on young Carl Elias.

410
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,420
很好
Good work.

411
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,500
先别急
No, not so good.

412
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,980
那孩子就像个职业逃犯
The kid was like a professional runaway.

413
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,080
从八岁开始
From the age of eight,

414
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,040
从不在同一地方待超过几个月
he couldn't stay anywhere more than a couple of months.

415
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,600
这么说没人认识他
So no one really knew him.

416
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,950
除了一个叫格劳丽娅・雷辛托的老江湖
Nobody except some tough old bird named Gloria Recinto.

417
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,820
显然  她照顾过那孩子
Apparently, she, uh, she looked after him.

418
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,180
他也每年给她寄圣诞卡
He would send her a Christmas card

419
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,260
还寄点钱
and some money every year.

420
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,820
卡特  你得看看这些
You gotta read these things, Carter.

421
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,890
我是说  这小子看起来
I mean it's as if the guy

422
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,530
不是想当总统就是想做匈奴王
was going to either be president or Attila the Hun.

423
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,570
要我把他带过来吗
You want me to bring him in?

424
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,220
我亲自过去接他吧
I'll swing by, and pick him up.

425
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,240
那我得为你倒腾下自己了
Well, I'm going to make myself beautiful for you.

426
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,760
你好好倒腾吧  老沙
Good luck with that, Sully.

427
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,800
你知道我为什么来  你知道我的感受
You know why I'm here. You know how I feel.

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,200
我还是找不到佐伊
I still can't find zoe.

429
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,900
我再也隐瞒不下去了
I can't hide it anymore.

430
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,370
要是我都找不到她  道格拉斯大概也找不到
If I can't track her down, Douglas probably can't either.

431
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,110
我把这录音降降噪
Trying to clean up this recording.

432
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,740
抹掉空白处的杂音
Fill in the blanks.

433
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,710
我猜是戴娜是在劳森的办公室录的  你听
I think Dana recorded this in Lawson's office, listen.

434
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,080
我们做的事是不对的
What we're doing is wrong.

435
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,350
这么说
So?

436
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,950
她用手机录下了俩人的对话
She recorded the conversation on her cell phone.

437
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,020
想敲诈他吗
To blackmail him?

438
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,520
不  我看不是
No, I don't think so.

439
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,090
这是他办公室里饮水器的声音
Here's the fountain in his office.

440
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,460
通过我装的窃听器
Using the bug I planted,

441
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,550
我能获取房间的背噪
I was able to get room tone,

442
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,600
再从原始音频中把背噪去除
then I can strip it back out of the original recording.

443
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,240
听  现在清楚多了
Listen. This is much clearer.

444
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,300
我再也隐瞒不下去了
I can't hide it anymore.

445
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,210
我们做的事是不对的
What we're doing is wrong.

446
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,840
我要说出去
I want to tell someone.

447
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,880
我们这个新药的事  晚上搅的我睡不着觉
Keeps me up at night, knowing what our drug has done.

448
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,680
你可得好好想想清楚...
You need to think very carefully...

449
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,050
我们这个新药的事  晚上搅的我睡不着觉
"Keeps me up at night, knowing what our drug has done"

450
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,050
我还得把最后一段录音调清楚
I still have to clean up the last part of the recording,

451
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,150
不过就目前的信息来看
but there's enough here that you can tell

452
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,460
戴娜不是和劳森有私情
that Dana was not having an affair with Lawson.

453
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,530
她是威胁要举报他
She was threatening to blow the whistle on him.

454
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,870
在我们...
You know, before we--

455
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,540
在我...找到你之前
before I found you,

456
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,100
那些号码一直在我脑海挥之不去
the numbers haunted me.

457
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,480
我从没有过这么无助的感觉
I never felt so helpless in my entire life.

458
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,420
我也知道没法还每个人一个公道
And I know I can't get justice for all of them,

459
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,920
可哪怕只是一个...
but the possibility of having just one...

460
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
看来摩根女士还是决定出现了
Looks like our Ms. Morgan has decided to be found after all.

461
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,200
这次找到她后
This time, when you find her,

462
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,740
可别再跟丢了
try not to lose her.

463
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,320
你的确在追踪我的手机信号
So you are tracking my cell phone.

464
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,090
我了解这座城市的每个角落
I know how all the pieces of the city fit together.

465
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,230
三教九流
I know all the players.

466
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,530
所有门道我都知道
I know all the angles.

467
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,900
可现在你出现了
And then there's you.

468
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,940
我不明白你
Now I don't understand you.

469
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,470
我不喜欢我不明白的东西
And I don't like things that I don't understand.

470
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,280
那你干嘛还叫我过来
Then why did you want me to come here?

471
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,110
因为我不用非得喜欢你
because I don't have to like you

472
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,210
才能从你身上套消息
To get some news out of you.

473
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,020
录音里的那个姑娘
The girl on the recording.

474
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
她的名字叫戴娜・米勒
Her name was Dana Miller.

475
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,490
劳森杀了她
Lawson had her killed.

476
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,760
但不是因为他在睡她
Maybe not because she was sleeping with him.

477
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,190
我知道
I know.

478
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,760
她在维尔塔宁公司工作
She worked at Virtanen.

479
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,730
她本来是要出来公布
She was going to come out in public--

480
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,230
一桩涉及他们一种药品的丑闻
A scandal involving one of their drugs.

481
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,730
不错嘛
Not bad,

482
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,500
但这还不是全部
But it's not the whole story.

483
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,270
她参与了临床工作
She worked in clinical trials.

484
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,740
她被害五天前  她被调走了
Five days before she was killed, she was transferred out.

485
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,180
终止了权限
Access suspended.

486
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,880
你怎么知道这些事情
How did you come by that?

487
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,050
你有你的人  我有我的人
You have your people. I have mine.

488
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,550
我猜猜
Let me guess.

489
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,880
你想要跟维尔塔宁公司做笔交易
You're looking to strike a deal with Virtanen.

490
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,720
这回不是
No, not this time.

491
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,240
我以为每个人都会有所图谋
I thought everyone had an angle.

492
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,960
我曾经认识这么个女的
I knew this girl once.

493
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
很天真
Naive.

494
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,930
她为了学会这个世界的法则交了很重的学费
She got a tough lesson on the way the world works.

495
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,880
让我想起戴娜
That reminds me of Dana.

496
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,170
还有  他们想要杀了你
Also, they tried to kill you.

497
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,140
这个嘛也是有的
Well, there's that, too.

498
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,280
你想不想出去
You want to get out of here?

499
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,450
我们去哪
Where are we going?

500
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,520
干些违法勾当
To do something illegal.

501
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,250
吉尔默警司
Lieutenant Gilmore.

502
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,210
你不穿漂亮警服来我几乎都认不出你了
Almost didn't recognize you without that cute uniform.

503
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,480
这次你又想要什么
What do you want now?

504
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,650
今晚维尔塔宁制药公司会有
There's going to be a break-in

505
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,380
一次入室行窃
At Virtanen Pharmaceuticals tonight.

506
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,640
我要你保证警方不介入
I need you to make sure that the police don't respond.

507
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,330
此后我们两清
After this, we're done.

508
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,830
好了  芬奇  我们的摄像头就位
All right, Finch, our cameras are in place.

509
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,540
我有全方位视角  继续
I have full coverage. Proceed.

510
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,330
拿着这个
Hold this.

511
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,580
就是说这些人想杀了你
So these people are trying to kill you,

512
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,080
而你的计划是闯进他们的办公室
And your plan is to break into their office.

513
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,080
我比较喜欢单刀直入
I prefer the direct approach.

514
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,790
这里是南面出口  另一边有没有警卫
This is the south entry. Any guards on the other side?

515
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,790
一楼有两个  楼梯上没有
Two guards on the first floor, none on the stairwell.

516
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,360
继续  很好
Go ahead. - good.

517
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,800
进去了
Going in.

518
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,000
我有没有机会见见你这位空气朋友
Am I ever going to meet this imaginary friend of yours?

519
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,370
他非常注重隐私
He's a very private person.

520
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,370
慢  三楼上有个警卫
Wait, there's a guard on the third floor stairs.

521
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,440
朝你那边过去了
He's coming your way.

522
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,650
安全了  走
You're clear. Go.

523
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,730
你大概就是那种
You're probably one of those guys

524
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,360
拿着个回形针走遍天下都不怕的家伙
That can get out of anything with a paper clip.

525
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,100
你从哪学的这手艺
Where did you learn this skill?

526
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,690
说来话可长
It's a long story.

527
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,870
仍旧安全  里瑟先生
Still clear, Mr. Reese.

528
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,240
他们几个月前就删除了戴娜的邮件和上网记录
They deleted Dana Miller's email and browser history months ago.

529
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,350
没什么能被彻底删除  里瑟先生
Nothing is ever really deleted, Mr. Reese.

530
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,750
总有蛛丝马迹可循
The pieces are always out there.

531
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,560
你只要知道怎样把碎片给拼回来
You just got to know how to put them back together.

532
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
用回复软件就成
Use the recovery software.

533
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,790
好了
All right.

534
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,980
就这
Right there.

535
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,710
她浏览了这个文件十几次
She accessed this file a dozen times

536
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,620
就在她遇害前几天
In the days before she was killed.

537
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,380
看来是一种新药赛洛特的临床记录
Looks like a clinical trial for the new drug Sylocet.

538
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,100
药监局认证了的
FDA approved.

539
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,330
但它被篡改过
But it's been altered.

540
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,610
有两个重名的文件
These are two files with the same name,

541
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,700
只是老文件更大些
But the older one is slightly larger.

542
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,370
临床记录上少了六个名字
Six names are missing from the trail data

543
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,470
维尔塔宁报给药监局的是新版本
That Virtanen submitted to the FDA.

544
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,310
我要那些名字  里瑟先生
I need those names, mr. Reese.

545
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,390
来了
Here it comes.

546
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,890
他们都死了
They're all dead, Mr. Reese.

547
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,330
死了
Dead?

548
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,800
名单上所有人都死于心力衰竭
Every person on that list died of heart failure

549
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,900
都在服药一年后出事
Within a year of taking the drug.

550
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,200
劳森肯定把他们从研究数据中抹掉了
Lawson must've dropped them from the study

551
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,370
然后砸钱给地方机构搞定
And paid the locals to hide it.

552
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,030
他们新研发的仙药是毒药
Their new wonder drug is a killer.

553
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,470
这是200中的6个  百分之三的死亡率
It's 6 people out of 200. That's a 3% mortality rate.

554
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,540
如果是一百万人服用该药物
If a million people take that drug,

555
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,810
死的会是三万
30,000 can die.

556
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,620
那是什么声音
Wait, was is that sound?

557
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,490
空调声  怎么
Air conditioning. Why?

558
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,190
我就是漏掉了这个
That's what I've been missing.

559
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,730
听好
Listen.

560
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,800
别说话  别动  我要清楚的录音
Don't talk, don't move. I need a clean recording.

561
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,570
绝赞
Perfect.

562
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,200
保持联系
I'll be in touch.

563
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,010
看来我们该叫警察
Guess we should call the cops, huh.

564
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,350
你不厚道  警司  
Bad move, Lieutenant.

565
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,550
我既然信不过你  只好准备送你上路了
If I can't trust you, I'll have to destroy you.

566
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,650
我倒是有直觉告诉我你肯定没戏
Something makes me think you won't get that chance.

567
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,990
此外  我履行了我的承诺
Besides, I held up my end.

568
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,830
你想要警察不作为
You wanted the cops not to respond?

569
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,360
这就是警方不作为
This is the cops not responding.

570
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,910
我们这个新药的事  晚上搅的我睡不着觉
Keeps me up at night, knowing what our drug has done.

571
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,510
你可得好好想想清楚...
You need to think very carefully...

572
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,810
你这是逼得我没得选
You're leaving me with no choice.

573
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,230
我要去告诉凯勒
I'm going to go to Keller.

574
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,640
里瑟  我好像给你找到了个好东西
Reese, I think I've found something.

575
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,480
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

576
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,630
我跟你说了我来搞定
I told you I'd handle it.

577
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,960
两个都在我手里
I've got them both.

578
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,760
我来了
I'm on my way.

579
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,370
你还没告诉我你名字
You never did tell me your name.

580
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,840
约翰
John.

581
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,710
我叫约翰
The name's John.

582
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,530
这么极品的名字
Of course it is.

583
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,880
那么  约翰
So, John...

584
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,950
你怎么知道我会有麻烦
How did you know I was going to be in trouble?

585
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,450
从你的从业选择可以得知
Given your choice of career,

586
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,690
明显不是能百分百进退自如
Doesn't seem like much of a stretch.

587
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,990
建议你跳槽转行
You might consider a new line of work.

588
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,890
你还真上脸了啊
You're one to judge.

589
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,500
再说  我的事你又知道多少
Besides, you don't know anything about me.

590
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,140
我知道你几乎所有的事情
I know almost everything about you.

591
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,070
我知道你从小长在扬克斯区一个不错的家庭
I know you grew up in a nice house in Yonkers.

592
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,980
我知道你爸爸是个市政官员
I know your dad was a city official

593
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,710
直到他被卷入了一宗腐败案子
Till he got snared in a corruption case.

594
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,980
我知道你跟你妈妈在皇后区的一栋小公寓里
I know you spent the rest of your childhood

595
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,650
挤着过完了童年
In a little apartment in queens with your mother.

596
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,830
至于我唯一不知道你的一件事情
About the only thing I don't know about you

597
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,160
是我不明白你怎么会挑上这种工作
Is why you started doing whatever it is you do.

598
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,670
我爸爸是个党员
My dad was a party man.

599
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,970
接受党派操作的政客
Machine politician.

600
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,180
依令行事
Did what he was told.

601
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,050
直到警察上门
Right up until the cops showed up,

602
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,920
给他上了手铐
Put the cuffs on him.

603
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,390
地方媒体在我家门前连蹲了好几个星期的点
The local press was camped out on our lawn. For weeks.

604
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,660
然后这个人出现了
Then this guy showed up,

605
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,830
党派过来处理这种
The guy that the party would send to deal with...

606
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,300
危机的人
Uncomfortable situations.

607
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,400
他说了两个字
He said two words.

608
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,510
那些记者呢
And those reporters?

609
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,810
听完了打包就走了
They packed up, and they left,

610
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,140
从此再也没来过
And they never came back.

611
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:07,980
然后我就意识到  我想当这样的人
And I realized, that's what I want to be.

612
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,150
知道怎么说话的人
The person who knows what to say,

613
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,560
而且总是有筹码在手的人
And always has something to trade.

614
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,220
那你现在准备拿什么交易
So what are you going to trade now?

615
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,040
是我  帕特杰先生
Yes, it's Mr. Partridge.

616
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,570
我想要跟凯勒先生谈谈  马上
I need to speak to Mr. Keller, immediately.

617
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,740
先生  很抱歉
I'm sorry, sir,

618
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,840
凯勒先生现在无法接听您的电话
But Mr. Keller is currently unavailable.

619
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,210
听着  给我把他叫过来听电话
Listen, put him on the phone right now.

620
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,480
事态紧急
It's extremely urgent.

621
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,060
关乎生死
A matter of life and death.

622
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,350
我们终于面对面了
So we're finally face-to-face.

623
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,790
马克  你这是在犯错
You're making a mistake, Mark.

624
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,190
我可不是被铐在椅子上的那个
I'm not the one handcuffed to a chair.

625
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,320
你看过赛洛特的报告了吗
So you saw the Sylocet report?

626
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
希望你不介意
Hope you don't mind.

627
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,090
为了确保万无一失  我把报告
I emailed a copy to a friend

628
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,230
拷贝了一份发给了我朋友
so I could read it more thoroughly.

629
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,700
好吧  那份报告在哪
Okay, so where is it now?

630
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,440
在我唯一信任的人手上
At the only person I trust.

631
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,540
要是我们有什么不测  他就会公布那份报告
And if anything happens to us, that report goes public.

632
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,140
所有人都会知道你们的新药会致命
Everyone will know your new drug kills.

633
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,070
你觉得凯勒发现后会怎么办
What do you think Keller will do to you when he finds out?

634
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,260
这么着吧
Tell you what.

635
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,950
既然佐伊这么喜欢谈判
Since Zoe loves negotiating so much,

636
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,550
那我就给你们一个选择
I'll offer you two a deal.

637
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,650
谁先妥协我饶谁不死
First one to give up that report gets to live.

638
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,860
我联系到凯勒先生了
I've reached mr. Keller.

639
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,990
他马上就能与您通话
He'll be with you in just a moment.

640
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,890
谢谢
Thank you.

641
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,530
你这是逼得我没的选
You're leaving me with no choice.

642
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,370
我要去告诉凯勒
I'm gonna go to Keller.

643
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,800
你要告诉老头子吗
You want to tell the old man?

644
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,940
随便你
Here's your chance.

645
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,340
你以为我自己公司发生的事
You think anything happens in my company

646
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,140
我会不知道吗  小姑娘
Without me knowing it, young lady?

647
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,680
你觉得我是有多蠢
How stupid do you think I am?

648
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,710
帕特杰先生
Mr. Partridge?

649
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,950
凯勒先生在线上了
You're on with mr. Keller.

650
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,430
马克  他们怎么还没死
Mark, why aren't they dead yet?

651
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,660
她说她还有份报告拷贝
She says she has a copy of the report.

652
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,160
我还以为这一次你终于能够
and just when I thought you could handle

653
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,370
独当一面了
Something truly important.

654
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,710
摩根女士  现实点吧
Ms. Morgan, be reasonable.

655
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,540
每种新药都有副作用
Every new drug has side effects.

656
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,750
所以我们会有免责声明
That's why we have disclaimers...

657
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,010
还有保险
And insurance.

658
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,590
你不适合做什么道德卫士
This moral crusade doesn't suit you.

659
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,090
我认识的佐伊・摩根很有头脑
The Zoe Morgan I know is reasonable.

660
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:33,430
知道怎么做才够聪明
Knows when to make a smart play.

661
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,730
我会把报告给你
I'll get you the report.

662
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,660
我会亲自带给你
I'll bring you right to it.

663
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,730
我也说了吧
Told you.

664
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,620
我总有筹码
Always have something to trade.

665
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,490
走吧
Let's go.

666
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,340
佐伊会这么做  你其实不用感到惊讶
You know, you really shouldn't be surprised by what Zoe did.

667
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,410
绝不要相信那个贱人
Never trusted that bitch.

668
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,080
她总是给自己找好退路
Always looking for an angle.

669
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,050
氯化钾
Potassium chloride?

670
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,420
政府用作死刑注射剂
Government uses it for lethal injections.

671
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,720
几分钟后心脏就停跳
Stops a heart in minutes.

672
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,690
很人道哈
Quite humanely, really.

673
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,390
你真走运
Lucky you.

674
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,430
我走运
Lucky me?

675
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,220
我这就来
I'm on my way, now.

676
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,820
在海军造船厂
The naval yard.

677
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,050
在监狱里不准用手机
Jail rules. No more phones.

678
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,360
真聪明
Clever girl.

679
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,560
芬奇
Finch.

680
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,430
你失踪了两小时啊
Been trying to get you for two hours.

681
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,760
凯勒也牵涉其中
Keller's involved.

682
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,070
他和劳森是一伙的
He and Lawson worked it together,

683
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,200
也包括谋杀戴娜
Up to, and including Dana's murder.

684
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,600
我知道  凯勒阴了我们  佐伊也是
I know. Keller blindsided us, and so did Zoe.

685
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,570
她要把测试数据的报告
She's about to hand over the copy

686
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,310
交给劳森
Of that trial data to Lawson.

687
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,610
你该更信任别人  里瑟先生
You should be more trusting, mr. Reese.

688
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,350
佐伊刚发给我她的目的地
Zoe just sent me her destination.

689
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,250
海军造船厂  耳熟吧
Naval yard. Sound familiar?

690
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,320
-我这就去  -好了吗  先生
- I'm on my way. - Ready, sir?

691
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,860
凯勒先生  抱歉  我迟到了
Mr. Keller. Sorry I'm late.

692
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,160
抱歉  我先吃了  帕特杰先生
Sorry I started without you, mr. Partridge,

693
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,300
但人到了我这年纪  光阴如金啊
But when you're as old as I am, you can't waste a minute.

694
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,470
你喝什么
What's your poison?

695
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,450
我们到这来干什么
What the hell are we doing here?

696
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,620
你想要报告吧
You want your report, right?

697
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,820
他就在那
He's right over there.

698
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,090
你是要我过去  还是你过拿
You want me to go get it or--or you?

699
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,600
不  我看还是算了  你知道我怎么想吗
No, I don't think so. You know what I think?

700
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,070
我觉得你没有把报告发给别人
I don't think you emailed that report to anybody at all.

701
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:37,140
其实报告一直都在这
In fact, I think it's been right here all along.

702
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,450
你加入我们的时机恰到好处  帕特杰先生
You picked a perfect time to join us, mr. Partridge.

703
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,120
我们的新药赛洛特一问世
Once sylocet goes on the market,

704
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,510
你就不用再投资其他公司了
You'll never have to invest in another company again.

705
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,760
如果是其他人  他们肯定会
If anybody else, you know, they would have sent

706
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,360
把报告发给警方或媒体
This report to the police or the press.

707
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,860
但你不会
But not you.

708
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,700
你就是想把底牌握在自己手上
No, you just couldn't resist holding onto one more card.

709
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
没错
Yup.

710
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,970
你确实发给了
So you did send it

711
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,470
这世上你最信任的人
To the one person in the world you could trust.

712
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,380
你自己
Yourself.

713
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,910
而现在你就带着进棺材吧
Now you're going to take it to the grave.

714
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,210
离开这
Get the hell out of here.

715
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,750
佐伊
Zoe!

716
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,960
头痛哈
Migraine, huh?

717
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
听说现在有新的头痛药
Heard they got a pill for that now.

718
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,000
你怎么才来
Took your time.

719
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,530
你又是怎么决定
And at what point did you know

720
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,200
要做正确的事
You were going to do the right thing?

721
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,870
给你回形针的前两秒才刚决定
About two seconds before I slipped you the paper clip.

722
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,280
不管怎样
Anyway...

723
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,610
如同之前谈的那样  董事会和我要知道
Pleasant as it is to talk, the board and I do need to know

724
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,250
你的意向如何
What your...intentions are,

725
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,150
现在你持有维尔塔宁8%的股份
Now that you own 8% of Virtanen.

726
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,850
里瑟
拿到了药监局的报告

727
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,160
事实上  我卖掉了维尔塔宁的股份
Actually, I've sold my shares in Virtanen.

728
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,970
我收到消息说  维尔塔宁的股价会暴跌
I had a tip that the price is about to take a nosedive.

729
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,230
什么消息
Tip? What tip?

730
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,270
高层管理者将会遭到
That senior management was about to have

731
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,410
很严重的法律指控
Some very serious legal problems.

732
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,410
事实上  我收回了我最初的投资
In fact, I took my initial investment,

733
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,880
我做空了你们公司...
And I shorted your company...

734
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,350
一半的股票
to the tune of 1/2 billion shares.

735
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,450
如果你要跟我斗
If you're betting against me,

736
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,390
那你是全然不知自己在和谁打交道
You clearly don't know who you're dealing with.

737
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,330
我当然知道自己在和什么人打交道
Oh, I know exactly what kind of man I'm dealing with.

738
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,830
我知道你为达目的不惜伤害别人
And I know you don't care who you hurt to get what you want.

739
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,260
我知道你只在乎钱
I know the only thing you do care about is money.

740
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,170
所以我要夺走你的钱
So that's what I'm going to take from you.

741
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,260
你所有的钱
Your money. All of it.

742
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,230
你说的没错  凯勒先生
You were right, mr. Keller.

743
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,350
多亏了你
Thanks to you,

744
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:58,050
我再也不用投资其他公司了
I never will have to invest in another company.

00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,510
老沙
Sully?

747
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,310
是我  卡...
It's me, Car--

748
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,700
不
Oh, no.

749

首席财务官  马克・劳森

00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,450

To answer charges of fraud, conspiracy, and murder.

754
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,590

00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,680
已经正式下架
Has officially been shelved.

756
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,660
维尔塔宁的竞争对手  毕彻制药...
Virtanen's competitor, Beecher pharmaceuticals...

757
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,290
能麻烦你关掉么
You mind turning that off, please?

758
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,530
看来毕彻制药得到了内部消息
Sounds like Beecher got an inside tip.

759
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,970
有人肯定大赚了一笔
Somebody must have had a big payday.

760
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,300
也没你想的那么多
Not as big as you think.

761
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,510
戴娜・米勒的家人因为同维尔塔宁的官司
Dana Miller's family got a healthy donation
