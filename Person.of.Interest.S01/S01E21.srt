1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,160
你正被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,180
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,040
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,910
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know, because I built it.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,060
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动  
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,380
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything...

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,320
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people,

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,560
像你一样的普通人
people like you,

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,280
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,610
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,740
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,690
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,980
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,930
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,280
但不管是被害人还是行凶者
But, victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,120
只要你的号码被列出来  
if your number's up,

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,190
我们就会找到你
we'll find you.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,290
当你找到你在这个世上的羁绊
When you find that one person who connects you to the world,

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,180
你就变了
you become someone different...

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,460
变得更好
Someone better.

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,610
而当她被人从你身边夺去
When that person is taken from you...

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,210
等我
Wait for me.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,360
那你又会变得怎样
What do you become then?

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,720
您没事吧  先生
Are you okay, mister?

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,620
您怎么了
What happened to you?

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,460
我大概是辞职了
I think I quit my job.

在纽约居然无人身处危险
No one in New York is in danger

39
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,240
无人策划害人
or planning to hurt someone?

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,480
就算有  也仅是在心中暗想
If they are, they're keeping it to themselves.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,540
总之  我认为你应该放假
Anyway, I think you've earned some time off.

我保证过会通知你调查的最新进展

82
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,860
解散的走私团伙
broken up a couple of months back.

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,190
团伙头领可能在中情局内部有人  
The leader was suspected of having CIA ties,

84
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,800
不过他在被起诉前跑了

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,580
我记得
I recall.

86
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,160
我们认为神秘男子替他干过活

99

我们认为是其中一个投资者

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,650
雇了那神秘男子干的
hired your guy to do the job.

101
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,110
他在现场留下了痕迹
And he made some mistakes.

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,370
新罗歇尔多半有人知道内幕
Now someone in New Rochelle has to know something

103
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,830

考虑一下吧
Think about it.

112
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,890
毕竟  因为你  我们才会注意到他
I mean, you're the reason we're onto this guy.

113
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,410
你理应分享抓获他的功劳

我也正好有事找你
I got something for you too.

120
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,470
你居然也会喝啤酒吃烤肉
Never pegged you as the cues-and-brews type.

121
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,330
所以我更要选这里了  警探

更易遭受攻击
we become vulnerable.

124
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,290
好吧
If you say so.

125
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,180

你在电话里说  有事找我

看样子你知道
I'll take that as a "yes."

或许这不是什么坏事

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,890
怎么说
How do you mean?

136
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,730
如果有任何证据会威胁到我们共同的朋友
If there was any evidence that threatened our mutual friend,

137
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,110
我确信你会比唐纳利先找到的
I'm confident that you would find it before Donnelly would.

138
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,040
你是在建议我干扰联邦调查吗
Are you suggesting I obstruct a federal investigation?

139
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,350
当然  如何处理那些证据完全是
Of course what you did with that evidence would be

140
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,740
你个人的决定
entirely your concern.

141
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,330

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,020
我是她的老朋友
I'm an old friend.

159
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,380
她可能不在这儿上班了
She might not work here anymore.

160
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,640
她总说想换个环境
She was always talking about moving away.

161
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,990
很抱歉告诉您这个消息
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

162
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,420
洁西卡死于一场车祸
Jessica died in a car accident.

163
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,410
就在两个月前
About two months ago.

164
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,790
她说她会等的
She said she would wait.

165
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,610
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

166
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,530
如果你想联系她的家人
I think I have her husband's number here,

167
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,890
我好像有她丈夫的电话
if you wanted to reach out.

168
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:17,930
对不起
Sorry.

169
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,360
她离开公寓了吗
Has she left the apartment?

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,860
还没
Not yet.

171
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,950
你干嘛对这个感兴趣啊   芬奇
Hey, what's your interest in this broad anyway, Finch?

172
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,270
不关你的事
It's not your concern.

173
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,610
盯紧目标就行了
Just keep an eye out.

174
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,140
凯伦・加纳
Karen Garner.

175
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,670
她因为身份盗窃及使用空头支票而被通缉
She's wanted for identity theft, passing bad checks.

176
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,670
通缉令从底特律发出
Warrant's out of Detroit.

177
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,530
这姑娘可是重罪犯
Your girl's a felon.

178
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,670
是的  我知道她违法的问题  警探
Yes, I'm aware of her apparent troubles with the law, detective.

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,710
但我更担心她会有危险
But I'm more concerned that she may be in danger.

180
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,580
为什么这么想
What makes you think that?

181
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,100
凯伦・加纳是个化名
Karen Garner is an alias.

182
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,370
这个名字只出现了三个月
It's only been around for three months.

183
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,290
她没有信用记录
She has no credit history,

184
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,360
只有需要工作才离开公寓
she only leaves the apartment to go to work

185
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,300
出门时总是不停回头察看
and she's constantly looking over her shoulder.

186
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,660
好像她在隐藏自己
Sounds like she's hiding out.

187
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,320
或者说在跑路  更贴切
Or on the run, more likely.

188
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,050
也许她想低调点  以便筹划什么事
Maybe she's laying low, trying to plan something.

189
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,520
是啊  说不定她是个犯罪高手呢
Yes, perhaps she's a master criminal.

190
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,530
但也许她只是一名受惊的女人
But maybe she's just a scared woman

191
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,940
努力躲开威胁她的人
trying to stay a step ahead of her abuser.

192
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,220
好吧
Yeah, right.

193
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,680
我还想问你点事情
Let me ask you something, though.

194
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,480
干嘛要我办这差  你家神奇小子呢
Why am I planted out here instead of wonder boy?

195
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,880
里瑟先生另有安排
Mr. Reese is otherwise engaged.

196
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,070
你绝对不准为此事联系他  警探
And you are not to contact him regarding this matter, detective.

197
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,210
我们俩自己处理这件事
You and I will handle this ourselves.

198
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,660
没有新信息

199
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,260
卡特警探  欢迎来到新罗歇尔
Detective Carter, welcome to New Rochelle.

200
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,350
很高兴你接受了我的邀请
Glad to see you took me up on my offer.

201
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,800
目前掌握的情况如下
Here's what we know.

202
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,760
阿恩特一直在反复折腾投资者的钱
Arndt was playing it fast and loose with his investors' money.

203
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,940
最终因地产投资失败和赌博恶习全输光了
He ended up losing it on bad land deals and a gambling habit.

204
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,370
由于还不起信用卡
When he exhausted his line of credit,

205
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,750
他不得不从臭名昭著的贷款人手里借钱
he was forced to take money from less reputable lenders.

206
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,040
高利贷
Loan sharks.

207
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,120
他的赛马经纪人交待了两个人
His bookie gave us the name of a couple local guys

208
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,340
是他介绍给阿恩特的  我们正在核实
he introduced Arndt to, and we're checking it out.

209
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,110
上面说他已婚
Says he was married.

210
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,090
"妻子已故"
"Wife deceased."

211
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,980
她怎么了
What happened to her?

212
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,120
车祸
In a car accident.

213
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,530
阿恩特失踪前两个月发生的事
Two months before Arndt went missing.

214
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,060
严重车祸
Bad one.

215
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,600
她死了  他侥幸逃生
She was killed, he nearly was.

216
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,910
不过至此  阿恩特还是彻底潦倒了
But anyway, by that point, Arndt was completely under water.

217
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,520
出院没多久  他就失踪了
Shortly after he left the hospital, he went missing.

218
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,860
他们找到尸体了吗
They find a body?

219
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,900
没有  但鉴于发现的血量
No, but given the amount of blood spilled,

220
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
阿恩特不太可能还活着
it's doubtful Arndt survived.

221
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,450
听上去不像那家伙的做事风格
Doesn't sound like my guy's MO.

222
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,060
他通常很会掩饰自己的痕迹
He usually covers his tracks.

223
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,450
所以我们认为这是他的第一份活
That's another reason we think it was his first job.

224
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,750
现场一团糟  很血腥
It was messy, violent.

225
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,190
可能他本以为小菜一碟
Probably figured it would be easy,

226
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,530
结果发现不得不徒手苦战
then found out he had a fight on his hands.

227
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,540
我们找到了其中一个放高利贷的
We located one of the loan sharks.

228
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,750
你和本地警探谈过了吗
Did you talk to the local detectives?

229
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,170
还没  我有他们的资料
No, I had their files sent over.

230
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,570
我想和他们谈谈
I'd like to speak with them.

231
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,460
好的没问题
Sure. Great.

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,690
一有发现就通知我
Let me know if you find out anything.

233
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,680
会的
Will do.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,980
有什么情况  警探
Anything yet, detective?

235
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,570
有  她在上班的路上
Yep. Our girl's on her way to work.

236
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,950
你说得没错
And you're right.

237
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,630
这女人是被吓得够呛
Someone's got this girl spooked.

238
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,800
我得跟踪她到什么时候
How long am I gonna have to tail her?

239
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,050
跟踪到我们找出她在躲谁
Long enough for me to identify who she's hiding from.

240
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,660
你有没有看到一个女的经过
Hey, did you see a woman come through here?

241
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,870
有  她问我借用后面的厕所来着
Yes, she asked to use the bathroom in the back.

242
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,380
警探
Detective?

243
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,870
等等
Hang on.

244
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,080
如果容我来猜测一下
So if I were to speculate as to the reason

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,610
你气喘吁吁的原因  警探  
for your labored breathing, detective--

246
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,520
我跟丢了
I lost her.

247
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,690
果然如此
That would be it.

248
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,440
接下来怎么办
What do you want me to do?

249
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,540
回去当你的警察吧
Go back to your day job.

250
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,110
剩下的我来接手
I'll handle it from here.

251
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,150
您需要什么吗
What can I get you?

252
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,210
我来打听点事情
Just some information.

253
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,420
我昨晚来过
I was in here last night and

254
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,360
好像看到我邻居在这儿工作
I thought I saw my neighbor working here--

255
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,900
-凯伦・加纳  -没错  是她
- Karen Garner? - Yeah, that's right.

256
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,430
我路过这里  
I was passing by again,

257
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,120
看看能不能碰到她
I thought I'd see if I could catch her.

258
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,230
她一般都在  不过今天请假了
Normally you would but she called out today.

259
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,200
那我下次再来吧
Another time then.

260
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,010
肯定能遇着
I'm sure I'll see her around.

261
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,940
打扰一下
Excuse me.

262
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,240
我无意中听到了你在酒吧说的话
I couldn't help overhear your conversation at the bar.

263
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,590
你是凯伦・加纳的朋友吗
You're friends with Karen Garner?

264
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,230
只是点头之交
Well, more of an acquaintance, actually.

265
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,660
我叫布拉德・詹宁斯  联邦法警
Brad Jennings, US Marshals Service.

266
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,790
凯伦有什么麻烦吗  警官
Is Karen in some kind of trouble, Deputy?

267
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,300
凯伦・加纳  又名
Karen Garner, also known as

268
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,650
萨拉・阿特金斯  是名通缉犯
Sarah Atkins, is a wanted fugitive.

269
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,600
我正在找她
I'm trying to locate her.

270
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,180
不好意思  我不知道怎么帮你
Sorry, I don't know how I could help you.

271
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,380
我听你说  你跟她是邻居
Well, I thought I heard you say you were neighbors.

272
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,290
是的  没错
Yes, you did.

273
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,240
那请把你的住址告诉我  怎么称呼你
So maybe you could tell me where you live, Mr.--

274
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,350
不好意思  警官  我不想牵扯这事
I'm sorry, Deputy, I prefer not to get involved.

275
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,750
我没想牵扯到你
I'm not asking you to get involved.

276
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,880
把地址告诉我就好
I'm just trying to get your address.

277
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,660
如果你愿意也可以跟我去局里说
Now, if you prefer, we can do this down at the field office.

278
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,540
你好  哈罗德
Hello, Harold.

279
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,560
我是斯蒂尔斯警探  集团犯罪科
Detective Stills-- Organized Crime.

280
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,020
你问话的这人是我的线人
This guy you're talking to is my CI.

281
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,160
他是个秘密线人
He's a Confidential Informant?

282
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,570
还是已故黑帮头目莫雷蒂的洗钱人
And money launderer for the late Don Moretti.

283
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,950
我有话要问他
Hey, I've got some questions for him.

284
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,000
你的接近很可能会暴露他的身份
You were risking his cover by even approaching him.

285
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,890
我们走
Let's go.

286
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,680
他想干嘛
What did he want?

287
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,320
问我几个问题罢了
Just to ask me some questions.

288
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,610
真巧  我也有问题要问你  哈罗德
Funny, I've got a few of those for you too, Harold.

289
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,520
这么说你一直在跟踪我吗
So am I to assume that you were following me?

290
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,230
我想更重要的问题是
I think the bigger question is...

291
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,960
你是抛下我在独自行动吗
are you working a case without me?

292
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,320
我恐怕这案子对你来说  会有些敏感
I feared that, with this case, you had certain sensitivities.

293
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,060
因此最好别让你参与
I thought it best to let you sit it out.

294
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,130
有什么好敏感的
What kind of sensitivities?

295
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,080
她名叫  或者说她的假名叫
Her name-- or at least her aliases...

296
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,070
凯伦・加纳  以及萨拉・阿特金斯
are Karen Garner and Sarah Atkins.

297
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,840
她因为身份盗窃及使用空头支票
She has outstanding warrants for identity theft

298
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,690
遭到警方通缉
and passing bad checks,

299
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,030
不过我觉得她不是行凶者
but I don't think she's a potential perpetrator.

300
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,610
我认为她应该在躲避某人
I believe that she's on the run from someone.

301
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,540
躲避谁
Who?

302
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,350
很可能是她亲近的人
Likely someone she was close to.

303
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,260
我刚造出这台机器的时候
When I was first building the machine,

304
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,400
有些号码总是不停跳出来
I kept seeing the same numbers come up--

305
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,800
每隔一周  一个月或六个月
a week, a month, six months apart.

306
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,770
通常是女性
Usually women.

307
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,700
开始我以为是机器弄错了

凯伦・加纳  我们有你的拘捕令

463
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,800
嫌犯已被拘  在20轨处

464
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,040
什么事  警探
Yes, detective.

465
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,880
我在无线电上听到你们追踪的女人被捕了
I just heard on the radio your girl got popped.

466
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,470
就在火车站
Down at the train station.

467
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,630
他们已经通知法警了
They picked her up on a Marshal's BOLO.

468
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,400
她现在在哪里

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,540
可能还在那里

470

得赶快赶到车站去
Have to get to the train station.

473
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,770
我们来晚了  詹宁斯已经接走她了
We're too late. Jennings already picked her up.

474
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,760
他的丑行已曝露
With his cover blown,

475
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,810
不能通过官方途径带她回家
he can't take her home through official channels.

476
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,230
他会让她消失  芬奇
He's gonna make her disappear, Finch.

477
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,070
我们得找到她
We need to get to her.

478
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,390
我有办法了
I may have a way.

479
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,690
政府车辆现在都有

480
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,160
接入因特网的移动热点

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,230
比如这个
Like this one.

482
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,750
包括法警的车辆吗
That include Marshal vehicles?

483
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,270
是的
Yes.

484
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,100
所以我可以进入他们的网络
So I can get into their network.

485
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,540
根据行踪判断出哪辆车是詹宁斯的
The trick will be figuring out which vehicle is Jennings'.

486
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,540
是这辆
That's him.

487
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,820
西城高速公路
West Side highway.

488
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,190
他要带她出城

489
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,620
出去
Get out.

490
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,140
你说什么
Excuse me?

491
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,210
放下笔记本  哈罗德
Leave the laptop now, Harold.

492
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,590
然后出去
And get out.

493
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,690
您女儿真漂亮
Your daughter was so beautiful.

494
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,560
谢谢

495
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,750
你们俩亲近吗
Were you two close?

非常亲近
Very.

497
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,320
我们几乎每天都聊天
We spoke most every day.

498
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,370
你说想问几个关于彼得的问题
So you said you had some questions about Peter?

499
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,640
是的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

500
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,620
在他失踪前
Prior to his disappearance,

501
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,230
您是否发现您女婿有财务上的困难
were you aware of your son-in-law's financial difficulties?

502
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,700
没有
No.

503
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,720
彼得有份好工作
Peter had a good job.

504
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,130
颇能养家
He was a good provider.

505
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,370
据我们了解
Based on our information,

506
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,160
他的各项负债总额超过三百万美元
he owed more than $3 million to various entities.

507
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,680
洁西卡提到过
Jessica once mentioned

508
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,970
他们遇到了困难
that they were going through a rough patch.

509
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,620
但是彼得正在力挽乾坤
But that Peter was turning things around.

510
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,380
那是在事故前夕
That was just before the accident.

511
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,430
失陪一下
Excuse me.

512
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,820
你说洁西卡告诉你
When you said Jessica told you

513
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,800
他们遇到了困难
"They were going through a rough patch,"

514
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,510
她说的是钱  还是她和彼得的感情
was she talking about money, or her and Peter?

515
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,210
不
No.

516
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,220
洁西卡和彼得婚姻很美满
Jessica and Peter had a good marriage.

517
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,820
他们是有些问题  任何夫妻都有  但是
I mean, they had problems, like any married couple

518
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,290
警探  出来一下好吗
Detective. See you a minute?

519
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,390
刚接到电话  那个西装男
I just got a call that a guy in a suit

520
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,200
在下城区分局袭击了四名法警
assaulted four deputy marshals in their downtown field office.

521
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,860
等等  你说什么
Wait. What?

522
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,590
是啊  我现在过去跟进情况
I know. I'm heading back down there to follow up.

523
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,550
你留在这里和那位母亲沟通好吗
Do you mind wrapping things up with the mother?

524
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,300
似乎没戏
It looks like a dead end.

525
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,060
没问题
Sure.

526
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,500
卡特警探
Detective Carter.

527
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,730
那四法警事件是怎么回事
What's this about an incident with four deputy Marshals?

528
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,060
情况在我掌握之中
I've got it under control.

529
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,790
你确定吗
Are you sure?

530
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,990
因为看起来可并非如此
'Cause it doesn't sound like it.

531
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,100
我确定  警探
Yes, detective.

532
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,290
你在新罗歇尔的调查怎么样了
So how is your New Rochelle investigation going?

533
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,510
唐纳利目前还没有发现
Donnelly hasn't found anything so far,

534
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,330
不过似乎我有
but I think I have.

535
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,970
我认为阿恩特杀了他的妻子并掩盖了罪行
Yeah, I think Arndt killed his wife and covered it up.

536
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,080
是你们喜欢介入的类型
The kind of thing you guys usually intervene in,

537
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,230
只不过这次你搭档来晚了
except this time your partner was too late.

538
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,420
还是不明白约翰和这件事有什么关系
Still don't understand John's connection to this.

539
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,570
你确定没什么需要告诉我的吗
Are you sure there isn't anything you can tell me?

540
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,470
我确定你自己会查清楚的  警探
I'm sure you'll make sense of it, detective.

541
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,090
你提到说
You were saying something

542
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,610
洁西卡和彼得之间有些问题
about problems between Jessica and Peter.

543
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,690
只是一些小争执
You know, just little spats.

544
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,500
不值一提
Not even worth mentioning.

545
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,650
其中有超过言语范围的争执吗
Do you know if these spats ever went beyond words?

546
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,100
我不知道你是什么意思
I'm not sure what you mean.

547
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,870
他们动过手吗
Did they become physical?

548
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,800
你在暗示什么
What is it you're suggesting?

549
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,590
没什么
Nothing.

550
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,630
只是些常规问题
Just some routine questions.

551
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,960
我得走了
I should get going.

552
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,230
很抱歉打扰您
I'm sorry for troubling you.

553
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,100
彼得是有缺点  但他爱洁西卡
Peter had his faults, but he loved Jessica.

554
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,210
洁西卡也爱他
And she loved him.

555
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,700
我相信她爱他  夫人
I'm sure she did, ma'am.

556
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,580
他远远好过她  之前的男友
He was so much better than her...usual type.

557
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,070
她在彼得之前有别的男友吗
She was seeing someone before Peter?

558
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,280
她和一名士兵有过一段
She had a fling with a soldier.

559
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,860
在她还住在塔克马的时候
Back when she was living in Tacoma.

560
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,830
那名士兵  你记得他的名字吗
This soldier--do you remember his name?

561
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,790
不记得
No.

562
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,620
他们在一起很长时间
They weren't together very long.

563
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,730
他总在执行公务  留下她一个人
He was always away on duty, and then she'd be alone.

564
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,070
她的生活不应该那样
That wasn't the life for her.

565
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,650
他跟她说了同样的话  让她别等他
He told her the same thing-- told her not to wait for him.

566
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,880
不过  我有时想  如果她等了他
However, sometimes I now wonder...if she had waited for him,

567
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,980
也许会更好  也许她现在会很快乐
maybe things could have worked out, maybe she would be happy.

568
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,730
我们现在还能聊天
And we'd talk again.

569
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,100
请问一下  你有那个人的照片吗
Can I ask, do you have any pictures of this man?

570
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,030
没有
I don't.

571
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,620
不过我有些洁西卡的遗物
But I still have some of Jessica's things.

572
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,030
你愿意的话可以看看
You're welcome to look through them if you like.

573
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,820
好的
Sure.

574
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,980
洁西卡
Jessica.

575
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,890
是的  我订婚了
Yeah. I got engaged.

576
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,970
他叫彼得
His name's Peter.

577
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,350
这是你在那边学到的东西
That's one of the things you learn over there.

578
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,760
到头来  我们都是一个人
In the end, we're all alone.

579
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,380
没有人会来救你
And no one's coming to save you.

580
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,460
祝你和彼得幸福
Be happy with Peter.

581
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,490
你不是真心的
You don't believe that?

582
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,820
让我等你  只要你说我就答应
Tell me to wait for you and...say those words and I will.

583
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,830
干杯
Cheers.

584
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,150
到头来  我们都是一个人
In the end, we're all alone.

585
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,320
没有人会来救你
And no one's coming to save you.

586
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,010
基恩
Gene?

587
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,120
我是乔丝・卡特

588
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,210
挺好
Good.

589
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,620
帮我个忙
Listen, I need a favor.

590
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,030
个人档案  名字是约翰
Personnel file-- first name John.

591
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,020
特种部队
Special Forces.

592
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,440
在01年六月至九月间
Stationed at Fort Lewis

593
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,390
驻扎在路易斯堡
between June and September of '01.

594
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,830
别让其他人看到
My eyes only.

595
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,610
好的  谢了  基恩
Yeah, thanks, Gene.

596
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,730
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese.

597
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,100
怎么了  芬奇
What is it, Finch?

598
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,950
你抓到詹宁斯警官后打算如何
What exactly is your plan once you catch up to Deputy Jennings?

599
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,310
把萨拉从他身边救走
To get Sarah away from him.

600
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,780
那詹宁斯呢
And Jennings?

601
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,700
我给过詹宁斯机会
Jennings had his chance.

602
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,200
他冥顽不灵
He didn't take it.

603
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,690
我认为此情况下
I think, under the circumstances,

604
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,560
明智的选择是让警察介入此事
it might be a good idea to bring the police in on this one.

605
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,610
芬奇  你雇我来解决这些事情
Finch, you hired me to take care of these things.

606
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,880
如果你不喜欢我的风格  雇别人去
You don't like how I do it, hire someone else.

607
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,890
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

608
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,750
约翰

609
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,580
-我是卡特  -你好  警探

610
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,160
新罗歇尔这件事

611
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,890
车祸  掩盖事故  洁西卡
The car accident, the cover up, Jessica.

612
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,910
你知道我会发现什么  对吗
You knew what I'd find, didn't you?

613
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,770
有时知道也不是件好事  警探
Knowing isn't always a blessing, detective.

614
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,700
确实
True.

615
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,470
但我承认我打电话是为更要紧的事  约翰
But, I confess, I was calling with a more urgent problem-- John.

616
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,310
别告诉我你又把他丢了
Don't tell me you've lost him again.

617
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,790
不  我知道他在哪  但我  无法联系他
No, I know where he is. I just... can't reach him.

618
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,300
无法阻止他
Or stop him.

619
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,260
我们来这儿干嘛  布拉德
Why are we here, Brad?

620
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,500
我想跟你好好聚聚  宝贝
I wanted us to have some time together, baby.

621
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,980
就你和我
Just you and me.

622
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,930
我不知道我们之间是怎么变成这样的
I don't know how things got so out of hand with us.

623
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,730
但我保证  我会处理好的
But, I promise, I'm going to fix it.

624
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,750
你不用再逃跑了
You don't have to run anymore.

625
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,510
你相信我  对吗
You believe me... right?

626
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,130
我相信
I do.

627
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,960
我当然相信你  我当然相信
I do believe you, I do believe--

628
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,670
那我们先把手铐摘了吧
So maybe we can take these off now?

629
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,630
你永远学不会说话  是吗
You never did know what to say, did you?

630
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,920
我知道你怎么想的
I know what you're thinking.

631
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,250
你认为都是我的错
That this is my fault.

632
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,220
好像我想这样似的
That, somehow, I wanted this.

633
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,750
但你想过这对我来说有多难吗
But have you ever considered how hard this has been for me?

634
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,830
为你我惹了多大的麻烦
The trouble I've gone through for you?

635
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,610
还要我再付出多少代价  萨拉
What's it gonna take, Sarah?

636
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,250
我非常爱你
I love you so much.

637
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,190
但我不能再继续下去了
But I can't do this anymore.

638
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,470
走
Go.

639
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,140
去哪
Where?

640
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,250
想去哪去哪
Anywhere you want.

641
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,920
你自由了
You're free.

642
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,900
谢谢
Thank you.

643
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,990
萨拉
Sarah.

644
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,490
她走了  结束了
She's gone. It's over.

645
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
有什么好笑的
Something funny?

646
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,310
你从没爱过  是吗
You've never been in love, have you?

647
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,030
真正的爱
Really, truly in love?

648
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,140
怎么说
Why?

649
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,420
爱过就会明白  它永远不会结束
Because then you'd know... It'll never be over.

650
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,350
你会结束
It is for you.

651
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,000
你朋友告诉我  或许能在这里找到你
Your friend told me I might find you up this way.

652
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,560
我不能让你带走他  约翰
I can't let you take him, John.

653
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,840
不能重复新罗歇尔的结局
This can't end like New Rochelle.

654
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,590
我需要查看一下后车箱吗
Do I need to look in the trunk?

655
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,220
想做什么随便你
You can do whatever you like.

656
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,090
我要做的事一定会做
It isn't gonna change what I have to do.

657
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,910
把他交给我  约翰
Let me have him, John.

658
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,660
如果我交了  他会脱身
If I do, he'll get away with it.

659
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,420
我保证他不能
I'll see that he doesn't.

660
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,620
那不是你能决定的
It won't be up to you.

661
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,330
这才是重点
That's my point.

662
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,610
有些事你能行  警探  但有些你无能为力
There are things you can do, detective, and things you can't.

663
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,760
所以才需要我的存在
And that's where I come in.

664
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,800
我不能任由你杀人
I can't allow you to just execute people.

665
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,280
这与你无关
This isn't on you.

666
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,040
是我的事
It's on me.

667
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,490
我只要求你相信我
All I'm asking for is your trust.

668
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,190
相信什么
What?

669
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,850
相信你会做正确之事吗
For you to do the right thing?

670
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,240
相信我会做应做之事
That I'll do what needs to be done.

671
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,630
沙利文派你来的吗
Sullivan send you?

672
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,930
这算是在  恐吓我吗
This supposed to be some kind of... intimidation?

673
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,500
我没有钱给他
I don't have his money.

674
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,810
你没有什么我想要的
You don't have anything I want.

675
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,030
已经没有了
Not anymore.

676
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,230
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

677
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,090
问得好
Good question.

678
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,350
我也很久没有答案了
Haven't known the answer for a long time.

679
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,270
我知道我曾是谁
I know who I was.

680
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,180
我曾是那个抛弃她的人
I was the guy who left her behind.

681
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,990
知道为什么吗
You know why?

682
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,990
知道真正的原因吗
The real reason?

683
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,890
因为我认为她值得拥有比我更好的人
Because I thought she deserved someone better than me.

684
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,520
我认为她值得拥有会照顾她
I thought she deserved someone who would look after her...

685
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,000
陪着她的人
be there for her.

686
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,030
我认为她值得拥有像你这样的人
I thought she deserved someone like you.

687
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,090
我不知道
So I don't know.

688
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,130
我还希望你告诉我呢
I was hoping you could tell me.

689
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,830
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

690
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,090
我现在该是谁
Who I'm supposed to be now.

691
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,000
她已经不在了
Now that she's gone.

692
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,630
知道吗
See...

693
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,230
当你找到你在这个世上的羁绊
when you find that one person who connects you to the world,

694
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,550
你就变了
You become someone different...

695
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,530
变得更好
Someone better.

696
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,840
而当她被人从你身边夺去
When that person is taken from you...

697
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,470
那你又会变成怎样
What do you become then?

698
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,840
我都开始琢磨
I was beginning to wonder

699
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,460
几时才能再收到你的信息了
when I was going to hear from you again.

700
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,670
我在城外有点事情要打理
I had some business to take care of, out of town.

701
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,600
相信你现在理解了
I trust you now fully appreciate

702
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,460
我为何不告诉你萨拉一事
why I couldn't tell you about Sarah's case.

703
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,040
希望你现在明白了
I hope you now understand

704
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,530
你为何应该告诉
why you should have.

705
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,070
你早知道了吗
Did you know?

706
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,500
她就是不停跳出来的号码之一吗
Was she one of those numbers that came up again and again?

707
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,070
我只知道  里瑟先生
What I know, Mr. Reese...

708
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,880
新罗歇尔之事
Is that New Rochelle happened

709
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,760
发生在我们共事之前
before we started working together.

710
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,650
正因如此
And because of that,

711
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,850
我们两人对此都是无能为力
there was nothing that either one of us could have done.

712
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,680
忘记把这个放进你的生日礼物里了
Forgot to include that in your birthday present.

713
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,430
肯定是一时疏忽

729
