1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,780
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,870
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,760
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,550
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because...I built it.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,990
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖行动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,020
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,610
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,030
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,940
而政府认为这些罪行是无关信息
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,550
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,840
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner.

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,390
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,990
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,570
你永远找不到我们
You'll never find us.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,870
不管是被害人还是行凶者  只要你的号码被列出来
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up,

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,820
我们就会找到你
we'll find you.

17

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,240
早上好  里瑟先生
Good morning, Mr. Reese.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,570
借你吉言
If you say so.

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,010
里面是croquillants吗
Any croquillants in there?

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,010
{\an8}法文甜点名

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,510
如果你是指甜甜圈  答案是有
If that's a doughnut, then yes.

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,170
有什么事儿
So what do we got?

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,970
不太走运  信息不多
Nothing much, unfortunately.

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,430
机器吐出了一个号码
The machine kicked out a number that has

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,580
这号码的网络痕迹少得前所未见
one of the smallest digital footprints I've never seen.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,270
没照片吗
No photos?

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,750
并不是每个纽约人都有驾照  里瑟先生
Not everyone in New York has a driver's license, Mr. Reese.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,350
社保号码前三位表明
First three digits of the social

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,480
乔丹・海丝特出生于乔治亚州
suggest that Jordan Hester was born in Georgia.

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,910
难道要我凭借口音认出他吗
I'm supposed to recognize him by his accent?

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,120
或者是她  我甚至都没法辩明性别
Or her. I can't even verify the gender.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,250
海丝特的生活远离因特网  网上没有照片
Hester's living off the grid-- no photos online

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,400
社交网站也难觅其踪
and nothing on the social networking sites.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,550
真不理解人们干嘛
Never understood why people

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,090
要把个人信息发到那些网站上
put all their information on those sites.

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,760
这可为我之前在中情局的工作大开方便之门
Used to make our job a lot easier in the CIA.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,900
这是自然  所以我才建了那些东西
Of course. That's why I created them.

39
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,250
你是说  是你发明了社交网站吗  芬奇
You're telling me you invented online social networking, Finch?

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,780
机器需要更多的信息
The machine needed more information.

41
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,020
人们的社交关系  他们之间的联系
People's social graph, their associations--

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,940
政府多年来一直在试图弄清楚这些
The government had been trying to figure it out for years.

43
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,670
结果大多数人都自愿贡献出来
Turns out most people were happy to volunteer it.

44
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,190
商家也籍此获得巨额利润
Business wound up being quite profitable too.

45
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,480
很不幸  乔丹・海丝特似乎
Unfortunately, Jordan Hester seems

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,240
比大多数人要谨慎
to be more cautious than most.

47
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,360
不过我还是能做个信用调查
But I was able to run a credit check.

48
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,570
结果显示  海丝特各方各面都有两个
According to this, Hester's got two of everything.

49
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,880
两个银行账户  两套公寓
Two bank accounts, two apartments,

50
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,100
-两份电话账单  -如果非要我猜
- two phone bills. - If I had to guess,

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,770
你也知道我很讨厌猜测
which, as you know, I hate doing,

52
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,420
我得说咱们要找的是个有着双重身份的人
I'd say we're looking at a person leading a double life.

53
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,970
一个人搞不定
Can't cover them both.

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,070
你该出去呼吸新鲜空气了
Time for you to get some fresh air.

55
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,080
我给卡特打电话
I'll call Carter,

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,520
看看咱们要找的人有没有犯罪记录
see if our guy--or girl-- has a criminal record.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,070
你确定这样好吗
Is that a good idea?

58
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,050
卡特警官现在可不太待见你
Detective Carter's not exactly your number one fan right now

59
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,570
瞧瞧  卡特警探
Lo and behold, Detective Carter

60
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,240
亲临现实中的凶案调查现场
at an actual homicide investigation.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,540
怎么  追那个神秘男人追烦了吗
What, are you tired of chasing around your mystery man?

62
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,120
有什么发现
What do we got?

63
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,850
男性非裔  17岁
African-American male, 17 years old.

64
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,140
送到医院前已死亡  多亏了这些天才们
DOA, thanks to this genius over here.

65
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,260
他们因为一个女孩起了争执
They got into an argument over a girl.

66
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,310
-杀人凶手  -但事实已经清楚了
- Murderer! - But this is open and closed.

67
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,200
-这孩子已经招认了  -他有说动机吗
- The kid already confessed. - Did he say why he did it?

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,360
他的原话是"我还能怎么办"
He said, and I quote, "What was I supposed to do?"

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
然后又说  这都是我们的错
And then he said it was our fault.

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
这话什么意思
Yeah, how does that follow?

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,460
怪我们没赶来阻止他
Said we weren't here to stop him.

72
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,530
等我一会儿
One second.

73
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,400
好的
Sure.

74
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,890
{\an8}未知号码

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,780
我试图阻止他
I tried to stop it.

76
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,470
可是无能为力
There was nothing I could do.

77
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,320
我在上城区的公寓里  里瑟先生
I'm at the apartment in the Village, Mr. Reese.

78
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,630
-你在布鲁克林的公寓吗  -是的
- Are you at the one in Brooklyn? - Yep.

79
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,970
有任何有关海丝特的线索吗
Any sign of Hester at your location?

80
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,030
要是知道我要找的是什么就好了
It would help if I knew what I was looking for.

81
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,940
您好
Hello.

82
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,660
谢谢  非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you so much.

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,000
谁后进入  中午请客
Last one in pays for lunch.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,870
我想吃印度菜
I'm in the mood for Indian.

85
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,710
卡特警官那边有回复吗
Any response from Detective Carter?

86
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,580
还是不接我电话
Still not answering my calls.

87
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,970
也许应该换你试试
Maybe you should try her.

88
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,390
卡特的意见不是针对你  里瑟先生
You know, Carter's issue isn't with you, Mr. Reese,

89
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,040
而是针对你的方法
It's with your methods...

90
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,620
我们的方法
Our methods.

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,410
更别提
Not to mention the fact

92
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,210
你供出了她负责保护的证人
that you gave up a witness under her protection

93
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,770
还差点害死一名警察
and nearly got a cop killed in the process.

94
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,830
-人孰无过嘛  芬奇  -波西米亚风格
- Nobody's perfect, Finch. - This is very bohemian.

95
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,900
也许海丝特是名艺术家或作家
Maybe Hester's an artist or writer.

96
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,880
但没有照片
No photos though.

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,000
你看到什么了
What are you seeing?

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,360
斯巴达风格
Well...It's very Spartan.

99
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,440
只有一张桌子  一个床垫
Just a desk, mattress,

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,250
一些健身器材  基本上就这些
Some free weights. Not much else.

101
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,950
也许那是海丝特的办公室
Maybe it's Hester's office.

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,870
在不同的公寓楼里吗
In a different apartment building?

103
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,030
发现一卷钱  上面标有海丝特首字母缩写
Found a money roll marked with Hester's initials.

104
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,640
但都是小面额
Mostly small bills though.

105
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,110
我在检查垃圾  发现了一些收据
Just going through his garbage. I got some receipts.

106
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,390
"锤与钉"
The Hammer And Nail.

107
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,610
这酒吧就在拐角那边
That pub is just around the corner from here.

108
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,740
收据显示享有员工折扣
Receipt shows an employee discount.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,560
这钱可能是小费
Money could be from a tip pool.

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,950
芬奇  我要去查查
Finch, I'm going to check it out.

111
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,740
如果他居住工作都在布鲁克林
If he lives and works in Brooklyn,

112
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,460
那这地方又是用来干嘛的
what's this place for?

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,370
-要点什么  -随便弄点现成的
- What can I get ya? - Whatever's on tap.

114
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,530
海丝特  怎么搞了这么久
Hester, what's taking you so long?

115
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,370
这些被压在一堆箱子下面
They were under a bunch of other boxes.

116
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,260
芬奇  我看到海丝特了
Finch, got eyes on Hester.

117
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,300
-他在酒吧做服务员  -服务员
- He's working as a barback. - Barback?

118
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,020
他怎么付得起两套房子的租金
How can he afford to keep up the rent on both places?

119
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,770
多谢您的帮助
Thanks for all the help.

120
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,990
没什么
Yeah, well--

121
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,620
今天可比昨天暖和多了
It's much warmer than yesterday.

122
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,460
是啊是啊  好了
I know, I know. Okay.

123
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,630
还有什么要帮忙的吗  海丝特小姐
So anything else I can do for you, Miss Hester?

124
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,750
没有了  我说最后一次  雷
No, and for the last time, Ray,

125
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,450
请叫我乔丹就好
Please call me Jordan.

126
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,330
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese...

127
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,870
你看到海丝特了  但我听到海丝特了
You have eyes on Hester, but I have ears on her.

128
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,240
-什么  -乔丹・海丝特
- What? - Jordan Hester.

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,260
现在正在她的公寓里
She's here in her apartment.

130
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,240
这根本就不是什么以双重身份生活的人
This isn't one person leading a double life.

131
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,810
是两个人以同一身份生活
It's two people living one.

132
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,010
欢迎回家
Welcome back.

133
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,890
我看我得感谢你
I suppose I should thank you

134
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,570
帮我疏散了那栋大厦
for making them evacuate the building.

135
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,370
要谢就谢自动喷水灭火系统
Thank the automatic sprinkler system.

136
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,060
我们还是不知道乔丹・海丝特是什么人
So we still have no idea who Jordan Hester is.

137
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,170
至少我们把范围缩小了
Well, at least we narrowed it down.

138
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,830
两个人共享一个社保号码
Two people, one social security number,

139
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,400
只有一个是真正的海丝特
only one can be Hester, 

140
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,970
另外一个肯定是冒牌货
so someone is an imposter.

141
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,960
祝你能够成功找出来
Good luck telling who's who.

142
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,260
咱们得赶紧弄清楚
We'd better decide quickly.

143
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,560
通常机器吐给我们一个号码后
Usually when the machine gives us a number,

144
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,420
只有24到48小时阻止事情发生
we have only 24 to 48 hours before something happens.

145
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,700
我们不是应该能找到
Shouldn't we be able to track down

146
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,290
他们其中某人的出生证明吗
a birth certificate for one of them?

147
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,670
很早之前的出生证明很难弄到
Long-form birth certificates are hard to get a hold of.

148
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,710
大多数20年以上的医疗记录
Most medical records over 20 years old

149
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,280
都没有被数字化
aren't digitized anywhere.

150
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,780
我们面对的不是一般的身份盗窃  对吧
We're not dealing with a typical identity thief here, are we

151
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,820
确实不是
No.

152
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,420
那种人通常会偷了你的钱
Normally they would steal your money

153
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,010
然后拿去挥霍
and go on a shopping spree.

154
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,610
这个偷的可是全部的生活
This one is stealing a whole life.

155
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,630
那女人的手提电脑里有发现吗
Did you get anything from the woman's laptop?

156
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,270
邮件和联系人表  没有任何迹象显示
Emails and contact list-- nothing that would indicate

157
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,550
她不是真正的乔丹・海丝特
that she's not the real Jordan Hester.

158
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,110
我侵入了那男人的电话
I blue-jacked our guy's phone,

159
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,420
检查了他的最近通话记录
went through his recent calls.

160
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,130
看来他上星期租了辆货车
Seems he rented a van la week.

161
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,090
也许他总算决定要去买点家具了
Maybe he's finally going to buy some furniture.

162
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,610
两个人都得盯着
We'll need to keep eyes on both of them

163
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,180
直到搞清楚为止
till we figure this out.

164
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,610
我们还是需要外援
We're still going to need an extra hand.

165
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,920
真正的乔丹・海丝特  请上前一步
Will the real Jordan Hester please stand up?

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,770
你好啊  莱奈尔
Hello, Lionel.

167
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,600
把莫雷蒂拱手让给了以利亚  有你的
Nice job handing Moretti over to Elias.

168
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,420
我别无选择
I had no choice.

169
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,770
你要HR的动静  不用担心了
Well, you got HR buzzing. Don't worry about it though.

170
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,330
我快查出幕后主脑们了
I'm pretty close to finding out who the major players are.

171
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,890
我叫你来不是问HR的事情
I didn't ask you here to talk about HR.

172
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,190
有任务给你
I've got an assignment for you.

173
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,840
我要你去查关于乔丹・海丝特的一切
I need you to dig up everything you can on a Jordan Hester.

174
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,100
你要我去HR卧底
You got me doing undercover work for HR.

175
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,500
现在又要我做"伟光正"的活儿
Now you want me to do above-the-board stuff too?

176
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,480
你到底要我怎么样
Make up your mind.

177
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,360
我的工作可不是包你轻松混日子  莱奈尔
I didn't realize it was my job To make yours easier, Lionel

178
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,370
一会儿好警察  一会儿坏警察
Hey, good cop, bad cop,

179
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,980
你在拿我的生活当儿戏耍
It's only my life we're playing with here.

180
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,770
我才不管你的生活呢  是吧
It's not your life I'm focused on right now, is it?

181
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,060
有人需要我们的帮助
Someone needs our help.

182
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,700
-哪一位  -就是要你查清这点
- Which one? - Exactly.

183
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,450
我尽力吧
I'll see what I can do.

184
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,270
芬奇  你跟的海丝特如何了
Hey, Finch, what's your Hester up to?

185
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,070
六个小时了  尽在跑腿儿了
Six hours and all she's done is run errands.

186
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,810
接下来好像要去邮局
Probably go to the post office next.

187
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,990
-我跟的这位海丝特还在工作  -这么说
- My Hester's still at work. - So we're dealing with

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,190
我们跟的是地球上最平凡的两个人了
the two most ordinary people on the planet.

189
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,230
偏偏其中一个名不符实
Except one of them is not what they seem.

190
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,240
我又研究了一下那份信用报告
I did some more digging on that credit report,

191
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,790
发现很有趣的一点
found something interesting.

192
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,500
上城西区的一处豪华公寓
A luxury co-op on the upper West Side

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,210
六个月前做了一份信用调查
ordered a credit check six months ago.

194
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,400
也许值得一看
Might be worth a look.

195
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,190
你不是说还有第三个乔丹・海丝特吧
You're not telling me there's a third Jordan Hester, are you

196
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,750
我想没有
I don't think so.

197
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,650
其中一位海丝特在那里租了一间大公寓
One of our Hesters rented a large apartment there.

198
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,130
但前台说他从没见过任何一位海丝特
But the man at the front desk says he's never met him or her

199
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,780
我跟的这海丝特还在上班呢
Well, my Hester's still in the middle of his shift.

200
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,330
我去查查
I'll check it out.

201
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,500
你没跟双尸命案吗
You pull a double homicide?

202
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,710
在帮一个朋友跟个案子
I'm just doing a favor for a friend over at vice.

203
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,280
你以前办过身份盗窃案吗
Did you ever work an identity theft case?

204
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,200
每个案件都是
Every arrest I ever made.

205
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,780
所有被捕的人都说我抓错人了
They all say I got the wrong guy.

206
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,700
帮忙那些还活着的人  感觉一定很好
Must be nice, helping out people who are still alive.

207
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,420
一切还好吧
Everything okay?

208
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,780
卡特警探  我是唐纳利特工
Detective Carter. I'm Special Agent Donnelly.

209
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,890
我们上月在德兰西枪击案中合作过
We worked together on the Delancey shooting last month.

210
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,130
是的  什么风把你吹来了
Right, of course. What brings you back to the "A"?

211
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,950
实际上  就是你
You, actually.

212
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,560
什么事情
What's this about?

213
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,030
数月前你把一套指纹输入了自动指纹识别系统
You sent a set of fingerprints through AFIS a few months back

214
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,580
我在凶案组工作  这很正常
I work homicide. That tends to happen.

215
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,220
没错  这个引起了我们的注意
Yeah, well, these got our attention.

216
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,560
你的报告中
In your reports,

217
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,900
你称他为"西装男"
you refer to him as "the man in the suit."

218
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,630
我们认为  就是这个人攻击了我们
We think this may be the same man who assaulted my team

219
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,670
绑架了我们监管中的嫌犯
and kidnapped a suspect in our custody.

220
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,650
在我印象中
The way I remember it,

221
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,680
那个嫌犯之后洗净了全部嫌疑
the suspect was later cleared of all charges.

222
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,560
这不是重点  警探
That's beside the point, Detective.

223
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,880
目前  我们以为此人涉嫌
Now our agents believe that this man may be connected to

224
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,010
数年来的多宗谋杀及袭击悬案
dozens of unsolved homicides and assaults over the years,

225
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,970
其中相当一部分发生在最近六个月的纽约
Many of them here in New York in the last six months.

226
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,260
涉及退役军人的连环银行抢劫案
A series of bank robberies involving ex-military,

227
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,890
杀害前东德特务
Killing of a Stasi operative,

228
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,360
枪击毒贩  黑帮教父  甚至警察
shootings of drug dealers, gangsters, even police officers.

229
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,120
现在  据你推测
Now, you speculated,

230
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,150
根据你对此人的初步调查
based on your initial interview with this man,

231
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,700
他是退役军人  可能是前特种部队的
that he was former military, maybe special forces.

232
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,360
全在我的报告里了
It's all in my reports.

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,350
不不  没全
No. No, it's not.

234
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,230
远远没全
Not by a long shot.

235
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,330
什么时候抽一小时跟我聊聊  警察
When can you spare me an hour, detective?

236
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,860
我有东西给你看
I've got something to show you.

237
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,160
需要帮忙吗
Can I give you a hand with that?

238
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,440
-谢谢  -给我吧
- Thank you. - There you are.

239
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,290
我去查看三楼的公寓  芬奇
I'm taking a look at this third apartment, Finch.

240
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,660
查找任何能让我们确定是哪位海丝特的线索
Look for anything that might point to which Hester it belongs to

241
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,590
我们快没时间了
We're running out of time.

242
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,000
必须查出威胁来自何处
We need to find out where the threat's coming from.

243
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,300
不知道是哪位海丝特的
Don't know which Hester it belongs to,

244
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,460
不过我知道他们在做什么了
But I got an idea what they're mixed up in.

245
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,510
我置身在二亚甲基双氧苯丙胺实验室中
I'm standing in the middle of an MDMA lab.

246
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,860
摇头丸  你确定吗
Ecstasy. Are you sure?

247
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,970
不然的话  就是有人痴迷化学
Well, it's either that or someone's really into chemistry.

248
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,470
找到个能告诉我们实情的人
Found a guy who can tell us what's going on.

249
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,650
不过他一时半会儿没法说话
But he's not really in a talking mood right now.

250
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,480
看来我要有别的同伴了
Looks like I'm going to have more company soon.

251
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,560
-喂  -再会
- Hello? - Good-bye.

252
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,940
至少我们知道冒名者为何盗用海丝特的身份了
At least we know why our I.D. thief stole Hester's name.

253
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,130
摇头丸可以用合法的化学品合成
MDMA can be made with legal chemicals,

254
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,490
不过这些药剂是被监测的  一旦大批购入
But they're monitored. Buy in bulk,

255
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,900
就会引起当局的注意
and you draw the attention of the authorities.

256
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,230
但是如果你借用了别人的名字
But if you use someone else's name...

257
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,180
他们就束手无策了
They wind up holding the bag.

258
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,620
看来不只是你那位海丝特有工作
Looks like your Hester's not the only one who's employed.

259
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,750
乔丹的邮件表明她在古董店工作
Jordan's emails indicate that she works in antiques,

260
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,950
也许是采购员  或是经销商
Maybe as a buyer or a dealer.

261
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,640
乔丹
"Jordan"?

262
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,200
你们的关系已经亲密到直呼其名了吗
Are you on a first name basis already?

263
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,140
没有  我只是  讨厌用代称
No, I'm just... tired of using pronouns.

264
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,940
芬奇  我们的制毒者醒了
Hey, Finch, our ecstasy cook just woke up.

265
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,650
-怎么回事  -有人闯入
- What happened? - Some guy broke in.

266
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,390
-把我打晕了  -东西都没丢
- Got the drop on me. - Well, he didn't take anything.

267
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,320
我们现在有更严重的问题
We got a bigger problem right now.

268
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,830
-老大想见你  -什么
- The boss wants to meet. - What?

269
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,670
四年来我们从没见过老大
Four years and we've never even seen the boss.

270
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,520
-为什么现在忽然想见我  -不知道
- Why are we meeting him now? - I don't know.

271
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,080
肯定不是好事
This can't be good.

272
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,740
走吧  见面安排在一小时后
Come on, meeting's in an hour.

273
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,520
公寓租约上有海丝特的名字
Hester's name is on the lease for that co-op.

274
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,880
差别在于  老大是你那位海丝特还是我这位
Odds are, either your Hester or mine is the boss.

275
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,680
我们得跟紧点  芬奇
We need to stay close, Finch.

276
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,090
天  我想我跟丢她了
Dear. I think I just lost her.

277
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,940
有时我想要是他今天发表
Sometimes I wonder if he'd be published today.

278
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,140
{\an5}《审判》
弗兰兹・卡夫卡

279
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,490
那我肯定第一个排队买
I'd be first in line,

280
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,240
不过  我的腿脚不太容易抢到首名
but then, meandering exposition is kind of my thing.

281
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,490
抱歉  我无意冒犯
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

282
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,130
没有  这个  我叫哈罗德
No, that's-- I'm Harold.

283
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,170
我叫乔丹
Jordan.

284
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,890
失陪一下
Excuse me a moment.

285
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,880
你干嘛给我打电话
Why are you calling me?

286
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,610
你干嘛跟她聊天
Why are you talking to her?

287
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,480
因为我没有你那种隐形藏身的本领
Because I haven't your gift for avoiding people.

288
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
再说  她挺和善的
Besides, she seems nice,

289
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,650
而且对文学的品味很高
And she has excellent taste in literature.

290
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,000
又或者她发现了你在尾随她
Or she knows you're tailing her,

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,910
于是转回头来反戈一击
and she circled back for a closer look.

292
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,950
玛吉  我走啦  明天见
Maggie, I'm taking off. I'll see you tomorrow.

293
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,850
芬奇  海丝特行动了
Finch, Hester's on the move.

294
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,850
他可能要跟制毒者会面
He could be meeting up with the cooks.

295
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,750
我又跟丢她了
I've lost her again.

296
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,750
里瑟先生  你说的那个制毒者长什么样子
Mr. Reese, what did that drug cook look like?

297
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,870
是不是大块头  有点吓人
Big, kind of...terrifying?

298
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,400
绝对不是
Not even close.

299
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,390
如果我们错把这位女士当成了毒贩
If we've mistaken this woman for a drug dealer,

300
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,730
别人是不是也会这么想
isn't it possible that someone else has too?

301
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,450
一切皆有可能  芬奇
Anything's possible, Finch.

302
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,930
你带武器了吗
Did you bring a weapon?

303
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,450
我说过了  里瑟先生  我不喜欢武器
I told you, Mr. Reese. I don't like weapons.

304
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,820
那你就准备靠一张嘴说死他们吧
Well, you'd better be prepared to talk them to death,

305
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,500
还得快点儿
and you'd better do it fast,

306
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,510
因为我已经知道谁是冒名者了
Because I think I know which one of them is the imposter,

307
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,660
也就是说  你跟着的海丝特有麻烦了
which means your Hester is in trouble.

308
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,250
乔丹
Jordan!

309
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,330
你的外套忘了拿
You forgot your jacket.

310
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,440
你有危险  跟我走
You're in danger. Come with me.

311
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,360
那些是什么人
Who were those guys?

312
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,500
别回头  继续走
Don't look back. Just keep walking.

313
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,570
-你就是老大  -没错  是我
- So you're the boss? - Yeah, that's right.

314
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,590
别误会我的意思
Don't take this the wrong way,

315
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,970
但我们为什么要见面
but why are we meeting in person?

316
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,870
有人盯上我们了
Someone's onto us.

317
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,680
我们得弄完这批  马上转移
We need to finish this batch and relocate.

318
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,240
-黄樟醚不够了  -已经搞定了
- We're low on safrole. - Already got it covered.

319
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,970
看来我们弄清楚谁是谁了
Looks like we know who's who.

320
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,310
我这位是毒贩
My guy's the drug dealer.

321
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,650
而你那位毒贩
And your drug dealer has placed

322
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,740
将真正的乔丹・海丝特置于险境了
the real Jordan Hester in danger.

323
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,010
好了  快点  我们走吧
All right, come on. Hurry up. Let's go.

324
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,840
你好  莱奈尔
Hello, Lionel.

325
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,070
我看你那家伙是在制毒
Hey, I think your guy might be cooking ecstasy.

326
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,370
是吗
Is that so?

327
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,650
他六个月前被捕了
He got arrested six months ago

328
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,750
当时他一个下线被警方端了
when one of his distributors got popped.

329
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,350
毒品署有证据证明他在买化学品
Narcotics found evidence that he was buying chemicals,

330
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,150
但毒贩没办法指认他
But the distributor couldn't pick him out of a lineup,

331
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,060
所以他们只能放走海丝特
So they had to cut Hester loose.

332
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,970
毒贩只知道一个名字
All the distributor knew was a name.

333
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,740
他从没真正见过老大
He had actually never met the boss.

334
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,280
就这些了
So if that's it,

335
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,200
我现在能专心只为你打一份工了吧
then maybe I can just go back to doing one job for you, huh?

336
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,340
还不行
Not just yet.

337
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,740
海丝特  管他叫什么名字
Hester-- or whatever his name is--

338
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,130
反正非常在意保护自己的身份
is very serious about protecting his identity.

339
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,020
也许在意到会为此杀人灭口
Maybe serious enough to kill.

340
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,280
你觉得他会找上那姑娘吗
You think he'd go after the girl?

341
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,470
这正是我要知道的
That's what I need to know,

342
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,140
也正意味着你要查出
which means you need to find out

343
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,080
他是怎么偷她身份的
how he stole her identity.

344
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,800
那些人是谁
But who were those guys?

345
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,590
恐怕他们都是毒贩
I'm afraid they may be in the drug trade,

346
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,590
而且认为你也是
and they think you are too.

347
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,350
谢谢
Thanks.

348
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,050
这就是偷我身份的人吗  毒贩
That's who stole my identity? A drug dealer?

349
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,030
你知道自己身份被盗了
So you know about the I.D. Theft.

350
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,690
我知道几个星期了
I've known for a few weeks,

351
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,370
但我觉得已经被盗好几个月了
but I think it's been going on for months.

352
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,490
我一直在给我的信用卡公司和银行打电话
I kept calling my credit card company, my bank.

353
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,940
他们一直叫我报警
They kept telling me to call the police.

354
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,980
警察却一直叫我填各种报告
The cops just kept telling me to fill out more reports

355
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,510
然后给银行打电话
and call the bank.

356
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,480
白领犯罪总是不被
White collar crime is at the bottom

357
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,290
任何警察部门所重视
of every police department's to-do list.

358
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,880
这么说你不是警察
Well, I take it you're not a cop.

359
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,190
不算
Not quite.

360
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,380
{\an8}哈罗德・克劳
私家侦探

361
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,230
私家侦探
Private investigator?

362
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,110
有点推理小说家雷蒙德・钱德勒的感觉  是吗
It's very Raymond Chandler, isn't it

363
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,560
但恐怕现实会有些乏味
The reality is a little bit more mundane, I'm afraid,

364
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,240
大部分时间只是跟踪和拍照
Mostly following people around and taking pictures.

365
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,890
你为什么要跟踪我
Why were you following me?

366
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,330
另一个受害者雇的我
I've been hired by another victim.

367
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,410
警方同样没有为他做任何事
The police didn't do anything for him either.

368
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,310
-那我现在该怎么做  -现在吗
- So what do I do now? - Right now?

369
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,420
深呼吸  来杯茶
Breathe deep. Have a cup of tea.

370
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,860
有人在帮我跟踪
I have someone keeping an eye

371
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,810
偷你身份的人
on the man that stole your identity.

372
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,450
只要我们一有足够证据逮捕他
As soon as we have enough proof to arrest him,

373
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,090
就可以请警方介入了
we'll get the police involved.

374
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,990
富兰克林吗
You Franklin?

375
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,360
你一定就是弗斯科了
You must be Fusco.

376
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,930
德茨・富兰克林警探  身份盗窃小组的
Detective Dez Franklin, I.D. Theft Squad.

377
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,180
有什么可以效劳的
How can I help?

378
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,390
乔丹・海丝特  我们的受害者
Jordan Hester, she's our vic.

379
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,700
男人盗用女人的身份  这倒新鲜
A man stealing a woman's identity--that's a new one.

380
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,280
是啊  似乎已经用了一年了
Yeah, apparently, it's been going on for about a year now.

381
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,530
一年了  这么说不是为血拼大采购
A year? So we're not talking about a shopping spree at Best Buy.

382
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,360
他在用她的身份为犯罪活动做掩护  是吗
He's using her I.D. as a cover for criminal activity, right?

383
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,340
-我们认为他在生产摇头丸  -不是吧
- We think he's cooking E. - Seriously?

384
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,730
有什么不对的地方
Why do you find that so strange?

385
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,710
去年有个案子
This case last year.

386
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,760
嫌犯在整个审讯阶段都坚持自己是无辜的
Suspect claimed he was innocent all the way through trial,

387
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,540
说有人盗用了他的身份
said somebody stole his identity.

388
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,670
没人相信他吗
No one believed him?

389
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,880
我的部门每天会抓进来一百多个嫌疑犯
My unit catches upwards of 100 new complaints every day.

390
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,030
不能谁说自己无辜我们都相信吧
Can't bring us in every time somebody says he didn't do it.

391
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,990
-罪名是什么  -意图制造毒品
- What was the charge? - Manufacture with intent.

392
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,330
制摇头丸
Making ecstasy.

393
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,490
凯尔・莫里森
Kyle Morrison.

394
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,260
我确定他还在狱中
I'm pretty sure he's still locked up.

395
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,480
我来结账
I'll take this.

396
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,130
该我上场了
That's my cue.

397
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
我是富兰克林警探
I'm Detective Franklin.

398
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,010
我想就一系列信用卡盗窃事件和你谈谈
I'd like to talk to you about a string of credit card thefts

399
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,910
我们已经发现你围裙下的扫描仪了
We already know about the scanner you keep under your apron.

400
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,500
-纽约凶案组  -你好  我是弗斯科警探
- NYPD homicide. - Yes, it's Detective Fusco.

401
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,460
我想查一名叫凯尔・莫里森的囚犯
I'm looking for an inmate by the name of Kyle Morrison.

402
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,930
能告诉我他被关在哪里吗
Can you tell me where he's being held?

403
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,930
我查一下
Let me see that.

404
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,090
希望你用茶还愉快  芬奇
Hope you're enjoying your tea, Finch.

405
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,680
我准备上前检查一下海丝特的货车
I'm going to take a closer look at Hester's van.

406
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,230
这家伙上哪儿都带着他的电脑
The guy takes his computer with him everywhere.

407
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,810
他甚至比你还谨慎  芬奇
He's even more careful than you are, Finch.

408
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,340
我大概需要你帮忙解开他的
I might need a little help cracking his--

409
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,280
不必了
Never mind.

410
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,420
笔记本没设密码
Laptop's not password-protected.

411
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,980
看来他没我想得那么谨慎  芬奇
Guess he's not as careful as I thought, Finch.

412
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,230
好吧  没看到任何贩毒盈利的秘密账户
Okay, not seeing any secret accounts full of drug profits

413
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,570
也没关于贩毒的信息
or messages about business.

414
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,700
能给你更多筹码  有效掌控
To give you more leverage and control--

415
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,760
贩毒老手什么时候开始
And since when do seasoned drug dealers

416
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,280
需要从网上查找"须知"了
need how-to tips from the internet?

417
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,450
我错过了一场客户会议
I missed a client meeting.

418
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,600
你靠什么谋生的
What do you do for a living?

419
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,230
严格说来  我是自由职业买家
Well, technically I'm a freelance buyer,

420
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,710
但没人明白那是干嘛的
but no one really knows what that means.

421
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,210
-买什么的  -古董
- Buyer of what? - Antiques.

422
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,760
我喜欢有历史的东西
You know, I love old stuff.

423
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,310
-比如书  -特别是书
- Like books. - Especially books.

424
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,630
我买不起我喜欢的东西
I can't really afford to buy the stuff I like,

425
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,080
所以别人雇我  我就帮他们买古董
so people hire me and I buy old stuff for them.

426
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,240
有点像住狗窝的室内设计师
Kind of like a interior decorator with cobwebs.

427
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,060
听上去很有意思
Sounds like fun.

428
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,570
用艺术学位做这个  有点丢人
Well, it's an embarrassing use of an arts degree,

429
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,670
但这是我的梦想
but it's my dream.

430
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,630
我希望有天能有一家自己的店
You know, someday I'd love to own my own shop.

431
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,540
当然前提是  这身份被盗的事
That is, if this whole I.D. thing

432
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
别永远地毁掉我的信用记录
hasn't permanently ruined my credit,

433
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,530
否则就至死方休了
or I don't wind up dead.

434
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,850
知道我什么时候可以回家吗
Any idea when I can go home?

435
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,870
我觉得现在太危险了
I think it's too dangerous right now.

436
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,930
万一那帮人查到了你家地址怎么办
What if these guys figured out where you live?

437
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,710
我们会给你找间酒店
We should get you a hotel room.

438
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,680
我能不能至少回去收点东西
Can I at least pack a bag?

439
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,320
我不认为这是明智之举
I'm not sure that's wise.

440
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,140
就算你陪着我也不行吗
Even if you came with me?

441
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,670
这就是下次全部的货吗
So this is our entire next shipment?

442
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,430
你上哪儿弄的这个  闻上去有点不一样
Where'd you get this stuff? It smells a little different.

443
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,150
因为这次纯度更高
That's because it's even more pure.

444
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,680
快开始做
Now let's start the cook.

445
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,900
那这批货弄好要多长时间
So this batch will be ready in, what?

446
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,290
24小时吗
24 hours or so?

447
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,520
你当是我奶奶煮饭呢
If my nana was cooking it.

448
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,930
你是凶案组的吗
You're homicide?

449
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,520
你们觉得我还杀了人吗
You guys think I killed someone too?

450
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,540
这不是我此行的目的
That's not why I'm here.

451
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,860
所以你只是想过来戳我痛处吗
What, so you just want to rub it in?

452
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,680
那么  恭喜你  你做到了
Well, congratulations. You got me.

453
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,620
我觉得你没做
I thought you didn't do it.

454
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,310
我不是毒贩
I'm not a drug dealer.

455
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,290
多年来我一直这么说
I've been saying that for a year.

456
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,700
但没人肯相信我
Nobody's believed me yet.

457
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,600
一次是贼  终生是贼
Once a suspect, always a suspect.

458
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,580
这不是纽约警察的官方座右铭吗
Isn't that the official NYPD motto?

459
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,290
你第一次何时意识到自己的身份被盗
When did you know your identity was first stolen?

460
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,150
当警察来敲我家门
When the cops knocked down my door,

461
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,320
拿枪顶着我脑袋的时候
put a shotgun to my head.

462
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,400
那是什么时候  一年前吧
And that was what? A year ago?

463
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,830
要我说
You know what?

464
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,300
跟你们这帮人说的越多
The more I talked to you guys,

465
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,210
你们越能扭曲我的话
the more you twisted my words around.

466
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,460
所以  我今天大概没心情说话
So, you know, maybe today I'm not in the mood.

467
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,090
我们觉得发生在你身上的事
We think what happened to you

468
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,300
可能在别人身上重演了
may have happened to someone else.

469
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,340
坐下
Sit down.

470
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,000
我知道你没理由相信我
Look, I know you got no reason to trust me.

471
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,800
我很明白你的感受
I know exactly how you feel.

472
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,830
每个人都误解了你
Everyone's got you wrong.

473
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,070
每个人都冤枉了你
Everyone thinks you're something that you're not,

474
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,590
而你却没法改变他们的想法
And you got no way to change their mind.

475
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,680
你帮我抓住这家伙
You help me catch this guy,

476
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,410
我想办法把你弄出去
and I'll see about getting you out of here.

477
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,060
你相信我吗
You believe me?

478
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,720
除非让我无法相信
Until you give me reason not to.

479
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,460
在  在一开始  只是钱有问题
When it--when it started, it was just the money.

480
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,130
我打给银行  他们就关闭了账户
I'd call the bank, and then they'd close the account,

481
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,200
然后立马又有一个账户冒了出来
but then another one would pop right back up.

482
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,240
很快  我的信用纪录完了
Before long, my credit was shot,

483
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,540
存款没了
my savings were gone.

484
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,890
没法还贷款  没法养家
Couldn't pay my mortgage. I couldn't support my family.

485
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,480
然后警察就出现了
And then the cops came rolling up.

486
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,380
你有孩子吗
You got kids?

487
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,820
我儿子九岁了
My boy's nine.

488
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,660
上个月错过了我女儿的两岁生日
Missed my daughter's second birthday last month.

489
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,490
她妈妈再也不想和我有任何交集了
Her mother doesn't want anything to do with me anymore.

490
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,270
你帮我抓住这家伙
Look, you help me catch this guy,

491
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,580
我将尽我所能让你回家见你的宝贝女儿
and I'll do my best to get you home and see your little girl

492
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,780
我向你保证
I give you my word.

493
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,430
有点不对劲
Something's not right here.

494
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,410
见鬼  我们没时间了
Damn it, we're out of time.

495
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,340
警察已经在过来的路上了
The cops are on their way here right now.

496
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,510
什么  怎么会
What? How?

497
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,460
管它为什么  我们得赶快把成品运走
Who cares? We've gotta get this merch out of here fast.

498
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,360
那制毒怎么办
What about the cook?

499
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,870
别管它了  这实验室完蛋了
Forget it, this lab is burned.

500
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,320
把指纹都擦干净  我把东西装起来
Wipe everything down for prints. I'm gonna pack this stuff up

501
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,100
没有危险
It's okay.

502
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,360
太好了
Oh, okay.

503
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,880
为什么到处都是毛巾
Why are there towels everywhere?

504
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,280
是啊  自动喷水灭火系统昨天启动了
Yeah, sprinkler system went off yesterday.

505
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,420
-某个傻瓜触发了火警  -真奇怪
- Some idiot pulled the alarm. - How odd.

506
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,240
我替你订好了一间酒店
I've arranged a hotel room for you,

507
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,800
如果你想收拾一下东西
if you want to collect your things.

508
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,560
稍等一下
In a minute.

509
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,760
我们没有时间耽误了
We really shouldn't linger.

510
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,560
我知道  但这么一天下来
I know, but after the day I've had,

511
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,340
我需要喝点比茶水更烈的
I could use something a little stronger than tea.

512
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,240
这些是受害者的账户
Here's the victim's accounts.

513
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,080
能看出这些开支有什么问题吗
You recognize any of these charges?

514
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,120
五金店
Hardware stores.

515
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,830
我的账户上也有很多五金店的交易
There were a lot of those on my accounts too.

516
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,370
还有大量化学品的买入
And bulk purchases of chemicals.

517
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,440
这是警察用来指控我的证据
That's what the cops used as evidence against me.

518
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,320
-供实验室用  -应该是
- Supplies for the labs. - I guess.

519
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,800
还看出别的什么吗
Recognize anything else?

520
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,050
好吧
Okay.

521
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,090
这些是银行方面的证词
These are the bank statements.

522
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,430
-能看出什么吗  -等等  
- You recognize anything here? - Wait.

523
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,140
你为什么会有她的照片
Why do you have a picture of her?

524
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,020
这是乔丹・海丝特  她是受害者
That's Jordan Hester. She's the victim.

525
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,740
不不不  她是玛丽
No, no, no, that's Mary.

526
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,510
她是我会计师的接待员
She was the receptionist at my accountant's office.

527
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,710
玛丽?
Mary?

528
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,370
失陪一下
Excuse me a minute.

529
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,610
擦干净之后  赶紧出去
When you're done with the wipe-down, get the hell out,

530
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,380
我找到新的实验室会再和你们联系
and I'll be in touch when I find a new lab.

531
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,140
找和上一间那样带天窗的
Get one with skylights like the last one.

532
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,460
我们加热磷粉时能更好地通风
It's better ventilation for when we heat the phosphorous.

533
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,050
当然可以  什么都行
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

534
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,540
快点
Let's move!

535
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,870
磷粉是用来制作冰毒的  老大
Phosphorous is used to make meth, "Boss."

536
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,210
而且上一间实验室根本没有天窗
And the last place didn't have any skylights.

537
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,970
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

538
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,400
我觉得我们弄反了  芬奇
I think we may have gotten this backwards, Finch.

539
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,010
我跟的海丝特不是冒充者
My Hester's not the identity thief,

540
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,510
也就是说  你跟的才是
which means yours is.

541
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,570
{\an8}弗斯科
是那个女人

542
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,560
我知道了
I know.

543
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,980
出事了吗  哈罗德
Something wrong, Harold?

544
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,320
我不知道你是谁  但你不是老大
I don't know who you are, but you're not the boss.

545
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,240
别傻了  把枪放下
Don't be an idiot. Put the gun down.

546
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,500
老大  老大  警察就在外面
Boss, boss, the cops are outside.

547
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,840
大家尽量多拿点
Everybody grab what they can.

548
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,050
他就是把我揍晕的人
That's the guy who knocked me out.

549
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,100
我们没时间纠缠了
We don't have time for this.

550
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,980
我知道你是真正的乔丹・海丝特
I know you're the real Jordan Hester.

551
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,230
那你就该知道我哪儿也不会去
Then you know I'm not going anywhere.

552
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
我好像有点不舒服
I don't think I feel very well.

553
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,980
实际上  我很确定
In fact, I'm certain of it.

554
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,250
我感觉很晕
I feel quite discombobu--

555
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,110
晕  眩
Bobu--bobu--

556
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,120
会过去的  哈罗德
It'll pass, Harold.

557
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,030
别担心  马上  你就会感觉很好的
Don't worry. Pretty soon, you'll feel much better.

558
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,040
告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you are.

559
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,450
现在  我是谁不重要
Who I am doesn't matter right now.

560
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,750
重要的是  我知道你是谁
What matters is, I know who you are.

561
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,220
那我是谁  别过来
Who am I, then? Stay back.

562
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,140
-我会开枪的  -怎么开
- I will shoot you. - How?

563
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,450
保险还开着呢
the safety's still on.

564
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,830
无意冒犯
No offense,

565
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,790
但真不敢相信你居然把这群人骗了这么久
but I'm surprised you fooled these guys as long as you did.

566
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,100
你真觉得毒贩会穿成你这样吗
Is that really how you think a drug dealer dresses?

567
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,770
我知道你是真正的乔丹・海丝特
I know you're the real Jordan Hester.

568
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,530
我知道你的生活被偷走了
I know your life was stolen.

569
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,340
给你  我甚至知道是谁偷的
Here. I even know who stole it.

570
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,310
绑那一个
Do the other one.

571
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,320
那  是谁偷的
Well, who stole it?

572
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,620
先解决当务之急
First things first.

573
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,470
你是如何计划的
What exactly was your plan?

574
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,960
你被指控贩毒
You were accused of being a drug dealer,

575
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,990
所以就决定成为毒贩吗
so then you decided to become one?

576
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,250
没有人会相信我
No one would believe me.

577
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,860
而我又一直很内向
And I was always a bit of an introvert,

578
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,950
很注重隐私
you know, a private person.

579
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,950
是啊  我很熟这类人
Yeah, I know the type.

580
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,070
我从未想到这样会惹祸上身
I never thought that I would be punished for it.

581
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,500
我之前的老板  警察
My old boss, police--

582
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,310
人们一听说你是贩毒的
People hear you're a drug dealer,

583
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,480
就不愿再听你解释了
they stop listening to you.

584
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,100
你有没有陷入最低谷的时候
I mean, have you ever hit bottom?

585
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,820
我不知道自己能陷得多深
I never realized how far down I could go.

586
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,780
过了一阵子  我明白了
After a while, I figured,

587
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,000
如果别人硬要说我是这种坏人
if people keep thinking I'm this bad guy,

588
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,070
我又何必喋喋不休地说服他们我不是呢
why do I keep trying to convince them that I'm not?

589
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,830
有人偷走了你的身份
Someone stole your identity,

590
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,770
所以你决定要偷走他们的
so you decided to steal theirs.

591
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,980
是的  只要拖到能捣毁这间实验室就行
Well, yeah, but only long enough to destroy this lab.

592
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,870
那是硝酸  不是黄樟醚
That's nitric acid, not safrole.

593
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,560
它能腐蚀一切  摧毁这些仪器
It'll melt all this into mush, destroy this equipment.

594
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,500
然后我打算拿走剩下的库存
And then I was going to take the rest of this supply,

595
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,090
大概价值五十万美元
about $1/2 million worth,

596
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,290
以此将那混蛋引到光天化日之下
to lure that bastard out into the open.

597
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,560
然后怎么办  杀了他吗
And then what? Kill him?

598
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,630
我不想杀人
I don't want to kill anybody.

599
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,240
我只想拿回我的身份
I just want my identity back.

600
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,030
好吧
Okay.

601
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,840
这计划真烂
It's a terrible plan.

602
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,320
不过我喜欢  我们行动吧
But I like it, so let's do it.

603
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,850
首先你必须知道的
First thing you need to know,

604
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,730
那个混蛋不是他  而是她
the bastard isn't a he. She's a she.

605
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,890
芬奇  你在吗
Finch, are you there?

606
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,770
确定一定以及肯定
I most certainly am.

607
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,780
你得从那里出来
You need to get out of there.

608
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,160
他并未计划杀了她
He wasn't planning to kill her,

609
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,230
所以一定是她在计划杀了他
So she must still be planning to kill him.

610
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,690
为什么  我从不
Why, I never...

611
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,580
哈罗德?
Harold?

612
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,770
你还好吗
You all right?

613
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,630
-我确信你给我下了毒  -摇头丸
- I believe you've drugged me. - Ecstasy.

614
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,360
我说过  你会感觉很好的
I told you you'd feel better.

615
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,700
我的多巴胺和去甲肾上腺素水平现在是
My dopamine and norepinephrine levels are...

616
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,290
但我清楚这个过程
But if I understand this process,

617
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,900
我就能计算出
I can counter the ef--

618
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,090
你好呀
Well, hello there.

619
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,820
不这样就得开枪
Well, it was either this or shoot you.

620
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,990
我发现化学品
I find chemistry...

621
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,150
效率要高得多
so much more efficient.

622
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,500
芬奇  我这边都搞定了
Finch, I've got this end under control.

623
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,850
我们准备给我们共同的朋友一份惊喜
We're preparing a surprise for our mutual friend.

624
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,310
《我们共同的朋友》  作者查尔斯・狄更斯
Our Mutual Friend, Charles Dickens,

625
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,510
出版于  1864或65年
published...1864, '65.

626
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,060
情节是一桩隐藏身份的案子
The plot turns on a case of concealed identity!

627
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,170
多么讽刺
How ironic.

628
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,020
你有这本书吗
Hey, do you have a copy?

629
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,320
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

630
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,150
芬奇  你还好吗
Finch, are you all right?

631
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,920
好得不能再好了
Never been all right-er.

632
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,990
但我好像被人坑了
But I might have been outfoxed.

633
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,440
芬奇被坑了
Finch outfoxed.

634
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,200
芬奇  你怎么了
Finch, what's going on?

635
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,380
你究竟在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

636
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,740
芬
Fi--

637
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,830
芬奇
Finch?

638
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,660
那是我很好很好的朋友
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, that is my very good friend.

639
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,040
是谁
Who was it?

640
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,480
他是谁  他在哪里
Who is he? Where is he?

641
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,060
无关紧要的地方
Nowhere that matters,

642
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,560
不在实验室里噢
and not in the lab.

643
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,820
不
No.

644
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,150
乔瑟夫  是我
Joseph, it's me.

645
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,850
你必须赶到实验室去  不  现在
You need to get to the lab. No, now.

646
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,090
麻烦比我想象中的大
We've got bigger problems than I thought.

647
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,080
我现在有些事要处理
I'm taking care of things here.

648
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,990
在那里碰头
I'll meet you there.

649
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,430
我喜欢侧过来看你的脸
I like your face sideways.

650
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,220
抱歉了  哈罗德
I'm sorry, Harold.

651
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,890
一定要快  弗斯科
Fast as you can, Fusco.

652
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,820
上城区十二号街851号  芬奇出事了
851 12th Street, the Village. Finch is in trouble.

653
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,680
好的  我上路了
All right, I'm on it.

654
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,260
你服役时的安全级别
You've still got your security clearance

655
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,780
还保留着  警探
from your time in the army, Detective,

656
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,630
所以我能带你进来
So I can show you this.

657
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,800
联调局通常不会启动机密行动
The FBI doesn't run classified ops

658
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,730
除非涉及  国家安全问题
unless there's issues of... National security.

659
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,830
以前是中情局跟我们紧密合作
Used to be the CIA worked closely with us,

660
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,850
后来停止了
then they stopped.

661
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,230
极端行动成了他们的做事准则
Extreme action became the norm.

662
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,470
绑票  偷渡  暗杀
Kidnappings, renditions, assassinations,

663
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,170
更糟的是  我们认为有些他们甚至是
and worse, we think they did some of these things

664
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,340
在美国本土做的
right here in the U.S.

665
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,010
为了启动机密行动
And to run these ops,

666
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,130
他们需要危险的  往往有反社会倾向的人
They needed dangerous, often sociopathic men...

667
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,980
就像你一直追查的家伙
Like the one you've been chasing.

668
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,690
但我们认为  他已经离开了局里
But at some point, we think this man left the agency.

669
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,690
开始的时候  我们无迹可寻
Initially, the pattern was chaotic,

670
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,330
现在已经有了大致的方向
but now a trend has emerged.

671
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,240
我想我们知道他来纽约做什么
We think we know what he's doing here in New York.

672
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,580
做什么呢
And what is that?

673
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,590
我们认为他现在是赏金猎人  价高者得
We think he's selling his services to the highest bidder.

674
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,670
我们遇到过类似的案子  墨西哥特种部队
We've seen it before, Mexican special forces

675
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,850
接手了华瑞兹市的毒品生意
taking over the drug trade in Juarez,

676
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,880
前英国空军特别部队在利比亚兜售血钻
ex-British SAS selling blood diamonds in Liberia...

677
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,800
像他们这种人  一旦退役
Men like that, they're done fighting,

678
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,080
社会上没有他们的容身之地
there's no place for them in society,

679
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,810
于是就将他们逼成了危险分子
which makes them very dangerous.

680
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,500
我们相信他跟某个
We believe he's been working with one

681
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,910
有组织犯罪团伙合作
of the organized crime syndicates,

682
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,680
尤其是一个叫以利亚的人
Specifically a man named Elias.

683
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,100
你觉得他在为以利亚卖命吗
You think he's working for Elias?

684
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,110
我们安插在俄罗斯黑手党的线人汇报
One of our contacts in the Russian mob told us

685
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,150
他把他们派去追杀以利亚的人全放倒了
he took out a team they sent to kill Elias.

686
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,090
现在中情局已经在着手处理这件事了
Now the CIA is already trying to clean up this mess.

687
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,360
我们知道你一直跟斯诺特工有联系
We know that you've been contacted by this man, agent Snow.

688
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,260
我们相信他就是中情局负责
We believe that he's the man the agency uses

689
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,450
为境内特别行动提供掩护的人
to sweep these domestic ops under the rug.

690
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,710
告诉我
Tell me...

691
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,340
局里对这个为什么感兴趣
what's the bureau's interest in this?

692
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,440
你又为什么感兴趣
What's your interest?

693
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,630
想跟中情局搞鬼吗
You want to put one over on the CIA?

694
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,560
没错  我要揭露中情局的行径
Yes, I want to expose the CIA for what it's become,

695
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,180
但最主要的  我想将他绳之于法
but...mainly, I want to catch him.

696
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,060
我们不能让那群政府的恶棍打手
We can't have rogue government hit men

697
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,560
插手国内事务
operating on domestic soil.

698
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,780
很显然你也这么认为
Obviously you feel the same.

699
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,760
所以你才小心地追查他
That's why you've been so vigilant in pursuing him.

700
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,630
-可惜没收获  -快了
- Without much luck. - So far.

701
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,410
你一直单枪匹马作战
But you've been working alone.

702
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,480
现在你有局里做后盾
Now you'll have the bureau's support.

703
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,150
我们得翻查之前的案子
We're going back to all the old cases,

704
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,880
重新调查目击者  审视证物
reinterviewing witnesses, looking at physical evidence,

705
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,300
除了你的报告之外
So beyond your report,

706
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,470
还有别的什么线索吗
is there anything else you can share with us?

707
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,350
没什么了
Nothing comes to mind.

708
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,620
不过  有的话我会通知你
But, I'll keep you informed.

709
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,480
放心  警官
Rest assured, detective.

710
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,790
我们会抓到他
We'll find him.

711
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,210
-你一个人  -什么
- You alone? - What?

712
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,910
你好  警官  刚好吃晚饭
Hello, detective, just in time for dinner.

713
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
随便坐  快好了
Have a seat. Almost ready.

714
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,500
快餐
Fast food.

715
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,580
很不好
Very bad.

716
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,890
-那是什么  -她做给我的
- What is that? - She made it for me.

717
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,440
红烧的噢
It's some kind of flambe.

718
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,050
等下  等下  还没好呢
Wait, wait, wait, it's not quite ready.

719
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,160
来吧  先把你弄出去
Come on, let's get you out of here.

720
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,770
好哒
Okay.

721
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,760
这边  这边
This way, this way.

722
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,100
我找到他了
I got him.

723
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,080
很好  谢谢  莱奈尔
Good. Thanks, Lionel.

724
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,800
我们搞定后再打给你
I'll call you as soon as we're clear.

725
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,100
我们走
Let's go.

726
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,220
别动
Don't move!

727
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,590
把包放下  把包放下
Drop the bags. Drop the bags.

728
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,650
你好  海丝特先生
Hello, Mr. Hester.

729
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,880
你真以为自己能接手我的生意吗
Did you really think you could take over my operation?

730
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,230
你来了  不是吗
Well, you're here, aren't you?

731
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,650
说得好
Touche.

732
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,920
我在考虑把你的名字多用一段时间
I'm thinking of keeping your name a little longer.

733
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,050
毕竟
After all...

734
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,980
我做乔丹・海丝特可比你做得好
I'm a better Jordan Hester than you've ever been.

735
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,000
把他们干掉
Get rid of them.

736
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,040
这里的化学品足够处理尸体了
More than enough chemicals in here to deal with the bodies.

737
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

738
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,390
我有很重要的东西要给你看
I've got something important to show you.

739
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,790
是吗  什么
Yeah, yeah, what's that?

740
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,100
盐酸

现在  我下一个要扮谁

男人太有报复心了

某一刻  我是有这么想过

不过  我只是在假扮你  不是吗
But then, I was just playing you, wasn't I?

对了  你这个乔丹・海丝特做得很糟糕
