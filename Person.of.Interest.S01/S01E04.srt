00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,090
再看  小个子答复了点什么  就这
And look, little guy says something back, right there.

153
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,870
你知道他叫什么  住哪儿吗
Well, did you get his name, his address?

154
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,080
有  他是马登利纳的一个律师助理
Yeah, he's a paralegal from Marmostein Ribner.

155
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,010
名叫伯戴特
Name's burdett.

156
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,120
你觉得这个伯戴特听到了点东西
You think this Burdett heard something?

157
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,080
没准就能帮你找到那人
Might lead you to your guy.

158
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,420
这些女人都是谁
Who are these women?

159
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,560
本顿的猎物
Benton's conquests?

160
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,850
-梅根・提尔曼在里面吗的吗  -没有
- Any of them Megan Tillman? - No.

161
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,340
他还没上网查她
He hasn't researched her online.

162
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,960
他甚至还没有查她公寓周围
He hasn't even looked up the area of her apartment

163
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,500
或者是医院周围
Or the hospital.

164
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,120
他跟医生之间的没有任何关联
There's nothing to connect him to our doctor.

165
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,570
他很谨慎
He's careful...

166
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,990
花样百出
Methodical.

167
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,550
也许他不是总那么小心
Maybe he wasn't always so careful.

168
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,040
我过滤了一遍他的履历
I've been combing through his history.

169
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,740
本顿先生有一个已经被撤销的大学旧记录
Mr. Benton has an old college record that's been expunged.

170
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,160
也许有助于帮我们了解这个人
Might illuminate what kind of a man we're dealing with.

171
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,940
但  我们要权限
But-- - we need access,

172
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,230
而我刚好认识个能帮忙的人
And I know someone who can help.

173
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,120
我对你跟弗斯科警探之间
I'm not all that comfortable

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,840
的协议并不是很放心
With your arrangement with detective fusco.

175
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,910
他很有用
He's an asset.

176
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,440
他是个想谋杀你的腐败警察
He's a corrupt police officer that tried to murder you.

177
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,960
他不是第一个要杀我的人
He's not the first person who's tried to kill me.

178
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,030
弗斯科会是个好同志
Fusco will stay in line.

179
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,900
你的警探宠物现在是很乖  里瑟先生
Your detective is a nice pet to keep, Mr. Reese,

180
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,350
但是早晚
But sooner or later...

181
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
会反咬你一口
He'll bite you back.

182
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,870
怎么回事  你连你老爹都跟不上了
What's the matter? You can't keep up with your old man, huh?

183
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,810
我去捡
I got it.

184
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,730
请问下  是弗斯科警探么
Excuse me, Detective Fusco?

185
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,280
你们几个是干什么的
Who are you guys supposed to be?

186
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,740
我们几个是干贩毒的
We're supposed to be drug dealers,

187
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,510
出了一帮蠢的要死的死条子
Except a group of very foolish cops

188
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
偷走了我们的货
Stole most of our product.

189
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,730
我不懂了
You got me confused.

190
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,220
你们得去找斯蒂尔斯警探
Detective Stills is the guy you want.

191
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,420
斯蒂尔斯失踪了
Stills is missing,

192
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,710
而其余你的那些黑条子兄弟都吃了官司蹲了号
And the rest of your dirty cop friends are in jail.

193
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,320
只剩下你了
That leaves you

194
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,160
这批货是市值一百万的可卡因
On the hook for a million dollars worth of cocaine.

195
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,540
我们要追回我们的货款
We want our money.

196
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,470
那我去柜员机上直接给你们取现提款好了
Let me go to the A.T.M., make a withdrawal.

197
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,350
爸  还扯啥呢  我们再来玩啊
Dad, come on, let's play.

198
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,930
马上来  小子
Just a minute, buddy.

199
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,900
我们的下一代  他们
Our children-- They, uh...

200
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,760
看到太多暴力了
They see too much violence.

201
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,250
你脖子上带着一颗好头颅
You have a good head on your shoulders.

202
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,330
两天之内给我们送钱过去  这样你还能顶着脑袋
Bring us the money in two days, and you get to come home

203
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,580
回家看孩子
To your son with it still attached.

204
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,520
双赢
Win-win.

205
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,060
医生已经在吧台蹲了一个晚上了
Doctor has been parked at the bar all night.

206
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,050
目前为止  不见本顿
So far, no sign of Benton.

207
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,030
她白天在医院干16个小时
She puts in 16-hour days at the hospital,

208
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,650
晚上出来瞎混
Stays out all night.

209
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,450
为什么
Why?

210
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,930
是什么在驱使她
What's driving her?

211
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,510
芬奇  你等下
Uh, Finch, hold on a second.

212
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,150
主角终于登场了
Man of the hour just showed up.

213
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,660
一杯马蒂尼  满上
Just a martini, up.

214
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,090
日子漫长  工作劳神  好容易撑到下班
Long day, stressful job, finally off the clock,

215
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,240
就只想一个人清净
And you just want some peace,

216
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,050
但总有那么一些不知趣的蠢材跑来打搅你
But some clueless idiot keeps brothering you.

217
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,640
吧台前的独身女子么  你还能指望些什么
Girl alone at a bar-- what do you expect?

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,440
我不是在说你
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.

219
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,830
如果你还没注意到
In case you haven't noticed,

220
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,580
我正拿着棍子抽他们呢
I'm beating them off with a stick here.

221
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,170
是吗
Is that so?

222
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,980
什么都好  就是千万别给我上酒
Whatever you do, do not offer to buy me another drink.

223
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,590
我叫凯特
Well, I'm Kate.

224
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,060
安德鲁
Andrew.

225
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,280
很高兴认识你
It's nice to meet you.

226
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,200
为什么她要用假名
Why is she using a false name?

227
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,670
我刚好要去外面透透气
Well, I was just about to go get some fresh air.

228
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,160
这么巧  我能跟你一起么
Yeah, you know what? Do you mind if I join you?

229
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,230
-你要去哪  -不知道
 - Where are you headed? - I don't know.

230
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,450
你常逛夜店  你来说
You're the club guy. You tell me.

231
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,670
凌晨三点  市里多半都打烊了
3:00 A.M., town's pretty much closing down.

232
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,770
我倒是知道个地方  就在这个转角附近
I do know a place right around the corner--

233
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,790
齐全的酒吧  床很舒服
Full bar, comfy bed.

234
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,070
你家啊
Oh, your place.

235
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,510
你想不想去我家
Oh, do you want to go to my place?

236
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,860
当然行
Sure.

237
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,480
来嘛  你想干什么都成
Come on, we'll do whatever you want.

238
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,790
出去玩  喝两杯
We'll hang out, have some drinks--

239
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,470
或者弄点更嗨的
Maybe something stronger.

240
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,610
我明早还有早班
I have to work early in the morning,

241
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,130
下次吧
But maybe next time.

242
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,710
你知道上哪找我
You know where to find me.

243
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:24,710
<font color="#4096d1">疑犯追踪 第1季 第4集</font>
<font color="#4096d1">字幕翻译：YYeTs人人影视</font>

244
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,760
等等
Wait a minute.

245
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,600
她在干嘛
What's she doing?

246
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,350
我还不知道  但是她肯定另有打算
I'm not sure, but she's up to something.

247
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,610
芬奇
Finch...

248
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,790
不是本顿在尾行医生
Benton's not stalking the doctor.

249
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,550
是医生在尾行他
She's stalking him.

250
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,270
是我
It's me.

251
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,000
我知道已经晚了
I know it's late.

252
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,200
这是我的错  我现在懂了
It was my fault. I know that now.

253
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,150
我想要忘记这一切  但我做不到
I tried to put it out of my head, but I can't.

254
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,430
表紧张  莱奈尔
Easy there, Lionel.

255
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,210
上回你拿枪指着我
Last time you pointed a gun at me,

256
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,680
就没好果子吃对不对  你还来
It didn't end in your favor, now, did it?

257
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,910
是你不该神出鬼没
You shouldn't sneak up like that,

258
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,350
斗牛帮毒贩最近盯上我了
With the thugs from the Toreros Cartel after me.

259
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,670
锡那罗亚州的那个斗牛帮吗
Toreros from Sinaloa?

260
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,640
我在墨西哥呆过
I spent a little time in Mexico.

261
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,960
那你该知道他们是个行刑队
You know that they're a death squad.

262
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,100
跟他们对上  人头落地
You cross them, and your head winds up in a bag.

263
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,270
但你已经跟他们对上了
But you've already crossed them.

264
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,560
安德鲁・本顿被注销的犯罪记录  你倒是有没有
Andrew Benton's expunged record--do you have it?

265
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,100
我还附送了你点彩头  法医报告也在里面
Even an added bonus-- I got the M.E. Report.

266
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,120
漂亮
Wonderful.

267
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,740
我给你做的够多了
I do a lot of things for you.

268
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,850
你还想让我继续干的话  你就得保护我
You want me to keep doing them, you got to protect me.

269
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,060
你得把那些人做掉
You got to take these guys out.

270
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,660
就是说我现在要给你打工了
So I'm working for you now?

271
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,600
不然我就没法帮你了
It's either them or me.

272
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,290
纽约的腐败警察多了去了  莱奈尔
Lots of crooked cops in this town, Lionel.

273
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,690
找个像你一样能干活的警察
It's not gonna be hard to find another one

274
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,210
还不简单吗
Just as useful as you...

275
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,270
还没那么多负担
With less baggage.

276
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,650
请给我报告
The report, please.

277
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,960
我已经很客气了
I did say "Please."

278
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,680
这才对嘛
That's the spirit.

279
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,750
芬奇  我知道为什么医生在尾行本顿了
Finch, I know why the doctor's stalking Benton.

280
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,170
96年时候  本顿是纽约大学四年级生
In '96, when Benton was a senior at N.Y.U.,

281
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,420
他性侵了一个才入学的新生女孩子
He sexually assaulted a freshman girl

282
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,310
就在一个兄弟会晚会上
At a fraternity rush party.

283
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,010
她的口供中说她想要取悦本顿
Uh, she said in her statement that she wanted to impress him.

284
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,910
毕竟他备受瞩目  还是明星运动员
He--he was popular, a star athlete.

285
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,180
于是她就跟他喝了点啤酒
So she had a couple beers with him,

286
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,840
她说他在酒里下了药
Claimed he slipped something in her drink.

287
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,800
那他为什么没被拘捕
Why wasn't he arrested?

288
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,730
她等了两天才报的案
She waited two days to report the assault.

289
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,290
估计是又羞又怕
Probably ashamed, scared.

290
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,000
毒物检验报告显示正常  强奸罪名不成立
Tox reports came back clean. Rape kit was inconclusive.

291
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,280
她放弃了指控
She dropped the charges.

292
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,700
那女孩子是谁
Who was the girl?

293
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,110
加百列・提尔曼  医生的姐姐
Gabrielle Tillman, the doctor's sister.

294
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,230
事情发生一年后  加百列被送进了急诊室
A year after the attack, Gabrielle was rushed to the E.R.

295
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,250
结果送到时候已经没救了
And pronounced D.O.A.

296
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,450
死因是服用抗焦虑药物
From an overdose of antidepressants

297
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,010
和安眠药过量
And sleeping pills.

298
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,270
这可不是什么偶然过量
This isn't an accidental overdose.

299
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,520
这是
This is--

300
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,310
她自杀了
She committed suicide.

301
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,810
所以机器给出了提尔曼的号码
And that's why the machine gave us Tillman's number.

302
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,250
她要杀了本顿
She's going to murder Benton.

303
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,640
那个害死她姐姐的男人
The man responsible for her sister's death.

304
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,690
正解
Correct.

305
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,690
芬奇  她是个悬壶济世的医生
Finch, she's a doctor who saves lives.

306
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,590
她如何能懂杀人是怎么回事情
She doesn't know what it's like to take one.

307
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,660
这会毁了她
It'll destroy her.

308
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,550
伯戴特先生  我是卡特警探
Mr. Burdett? Detective carter.

309
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,740
我之前跟你通过电话  关于那宗您目击的劫案
I called regarding the robbery you witnessed.

310
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,980
我能进去么
Uh, can I come in?

311
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,110
我在等你来
I've been expecting you.

312
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,790
不好意思有点乱
Sorry about the mess.

313
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,210
律师助理是吧
Paralegal, right?

314
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,220
在证物保管处查案子
At lockup looking into a case?

315
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,740
遗嘱认证法庭无法使
Probate court failed to require

316
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,270
执行人出示一份高保债券
A fidelity bond of the executor.

317
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,280
执行人所做的
The executor, in his turn,

318
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,960
则是把奥曼房产刨了个精光
Robbed the Ulman Estate blind.

319
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,310
-请坐  -谢谢
 - Please sit. - Oh, thank you.

320
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,290
你是在此次劫案当中受的伤么
Were you injured during the robbery?

321
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,610
别担心  我不会起诉市政府的
Don't worry. I'm not gonna sue the city.

322
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,830
是旧伤了
This is an old injury,

323
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,960
尽管这事也没给我什么好处
Although the stress of the situation did not help.

324
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,110
我们在竭尽所能抓捕犯人
We're doing everything in our power to catch these guys.

325
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,480
伯戴特先生  介不介意我再请你回顾下当时的情况
Mr. Burdett, do you mind walking me through what happened?

326
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,560
我就在保管处的前台站着
I was standing at the counter at lockup.

327
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,220
然后他们就冲进来了  他们有枪
They came storming in. They had guns.

328
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,400
他们高喊要我们趴下贴地  于是
They were shouting at us to get down on the floor, so...

329
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,930
我照办了
I did.

330
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
抢劫过程中
During the robbery,

331
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,240
你有没有听到有人说  以利亚  这个名字
Did you hear any of the men say the name "Elias"?

332
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,850
应该没有  谁是以利亚
I don't believe so. Who's Elias?

333
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,410
你有没有看到他们的长相
Did you get a look at any of their faces?

334
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,210
没
No.

335
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,260
他们当中有没有人跟你说话
Did any of the men talk to you?

336
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,710
我不记得有
Not that I recall.

337
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,290
可是在我看来
Because it looks to me...

338
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,270
这个人跟你讲了些话
Like this man said something to you.

339
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,530
我还希望我别再被问一次这个事情
Oh, I was hoping I wouldn't have to go

340
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,020
没完没了的
Through all of this again.

341
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,620
是
Yes.

342
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,100
他跟我说叫我别再盯着他看
He told me to stop staring at him.

343
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,540
有意思
That's interesting.

344
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,430
大多数人的反应都是转开视线
Most people's instinct is to look away.

345
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,080
倒是从来没人说我跟大多数人一样
Well, I've never been accused of being like most people.

346
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,740
他还有跟你说了些什么吗
Did he say anything else to you?

347
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,300
没
No.

348
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,530
你有没有用各种方式与他交流过
Did you try to communicate with him in any other way?

349
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,380
此话怎讲
How do you mean?

350
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,580
当他抓着你的外套拎着你的时候
When he was holding you by your jacket.

351
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,750
我叫他放了我
I asked him to let me go.

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,580
你就说了那些话
And that's all you said?

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,900
卡特警探
Detective carter,

354
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,760
我想你应该是习惯于枪口下来去了
I suppose you're used to being around guns,

355
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,020
我想暴力犯罪的场景对你来说并不陌生
I suppose scenes of violence are commonplace for you,

356
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,920
但是我能向你保证  与我而言  十分恐怖
But I can assure you that for me, it was terrifying.

357
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,240
我当时怕极了  连眼珠子都不会转了
I was so terrified, I couldn't even look away.

358
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,200
所以  当他把我抓起来的时候
So, when he picked me up,

359
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,790
我以为我是死定了
I thought surely I was about to die.

360
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,390
所以  是  我是跟他沟通了
So, yes, I was communicating with him.

361
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,220
我是求他放过我
I was begging for my life.

362
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,060
很抱歉当时我具体说了什么话记不起来了
I'm sorry I can't remember the exact words I used.

363
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,250
那
Well...

364
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,180
如果你还能再想起来些什么  请给我电话
If you can think of anything else, please give me a call.

365
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,660
向你保证  我们一定会抓住他们
I promise you, we will catch this guy.

366
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,840
提尔曼在哪  里瑟先生
Where's Tillman, Mr. Reese?

367
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,240
她在上班
She's working.

368
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,010
而我正在处理我的副业
I'm taking care of a little side project.

369
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,080
怎么心神不宁的啊  哈罗德
What's got you worried, Harold?

370
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,320
卡特警探
Detective Carter.

371
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,820
我跟她见面谈了下抢劫的事情
I met with her about the robbery.

372
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,260
我必须得摸摸她的底
I had to know what she knows.

373
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,490
她很有干劲
She's motivated.

374
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,190
按某人话说叫  执着
Some might say "Fixated."

375
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,160
很快她就能追查到你身上了
It won't be long before she catches up to you.

376
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,100
还是早做打算为妙
Gonna have to have a plan when she does.

377
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,630
交给我去解决
I'm taking care of it.

378
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,930
我正在结交一位新朋友  
I'm making a new friend on the police force.

379
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,310
他会帮忙解决卡特与弗斯科问题
He's going to help us with our problem with Carter and Fusco.

380
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,040
提尔曼20分钟后下班
Tillman's off in 20 minutes.

381
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,540
撤了
Got to go.

382
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,510
从酒吧出来  我们就去了他家
After the bar, we went back to his place.

383
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,580
他在我的饮料里掺了东西
He slipped something in my drink.

384
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,350
我就昏迷了
I blacked out.

385
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,220
当我
When I...

386
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,960
醒来的时候  我趴在他床上  全裸
Woke up, I was in his bed, facedown, naked.

387
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,730
我找不到我的衣服
I couldn't find my dress.

388
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,570
我想喊
I wanted to scream,

389
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,570
叫警察
To call the cops,

390
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,800
或者别的任何人
Someone, anyone,

391
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,500
但是我害怕
But I was afraid.

392
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,640
我哭着走了
I was crying when I left.

393
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,650
他只是笑着  还说我真是够狂野
He just smiled and said I was a real wild woman,

394
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,550
还说我们上班时再见
And he would see me at work.

395
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,190
现在每天我看到他  他脸上都是同一个笑容
Now every day I see him, and he smiles that same smile,

396
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,930
我就很想吐
And I want to throw up.

397
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,360
可我需要这份工  我不能辞职
I need this job. I can't quit.

398
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,600
这种事我也说不出口
I never talk at these things either.

399
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,270
-请问你说什么  -对不起
 - Excuse me? - Oh, I'm sorry.

400
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,040
我只是自言自语
I didn't mean to interrupt. I...

401
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,860
我只是来弄点咖啡
Just wanted some coffee.

402
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,150
不好意思
Sorry.

403
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,790
没事  我今天是第三杯了
Son't be. It's my third cup today.

404
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,480
我一直以来参加这种活动  想让自己好受点
You know, I keep coming to these things, hoping I'll feel better,

405
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,940
但是只会让我更难受
But they only make me feel worse.

406
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,760
这咖啡真难喝
This coffee's terrible.

407
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,170
里面那个女人  你认识她吗
Uh, that woman in there-- y-you know her?

408
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,730
不
No.

409
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,500
只是  我认识像她那样的人
But, uh, I know someone like her.

410
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,010
你呢
What about you? - hmm?

411
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,180
你为什么来这
Why are you here?

412
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,440
我失去了一个很亲近的人
I lost someone very close to me.

413
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,150
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,990
我无时无刻不在回想
Not a day goes by I don't think

415
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,320
我当时能做什么好挽回这一切
About what I could've done.

416
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,820
是啊
Yeah.

417
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:59,650
很多年后我才明白我朋友到底出了什么事
It took me years to piece together what happened to my friend.

418
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,370
我说  我觉得我能
You know, I thought I could...

419
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,370
挺过去
Live with it.

420
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,110
我终究放下了
I put it behind me.

421
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,840
我有份好工作
I had a good job,

422
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,450
美好人生
A good life.

423
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,380
然后我在一个月前看到了他
And then I saw him a month ago.

424
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,050
于是一切又都回来了
And it all came back.

425
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,460
他那时在吃晚饭
He was eating dinner

426
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,560
就在我家附近的一间法国小餐馆
At this little french place in my neighborhood.

427
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,990
他在约会
He was out on a date.

428
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,210
他看起来相当志得意满
He looked content.

429
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,910
我的世界支离破碎  而他却志得意满
My world is shattered, and he looks content.

430
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,670
抱歉
Sorry.

431
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,370
我不知道怎么就和你说起这些来了
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

432
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,080
人总得找个人聊聊
Hey, everybody needs someone to talk to.

433
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,140
我叫约翰
I'm John.

434
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,350
我叫凯特  凯特・莱曼
I'm Kate. Kate Leman.

435
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,060
这些照片是那个变态的奖杯吗
The photos are some kind of sick trophies of his victims.

436
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,090
说服了这些女人跟他一起吸毒
Benton convinces these women to do coke with him,

437
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,260
偷偷对她们用镇定剂  然后再强奸
Slips them a sedative, then rapes them.

438
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,570
到了早上  她们就怕地不敢再出面
In the morning, they're too afraid to come forward

439
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,530
而且还把自己搭进去了
And implicate themselves.

440
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,340
我想这就能解释为什么
I suppose that explains

441
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,080
这些针对他的指控一直都主动撤销了
Why the charges against him are consistently dropped.

442
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,910
这人够堕落
The guy's depraved...

443
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,510
最喜欢侵犯和羞辱这些女人
Gets off on violating and humiliating all these women.

444
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,280
他不会罢手  芬奇
He's not gonna stop, finch.

445
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,390
那医生给我的假名你查到什么有用的吗
Did you get a hit on that name the doctor gave me?

446
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,620
我找到三个凯特・莱曼
We got three hits on Kate Leman--

447
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,920
就是她给本顿的那个假名
The same pseudonym she gave to Benton.

448
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,130
第一个是住在布隆克斯的80岁老太太
The first is an 80-year-old woman living in the Bronx.

449
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,390
第二个住在上城区
The second is living upstate

450
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
女子劳教所
At a woman's corrections facility.

451
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,920
第三个有个邮箱
The third has a P.O. Box

452
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,010
就开在离提尔曼工作的医院一条街的地方
A block from Tillman's hospital.

453
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,940
她最近租了一辆面包车
She recently signed rental agreements for a van

454
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,140
和蒙特卡的一个度假屋
And a vacation home in Montauk.

455
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,130
你找到那房子了吗
You find the house?

456
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,970
还有些别的东西
And then some.

457
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,340
医生有用来彻底抹杀掉本顿的东西
Doctor has everything she needs to erase Benton for good.

458
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,540
你说的抹杀是什么意思
What do you mean "Erase?"

459
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,980
八磅碱  加热到300华氏度
8 pounds of lye, heated to 300 degrees--

460
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,480
尸体三个小时便无影无踪
Body will dissolve in three hours,

461
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,580
大约这个数
Give or take.

462
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,520
我就不问你是怎么知道的了
I will refrain from asking how you know that.

463
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,790
芬奇  她做事极为细致
Oh, Finch, she's meticulous--

464
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,320
策划所有这一切都是为了报仇
Planned everything to a "T,"

465
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,130
并且她会逍遥法外
And she's gonna get away with it.

466
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,530
我都忍不住要这么想
I'm beginning to wonder

467
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,460
她这么做是不是帮了这个世界一个忙
If maybe she's not doing the world a favor.

468
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,860
但提尔曼不是个杀手
But Tillman isn't a killer.

469
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,000
她要是这么做了  会毁了她的一生
She goes through with it, it'll ruin her life.

470
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
你有什么建议  里瑟先生
What do you suggest, mr. Reese?

471
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,600
我们不给她机会下手
We don't give her the chance.

472
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,910
我会想办法让本顿消失
I'm gonna find a way to make Benton disappear.

473
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,160
决定帮我了吗
Decided to help me?

474
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,200
我还是难以替代的哈
I'm not so easy to replace, huh?

475
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,070
我警告你  这些毒贩会从背后偷袭你
I'm warning you, these Cartel guys will put two in your back,

476
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,110
所以别给他们还手的机会
So don't leave any of them standing.

477
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,310
你要不要我...你真的不要我
You need me here-- you sure you don't want me

478
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,880
到后面去守着出口吗
to go around back and cover the exits?

479
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,210
不用  你在这就好
No, you're good right here.

480
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,950
警探
Detective?

481
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,920
钱拿来了吗
You got our money?

482
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,720
奥拉尔  圭埃尔
Orale, Guey.

483
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,880
你应该杀了他们
You're supposed to take them out.

484
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,120
你做什么  你偷他们的货吗
Hey, what are you doing? You stealing from them?

485
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,650
如果这能安慰你下  这是为了做好事
If it makes you feel better, it's for a good cause.

486
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,960
先生  麻烦一下
Sir, pardon me.

487
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,500
有什么问题
What's the problem?

488
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,100
没问题
No problem.

489
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,460
先生  你能听到吗
Sir, can you hear me?

490
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,900
我和你说  这一周真是太劲爆了
I'm telling you, this has been the craziest week.

491
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,790
我请你们喝酒
Drinks are on me.

492
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,800
他被放了
He's being released.

493
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,710
为什么
Why?

494
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,980
看那家伙  他有四个律师
Look at the guy. He's got four lawyers.

495
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,150
每个人身上的西装
Each of them got a suit on

496
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,710
比我半年的工资还贵
that costs more than I make in six months--

497
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,280
这种律师对法律的每个漏洞都一清二楚
The kind of lawyers that know every loophole

498
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,460
可以让像本顿这样的败类逃脱制裁
a piece of garbage like Benton can crawl through.

499
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,050
斗牛帮怎么办
What about the Toreros?

500
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,690
现在他们不仅要找我  还要找他们的货
They're gonna come looking for me and their coke.

501
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,710
那最好别让他们找到你  莱奈尔
Well, we better make sure they don't find you, Lionel.

502
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,960
你知道你给我惹了什么麻烦吗
You know what kind of hole you got me into?

503
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,730
我到底是在犹豫什么啊  干嘛不直接
What's stopping me right now from making some noise,

504
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,900
把你供出去得了
getting you arrested?

505
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,800
不知道哎  你在犹豫什么咧
I don't know. What's stopping you?

506
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,830
是我
It's me.

507
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,330
我知道已经晚了
I know it's late.

508
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,320
这是我的错
It was my fault.

509
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,120
我现在懂了
I know that now.

510
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,990
我想要忘记这一切  但我做不到
I tried to put it out of my head, but I can't.

511
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,780
对不起  小梅
I'm sorry, Meg.

512
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,430
我不是个好姐姐
I should've been a better sister.

513
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
求你
Please...

514
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,400
忘了我的电话
Just forget I called.

515
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,840
忘了这一切
Forget all this.

516
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,010
里瑟  提尔曼医生有动作了
Reese, dr. Tillman's on the move.

517
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,150
她不是在值班吗
I thought she was in the middle of a shift.

518
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,960
之前是
She was.

519
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,400
但她去休息了  还告诉护士
She went to take a nap and told the nurse

520
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,280
不要叫醒她
not to wake her.

521
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,460
现在她离开医院了
Now she's moving away from the hospital.

522
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,430
交给我
I'm on it.

523
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,130
不管你要做什么  要尽快
Whatever you do, do it quick.

524
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,830
她朝本顿的家里去了
She's headed toward Benton's loft.

525
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,970
好吧  明白
All right, got it.

526
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,210
伙计们  你们能晚点再来吗  我有点忙...
Can we do this later, fellas? I'm a little bus--

527
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,260
搞什么
What the hell?

528
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,610
里瑟  医生在本顿家已经有五分钟了
Reese, the doctor's been at Benton's loft for five minutes.

529
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,310
你到底死哪去了
Where the hell are you?

530
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,440
再见到你真好  莱奈尔
Nice to see you again, Lionel.

531
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,210
弗斯科警探欠我们一笔帐
Detective Fusco owes us a debt...

532
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,610
所以他拿了点东西来还债
So he made a little down payment--

533
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
就是你
You.

534
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,930
这算双赢
It's a win-win.

535
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,260
我们的毒品呢
Where's our cocaine?

536
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,070
我知道你
I know you.

537
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,970
那你肯定也知道要是招惹了斗牛帮
Then you know if you cross the Torero Cartel,

538
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,670
你就得准备掉脑袋
You lose your head.

539
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,240
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,350
现在道歉太晚了  伙计
It's too late to apologize, amigo.

541
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,880
不  我抱歉
No, I'm sorry...

542
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,880
是因为要掉脑袋的人是你
But you're gonna lose your head...

543
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,530
要是你老大发现

544
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,490
你一直在和你们的对头海湾帮卖命

545
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,650
杀了你老大的手下

546
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,830
还有他儿子

547
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,970
这是真的吗
Is this true?

548
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,670
闭嘴
Shut up.

549
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,400
那他怎么知道米盖尔的事
How does he know about Miguel?

550
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,870
闭嘴  他在说谎
Shut up. He's lying.

551
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,870
要是让我再看到你

552
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,870
你就准备掉脑袋吧

553
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,500
听着  这不是针对你  好吗
Look, it was nothing personal, all right?

554
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,300
我也没办法  他们要杀了我
I had no choice. They were gonna kill me.

555
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,170
我说了  你不是纽约唯一的腐败条子
I told you, you're not the only dirty cop in town.

556
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,680
我帮了你的忙
I called in a favor.

557
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,580
现在该换换了
It's time for a change of scenery.

558
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,480
你得替我做点其他事
You're gonna be doing something else for me.

559
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
还有  莱奈尔
And, Lionel...

560
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,550
下不为例
Don't do this again.

561
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,950
警官
Officer.

562
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,620
-请给我加二十块二号油  -当然
- Uh, $20 on 2, please. - Sure.

563
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,080
谢谢
Thanks.

564
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,550
我就猜是你
I thought that was you.

565
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,690
还记得我吗
Remember me?

566
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,660
你是互助小组的那个人
Oh! The guy from the support group.

567
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,970
好吧
Yeah.

568
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,130
我得走了
Well, I got to go.

569
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,370
让我请你喝杯咖啡吧  梅根
Let me buy you a cup of coffee, Megan.

570
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,610
得了  我知道这感觉很糟
Come on, I hear it's terrible.

571
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,910
你车里的那个被绑着的男人可以等等
The guy you got tied up in the back of the van can wait.

572
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,790
你很聪明
You're smart.

573
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,130
你也一直很小心
And you've been careful.

574
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,070
你应该不会被抓到
You probably wouldn't get caught.

575
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,010
但事实是  你永远也摆脱不了这件事
But the truth is, you'll never really get away with it.

576
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,350
你知道他是什么人
Do you know who he is...

577
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,820
他都做了什么吗
What he's done?

578
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,180
我知道所有安德鲁・本顿的事
I know all about Andrew Benton.

579
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,940
还有你  梅根
I know all about you, Megan.

580
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,890
我知道你是个很棒的医生
I know you're a damn good doctor.

581
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,460
我知道你的一生
I know that you've spent years of your life

582
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,090
都在治病救人
healing people.

583
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,830
我也知道如果你这么做了
And I know if you do this...

584
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,200
如果你冷血地杀死了那个男人
If you murder this man in cold blood...

585
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,180
你就会被吞噬
It will kill you.

586
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,080
你说你失去了重要的人
You told me that you lost someone.

587
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,950
这是真的吗
Was that true?

588
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,690
那你怎么能就这么让我袖手旁观
How can you sit there and tell me not to do something

589
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,430
你也知道你内心告诉你该怎么做吧
You know in your heart you would do, too?

590
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,400
因为我和你不同
Because unlike you...

591
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,620
我知道当你夺走别人的生命时
I know what happens when you take a life.

592
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,930
你自己生命的一部分也失去了
You lose a part of yourself...

593
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,670
不是所有的部分
Not everything...

594
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,340
只是最重要的部分
Just the part that matters the most.

595
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,040
你就是这样的吗
Is that what happened to you?

596
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,820
你不用非得这么做
You don't have to do this.

597
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,820
你现在还可以回头
You can turn around right now.

598
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,760
他看到我了  他看到了我的样子
He's seen me. He's seen my face.

599
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,560
我想我能和他聊聊
Well, suppose I have a little talk with him.

600
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,870
相信我  这不要紧
Trust me, it won't matter.

601
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,900
把你的车钥匙给我  梅根
Give me the keys to your van, Megan.

602
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,980
他做了这么多事
Everything he's done,

603
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,480
我只要把钥匙给你就行了吗

604
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
他就这么逍遥法外

她有对你的美好回忆
She gets to keep her memory of you.

611
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,910
我不明白
I don't get it.

00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,810
你是谁  你为什么要来
Who are you? Why are you here?

我告诉过你了
I already told you.

你为什么这么做  芬奇

624
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,630
这个机器  这些号码  所有这些事

省省吧
Save it.

632
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,730
有人叫我把你调到这来  还不要问理由
I was told to assign you to this desk and not ask questions.

633
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,070
所以我不问为什么
So this is me not asking questions.

634
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,940
那你也打电话给你的朋友
And this is you calling your friend

635

让他处理掉他拍的我的照片

我可不会在意你背后有什么人

我会亲自把你踢出去

我家里有个女人...她
That woman in my loft-- she...

650
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,380
她把我电晕了
Tased me.

651
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,180
别担心  我让她走了
Don't worry. I told her to leave.

652
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,180
她不是做这种事的人
She isn't cut out for this.

653
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,820
她是救人的人
She fixes people...

654
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,290
不像我们
Not like us.

655
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,090
我们是毁了他们的人
We break them.

656
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,630
我不懂  你是谁
I don't understand. Um, who are you?

657
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,340
你要把我怎么样
What are you gonna do to me?

658
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,440
说实话  我还没决定
Honestly, I haven't decided yet.

659
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,130
我问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

660
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,920
你觉得人真的会改变吗
Do you think people ever really change?

661
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,190
我是说  你伤害无辜的人
I mean, you-- you hurt innocent people,

662
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,120
而我
And I-- well...

663
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,830
很久以来  我就负责杀你这种人
For a long time, I killed people like you.

664
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,330
求你了  我不是你想的那种人
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

665
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,870
你搞错了
This is a mistake.

666
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,270
等等  好吧
Wait--wait, o-o-okay.

667
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,010
我是做过一些事
I've done some things. Um...

668
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,280
一些越轨的事
I've crossed some lines.

669
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,780
但我不会再做了
But I won't do it again.

670
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,110
我发誓
I-I swear.

671
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,450
求你了
Please...

672
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,120
放我走
Let me go.

673
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,660
我可以放你走
I could let you go,

674
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,230
因为你要知道  你之后的日子
'cause you know for the rest of your life

675
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,970
我都会监视着你
That I'd be watching you.

676
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,270
如果你再敢伤害任何人
And if you hurt anybody...

677
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,700
我会阻止你
I'd stop you.

678
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,920
也许你可以改变
Maybe you could change.

679
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,380
也许我也可以
And maybe so could I.

680
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,150
但事实是
But the truth is...

681
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,890
人们的本性难移是吧
People don't really change, do they?

682
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,730
不  他们可以改变
No, they, uh-- they can.

683
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,630
我可以
I can.

684
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,860
而你...
And, um, you--

685
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,430
我
I--

686
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,640
我觉得你不会杀我
I don't think that you're going to kill me.

687
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,970
-是吗  -是的  因为...
- No? - No, because...

688
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,140
我能看到你内心...
I can see, inside, that you're a--

689
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,240
是个好人
A good person.

690
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,650
你是个好人
You're a good man.

691
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,780
好人
Good?

692
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,050
很早以前  我已经失去好的部分了
I lost that part of myself a long time ago.

693
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,160
我不知道我还能不能重新找回来
I'm not sure if I can find it.

694
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,650
这对我来说还重不重要
I'm not sure it matters anymore.

695
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,170
也许这样更好
Maybe it's better this way.

696
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,340
也许我就该去做好人做不了的事
Maybe it's up to me to do what the good people can't.

697
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,070
也许这世上已经没有好人了
Or maybe there are no good people.

698
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,750
也许这才是唯一正确的决定
Maybe there are only good decisions.

699
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,410
求你了
Please...

700
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,080
你...
You--

701
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,620
别做出你会后悔的事情
Y-you don't want to do something that you're gonna regret.

702
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,260
你觉得什么会让我更后悔
Which do you think I'll regret more--

703
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,210
是放了你
Letting you live

704
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,260
还是杀了你
Or letting you die?

705
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,210
安德鲁
Andrew...

706
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,540
帮我做出正确的决定吧
Help me make a good decision.
