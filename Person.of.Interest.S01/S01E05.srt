2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,040
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,980
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,180
一台机器
A machine.

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,870
每时每刻都在监视你
It spies on you every hour of every day.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,790
我知道  因为它是我造的
I know because I built it.

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,280
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖行动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,060
但它却看到了一切
But it sees everything.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,920
与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,150
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,190
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,660
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act so I decided I would.

13
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,230
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner.

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,740
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,920
因为被当局追捕
Hunted by the authorities,

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,190
我们只能秘密行事
We work in secret.

17
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,890
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,160
不管你是被害人和行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,530
如果你的号码被列出来
If your number's up,

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,130
我们就会找到你
We'll find you.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,400
是我
Yeah?

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,870
有麻烦了
We've got a problem.

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,130
这儿什么好吃
What's good here?

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,520
这没用  里瑟先生
That won't work, Mr. Reese.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,400
什么没用
What won't?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,640
你提问的方式
Your interrogation technique.

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,980
这儿什么好吃
What's good here?

28
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,250
我就单纯地问个问题
It's an innocent question.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,510
你什么时候单纯过
No question is ever innocent from you.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,260
你是想判断我是不是这里的常客
You're trying to determine whether I come here often.

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,370
然后再根据这点
Armed with that knowledge,

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,270
查出我的住处
you'll try to figure out where I live.

33
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,100
芬奇  你太多疑了
You're paranoid, Finch.

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,460
我多疑不是没道理
With good reason.

35
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,930
也许我就是不清楚这家店什么好吃
Maybe I just don't know what's good here

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,980
所以才随便问问
So I'm asking the regular.

37
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,710
好好吃饭吧  里瑟先生
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Reese.

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,560
萨缪尔・盖茨
Samuel Gates.

39
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,100
你名单上的下一个号码
The next number on your list.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,270
校车来了
Bus is here!

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,280
我们知道他什么情况
So what do we have on him?

42
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,630
生于南波士顿
Born in south Boston.

43
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,160
纽约大学法学学位
Law degree from NYU.

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,270
和他儿子萨姆住在上西区
He lives on the upper west side with his son, Sam.

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,730
他老婆呢
Where's the wife?

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,820
去年去世了
She died last year.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,750
和盖茨有关吗
Any chance Gates was involved?

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,960
除非他能让老婆患上癌症
Not unless he found a way to give her cancer.

49
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,640
伊丽莎白・盖茨去年四月
Elizabeth Gates was diagnosed

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
被确诊为脑瘤  无法手术
with an inoperable brain tumor last April.

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,500
十一月就离世了
By November she was gone.

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,200
那他就剩这个宝贝儿子了
So the son is all he has left.

53
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,110
-等等  -差点忘了午餐
- Wait! - Oh, don't forget your lunch.

54
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,610
保姆那边什么情况
What do we know about the nanny?

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,600
克里斯蒂娜・罗哈斯
Christina Rojas.

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,160
盖茨在老婆患病时就雇了她
Gates hired her when his wife fell ill.

57
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,550
小家伙很喜欢她
The kid sure likes her.

58
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,360
她没少陪这孩子
She spends a lot of time with him.

59
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,930
根据她的收费钟点看
Judging by the hours she's billing,

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,450
盖茨多数时间都在办公室
I'd say Gates was putting in long days at the office.

61
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,170
爱妻离世
He lost the woman he loved.

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,870
他大概想借工作摆脱痛苦
Probably threw himself into his work to cope.

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,570
他办公室在哪儿
Where's his office?

64
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,210
纽约刑事法院
Criminal court, city of New York.

65
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,790
也许就是因为这点
Which may explain why the machine

66
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,660
机器才报出他的社保号码
has sent us his social.

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,520
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,940
这是合法获取的直接证据
This is direct evidence, properly obtained.

69
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,790
所以他应该是目标  而非嫌犯
So odds are he's the victim, not the perpetrator.

70
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,610
法官常受死亡威胁
Judges get plenty of death threats.

71
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,710
法官大人  这个录像不符合均衡原则
It doesn't pass the balancing test, your honor.

72
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,050
其证明效力...
The probative value is--

73
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,040
我知道什么是均衡原则  律师先生
I know what the balancing test is, counselor.

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,050
盖茨比常人遭遇更多死亡威胁
Gates gets more death threats than most.

75
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,210
换句官话就是
Word at the courthouse is

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,050
他以一己之力向罪恶展开战争
He's waging a one-man war on crime--

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,960
强硬  一丝不苟  树敌无数
Tough, by-the-book, making lots of enemies.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,270
如果案发现场的视频也有不公平的偏见
If video of the actual crime is unfairly prejudicial,

79
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,140
那恐怕我们就得摒弃
I think we might have to give up

80
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,230
整个陪审团机制了
on the entire concept of trial by jury.

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,980
视频资料有效
The video's in.

82
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,170
每个人都有敌人
Everyone has enemies.

83
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,380
机器会选出恶意和伤害的预谋
The machine identifies malice and an intent to harm.

84
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,110
我们得判断究竟是什么威胁
We need to determine which threat it saw,

85
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,770
哪一个才是真的威胁
Which one is real.

86
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,890
在搞清情况前
Until we know,

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,880
最好的办法就是盯紧盖茨
my best bet is to stay close to Gates,

88
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,040
以防被人占了先机
In case somebody makes a move.

89
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,070
看来他的敌人真是不少
Looks like he's got quite a collection of enemies.

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,060
里瑟先生  有威胁迹象吗
Mr. Reese, any sign of a threat?

91
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,180
胆固醇算吗
Does cholesterol count?

92
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,760
恐吓信基本分析完了
I'm nearly done analyzing the threatening letters.

93
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,880
还有九封查不到来源
There are nine that I still can't source,

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,020
不过找到六个可疑嫌犯
But I've identified six possible suspects.

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,610
里面有留平头的白人吗
Any of them white guys with crew cuts?

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,170
没注意到
Not that I'm aware of.

97
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,170
庭审中  放心  [9分钟前发送]

98
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,960
已放学  行动  [6分钟前接收]

99
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,850
芬奇  那孩子叫什么来着
Finch, what's the son's name again?

100
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,640
小萨缪尔・盖茨
Samuel Gates, Junior.

101
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
怎么了
Why?

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,930
我看我们跟错了萨缪尔・盖茨
I think we've been following the wrong Sam Gates.

103
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,340
克里斯蒂娜
Hey, Christina.

104
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,160
你肯定不相信
You're not going to believe

105
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,500
马克今天对盖泽尔老师说什么了
what Mark C. Said to Mrs. Kizer today.

106
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,050
靠错误的信息我可没法准时赶到
I can't be there on time if I'm getting bad information.

107
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,110
机器跳出的号码不会错
The machine did not send us the wrong number.

108
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,560
盖茨法官肯定有危险
If it says that judge Gates is in danger, then he is.

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,110
那他的儿子呢
Well, tell that to his son.

110
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,640
绑架必定与此有关
The kidnapping must connect.

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,240
可能这是他们阴谋的一部分
It could be the first step in a larger plot

112
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,820
最终以法官被害收场
That ends with the judge dead.

113
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,800
我们还是可以阻止这一切
We can still put a stop to it, all of it.

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,090
只是需要个计划
But we need a plan.

115
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,440
计划我有
I have a plan.

116
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,030
找到萨姆
Find Sam.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,210
法官刚死了老婆
The man just lost his wife.

118
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,160
不能再让他孤寂而终
I won't let him wind up alone.

119
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,650
盖茨法官
Judge Gates.

120
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,890
-爸爸  -萨姆
- Dad? - Hey, Sam.

121
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,010
爸爸...
Dad...

122
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,390
怎么了
What's wrong?

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,630
他很好  法官大人  眼下还好
He's fine, your honor... for now.

124
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,730
你是谁
Who are you?

125
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,100
我儿子在哪儿
Where is my son?

126
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,840
不许报警
No cops, no feds.

127
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,800
说出去他就死定了
Tell anyone and he's dead.

128
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,180
老实等着  晚上会给你电话
Keep quiet and you'll hear from us tonight.

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,550
等等  听着  我们可以解决这事
Wait, look... we can handle this ourselves.

130
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
想要什么只管说
Just tell me what you want.

131
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,690
我是萨姆  留言吧
This is Sam, leave a message.

132
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,740
克里斯蒂娜  我是盖茨法官
Hi, uh, Christina, this is Judge Gates.

133
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,940
求你回个电话
Please! Call me back.

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,970
你好  我是盖茨法官  萨姆和丹尼尔在你那吗
Hi, uh, this is Judge Gates. Is Sam there with Daniel?

135
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,600
没啊  怎么了
No, is everything okay?

136
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,860
上帝啊
Oh, god.

137
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,890
我们想办法把你儿子找回来
Let's figure out how we get your son back.

138
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,910
你是谁
Who are you?

139
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,860
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

140
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,650
萨姆在哪儿
Where is Sam?

141
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,960
我儿子在哪儿
Where is my son?

142
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,700
你和劫匪一伙的吧
You're with the kidnappers, aren't you?

143
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,570
你是他们的人
You're one of them.

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,850
不  我试过阻止他们
No, I tried to stop them.

145
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,880
不过劫匪联系你了
But the kidnappers made contact.

146
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,030
这很好
That's good.

147
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,120
就是说他们想谈判
That means they want to negotiate.

148
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,110
只要你儿子有价值  他们就不会伤害他
They won't hurt your son as long as he's worth something.

149
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,280
你试过阻止他们  是什么意思
What do you mean, you tried to stop them?

150
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,300
你当时在场吗
You were there?

151
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,340
是的
I was.

152
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,700
只可惜到晚了
But not soon enough.

153
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,660
你怎么就知道他们要绑架我儿子
How did you know they were going to take him?

154
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,130
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

155
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,100
现在你有两个问题要问
You have two questions right now:

156
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,280
"你是谁"  "我儿子在哪儿"
Who are you and where is my son?

157
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,230
你觉得哪个比较重要
Which one do you want to focus on?

158
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,930
他们来过我家
They were in my house.

159
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,250
他们怎么避过警报装置
How'd they get past the alarm?

160
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,710
我监听了你的电话
I've tapped your phone

161
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,050
现在你家门前的街上装个监控
and I'm setting up surveillance on your street.

162
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,290
这是搞清劫匪身份的最好方法
It's our best shot at IDing the kidnappers.

163
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,560
克里斯蒂娜哪儿去了
Where's Christina?

164
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,490
我儿子放学后她就该在
She was supposed to be here when he got home.

165
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,850
我没看到她
I didn't see her.

166
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,750
她可能是内鬼吗
Could she be in on it?

167
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,700
不可能
That's impossible.

168
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,940
她爱萨姆
She loved Sam.

169
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,110
法官...
Judge...

170
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,540
你受到过绑架威胁吗
Have you received any kidnapping threats?

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,350
或者判过涉及绑匪的案子
Tried any cases involving kidnappers?

172
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,900
我银行里有30万
I have about $300,000 in the bank.

173
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,120
要是他们要钱  我可以出
If this is about money, I can pay.

174
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,560
不管他们什么企图  我都会找到你儿子
Whatever this is about, I'm going to find your son.

175
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,830
把他带回家
And I'm going to bring him home.

176
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,880
在这待着  等下个电话
Stay here and wait for the next call.

177
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,070
他们说了  不许报警
They said no cops, no FBI.

178
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,090
可他们没说不能找我
They didn't say anything about me.

179
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,770
好吧  芬奇
Okay, Finch.

180
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,730
盖茨电话的音频和家门口
You should have audio on his landline

181
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,150
大街的视频你应该有了
and video of the street outside Gates' house.

182
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,890
和你一样  我也想救那孩子
I want to save that boy as much as you do,

183
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,650
可你记住  里瑟先生
but remember, Mr. Reese--

184
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,810
我们不能让一个法官问及
We don't need a judge asking questions

185
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,660
我们是谁  我们做的事情
about who we are and what we do.

186
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,220
眼皮底下的绑架我都搞不定
I can't work a kidnapping from arm's length.

187
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,250
等我把萨姆找回来  再担心盖茨的事吧
I'll worry about Gates once we get Sam back.

188
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,650
绑匪那边有什么情况吗
Where are we on the kidnappers?

189
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,200
那个电话有查到什么吗
Any luck tracing their call?

190
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,430
恐怕没有
I'm afraid not.

191
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,760
那个IP地址是网络上的匿名旁白
It was voice-over I.P., anonymized through the internet.

192
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,840
那另一个电话呢
what about the other phone?

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,490
被盯梢的扔进垃圾桶的那个
The one the spotter threw in the trash?

194
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,600
显然是一次性电话
it's a disposable, obviously.

195
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,370
记忆卡上查不到什么
Not much on the sim card.

196
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,880
只有些电话记录和短信息
Some disconnected numbers and a handful of texts,

197
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,500
但都设了密码
All equally cryptic.

198
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,870
所以我准备黑进到电话公司
So I'm trying to hack the cell company

199
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,230
进一步查找信息
For more information.

200
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,230
但他们的防火墙太难攻破了
But their firewall is impressive.

201
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,640
居然能难倒你
you can't get in?

202
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,300
你不是造了监视整个国家的机器吗
You built a machine that spies on the entire country.

203
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,780
当时为政府工作
when you work for the government,

204
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,700
权限当然不成问题
Access is not a problem.

205
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,170
今非昔比好吗
Things are different now.

206
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,090
我想办法搞定
I'll figure it out.

207
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,630
那就快点搞定
Well, figure it out quick.

208
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,410
绑匪还杀死了保姆
The kidnappers killed the nanny.

209
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,200
他们一定是逼她说出了防盗门的密码
They must have gotten Gates' alarm code out of her.

210
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,150
911  请问有什么紧急情况  喂
911 emergency, hello?

211
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,280
-看到卡特了吗  -没有 
- Hey, you seen Carter? - No.

212
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,310
你好
Detective.

213
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,140
好
Detective.

214
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,470
弗斯科  你是从51区调过来的吧  
You came down from the 51st right, Fusco?

215
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,400
布朗克斯分局
The Bronx finest.

216
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,930
怎么想到来这
What brought you here?

217
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,790
想换换环境
I wanted a change of scenery.

218
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,240
是想换
Wanted?

219
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,690
还是不得不换
Or needed?

220
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,060
你到底想说什么
You got something you want to say?

221
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,500
我听到些让我担心的传言
I heard some rumors that got me concerned.

222
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,590
我只是想多了解下我的同事
I just like to know what I'm dealing with.

223
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,320
卡特  既然你这么友好
Carter, I'm going to buy you a coffee.

224
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,740
那我给你买杯咖啡去
Since you've been so nice.

225
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,130
加奶不加糖
Cream, no sugar.

226
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,890
随叫随到
Oh, he comes when he's called.

227
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,870
表现不错
Good.

228
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,230
如果你不再想干掉我  那就完美了
Now if I could just train you to stop trying to kill me.

229
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,310
我还得在这儿工作多久
How long am I going to have to work down here?

230
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,070
上下班太不方便了
Commute's a bitch.

231
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,740
别抱怨了
You should be grateful.

232
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,390
不是所有人都能调到特遣队
Takes some guys years to make task force.

233
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,160
而且  还有我罩着你呢
Plus, I let you live.

234
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,440
卡特查得怎么样了
Carter, is she getting close?

235
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,490
我只知道
All I know right now

236
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,310
你惹了个不好惹的角色  伙计
Is you pissed off real police, my friend.

237
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,290
她不抓住你不会罢休
She's not going to stop till she got you.

238
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,250
说完了吗
Is that it?

239
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,480
做下弹道测试
Ballistics.

240
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,470
再查查看有没有
And find out if there's been

241
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,470
为赎金的绑架案记录
Any ransom kidnappings reported.

242
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,250
平头白人
White guys with crew cuts.

其中一人长发
One with long hair.

244
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,300
绑架可是大新闻
Kidnapping's big news.

245
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,690
如果有我肯定知道
I'd have heard something.

246
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,810
那有没有安珀警戒
What about amber alerts?

247
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,810
当国内确认发生儿童绑架案时  透过各种媒体向社会大众传播的一种警戒告知

248
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,620
诱拐儿童
Child abduction?

249
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,150
我们要查这个吗
Is that what we're dealing with?

250
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,270
什么我们
We?

251
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,140
我们啥时候成一国的了
Since when are you on board?

252
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,670
这关系到一个失踪的孩子
It's still a missing kid.

253
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,650
不管我做过什么  我至少还是警察
Hey, whatever else I've done, I'm still a cop.

254
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,400
你需要帮助  我义不容辞
If you need some help, you let me know.

255
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,310
知道了吧
You understand?

256
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,370
我破了电话公司的防火墙
I cracked the cell company's firewall.

257
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,530
那个盯梢的手机是用现金
The spotter's phone was purchased with cash

258
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,730
以假身份购买
And a phony name.

259
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,840
但绑匪总得睡觉吧
But our kidnappers have to sleep somewhere.

260
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,370
手机的定位数据显示
The location data puts this phone

261
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,690
这人每晚都呆在布鲁克林的一个街区
On the same block in Brooklyn every night--

262
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,110
富兰克林和威斯街交口14号
14th between Franklin and Wythe.

263
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,280
那我这就去会会他
Then I'll hit him where he lives.

264
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,140
芬奇
Finch.

265
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,900
我找到了那家伙
I just found our guy.

266
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,990
他招了吗
Is he talking?

267
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,610
现在还不行
Not at the moment.

268
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,380
莱昂・约瑟夫・特斯基  结尾是"夫"
Turski, Leon Josef, with an "F".

269
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,400
慢着
Hold on.

270
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,370
芬奇  我知道是谁绑架了萨姆

沙亚卡・普斯科夫・泽万――SP-9

一支凶残的东欧街头混混团伙
It's a nasty street gang from eastern Europe.

273
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,520
你以前和他们打过交道吗
You dealt with them in your former employment?

274
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,640
他们和普什图军阀有生意往来
They were trading with the Pashtun Warlords.

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,960
用枪交易海洛因
Guns for heroin.

276
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,380
但他们也在华沙做绑架勾当
But they also run kidnappings in Warsaw.

277
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,150
看来他们还把业务拓展到纽约来了
Looks like they just opened up a new branch in New York.

278
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,080
来吧  我们去溜一圈
Come on, let's go for a ride.

279

287
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,180
录什么音  都没人说话
What audio? Nobody said boo.

288

检验医生说她两小时前就死了

290
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,300
不  我觉得是他报的警
No, I think he called 911.

291

我儿子放学回来时她就不在

法官大人  感谢您的配合  
Thanks for your time, judge.

308
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,920
克里斯蒂娜之前...
Christina was, um...

309
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,770
她...
She was, uh...

310
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,290
在伊丽莎白去世时就陪在我们身边
With us the night that Elizabeth died.

311
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,200
她对萨姆很好
She was so good with Sam.

312
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,660
她还只是个孩子
She was just a kid.

313
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
他还活着  好吗
He's alive, okay?

314
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,290
只要萨姆还有利用价值  他们就不会杀他
As long as they need him, Sam's still alive.

315
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,530
你也说不准
You don't know that.

316
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,800
法官大人  你得帮我
I need your help, judge.

317
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,690
你听说过沙亚卡・普斯科夫  SP-9吗
Have you ever heard of the szajka pruszkow, sp-9?

318
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,790
你到底是什么人
What are you?

319
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,850
退役的警察吗
An ex-cop?

320
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,880
还是调查局的人
FBI?

321
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,330
我有过类似的经历
I have experience in situations like this.

322
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,400
你只要知道这个就行
That's all you need to know.

323
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
是吗
Yeah?

324
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,700
或许你一个人解决不了问题
Well, maybe you're not enough.

325
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,820
或许我该把那警察叫回来
Maybe I should call those officers back

326
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,000
告诉他实情
And tell them the truth.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,450
我知道如何不打草惊蛇
I know how to be invisible.

328
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,320
而警察和调查局探员没法办到
The police and the fBI don't.

329
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,960
但不管怎样我都会救出你儿子
But I'm going after your son regardless.

330
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,470
现在告诉我  你听说过SP-9吗
Now, have you ever heard of a gang called sp-9?

331
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,350
没有
No.

332
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,160
他们是谁
Who are they?

333
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,900
是他们打来的
That's them now.

334
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,570
喂
Hello?

335
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,750
你一个人吗
You're alone?

336
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,040
是的
Yes.

337
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,340
你得证明我儿子还活着
I need proof that my son is alive.

338
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,740
让他听电话
Put Sam on the phone.

339
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
爸爸
Dad?

340
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,660
萨姆...你没事吧
Sam... are you hurt?

341
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,640
爸爸  救我  我想回家
Dad, please, I want to go home!

342
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,830
萨姆
Sam, Sam!

343
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,130
别急啊  法官大人
Relax, your honor.

344
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,500
你儿子在这里很好
Your son is just fine.

他是个好孩子

346
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,650
跟你一样聪明

347

你要多少钱

348

你要什么我都给你
I'll pay anything you want.

349

看吧

350
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,790
我就说你聪明

351
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,790
但算你走运  我们不要钱
But, fortunately for you, we don't want your money.

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,010
我们想要你帮忙
We want your help.

353
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,770
你现在处理的一个案子
There's a case in your court right now,

354
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,810
是安琪拉・马汉的案子

355
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,500
我要让检方败诉
The people... are going to lose.

356
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,810
什么
What?

357
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,650
法官  撤销原案
Throw the case, judge.

358
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,130
让安琪拉・马汉被判无罪
Angela Markham walks.

359
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,510
不然你儿子就没命了
Or your son dies.

360
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,940
安琪拉・马汉
Angela Markham?

361
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,430
她在停车场撞伤了人
She mowed down some guy in a parking garage.

362
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,420
不过是个简单的肇事逃逸案
It's a simple hit and run.

363
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,130
她现在却是找到你儿子的关键
Well, now she's become the key to finding your son.

364
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,610
安琪拉・马汉是贸易中心附近
Angela Markham is an account exec

365
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,810
一家科技公司的账户经理
At a tech company near the trade center.

366
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,160
六周前  她在退休欢送会上喝醉了

367
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,190
开车出车库时撞了一位会计师

368
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,770
她以酒驾和过失杀人被起诉

369
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,740
不过是个偶然的车祸
It's just a random accident.

370
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,950
这个女人和
What does this woman have to do

371
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,330
绑架我儿子的人有什么关系
With the people who took my son?

372
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,390
我不知道
I don't know.

373
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,410
但他们并不只是想杀死萨姆
But it's not just Sam's life they're playing with.

374
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,210
他们也要杀掉你
They're planning to kill you too.

375
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,300
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

376
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,360
你从哪得到的信息
Where are you getting your information?

377
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,040
我的信息渠道绝对可靠
Let's just say I have a source and it's never wrong.

378
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,350
跟这些人没法讲道理
Look, these people can't be reasoned with.

379
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,670
他们不可信任
They can't be trusted.

380
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,460
如果我们要救你儿子
If we're going to save your son,

381
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,910
我要找出能打击他们的方法

382

30分钟后就要继续开庭

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,430
我该做什么
What do I do?

384
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,400
拖延时间就行
Just stall.

385
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,600
假装你在跟他们合作
Make it look like you're cooperating.

386
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,060
但你得给我争取时间
But buy me time.

387
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,720
这明显不是街头混混
Well, this isn't a street gang.

388
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,960
这是跨国团伙
This is a multinational corporation.

389
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,350
SP9起码在世界上18个国家都有活动  范围遍布欧亚
SP-9 is active in at least 18 countries in Europe, Asia--

390
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,700
自从国际刑警拿下了曾经的普斯科夫黑手党后
After Interpol took down the old Pruszkow Mafia,

391
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,800
他们就长进了
They got smarter.

392
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,340
开始掩盖纹身
Started hiding their tattoos,

393
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,650
学起了军事化管理  电脑
Studied military discipline, computers--

394
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,690
几乎找不到他们的数据残留
They have almost no digital footprint.

395
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,570
我还在找任何能找回盖茨他儿子的线索
I have yet to find anything that could help us find Gates' son.

396
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,230
那就重点查她
Then focus on her.

397
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,690
这女的跟那帮派千丝万缕
Somehow this girl and that gang connect.

398
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,890
我敢打赌  睡她的男人
My best guess, whoever she's sleeping with

399
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,520
肯定是SP9里的高层
Is high up in sp-9.

400
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,310
我赌她男朋友知道萨姆被关在哪
Bet her boyfriend knows where they're keeping Sam.

401
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,390
对了我去查那女的  那你去干什么
And while I'm checking into the girl, what'll you be doing?

402
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,320
追查余下的那帮人
Tracking down the rest of them.

403
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,810
我有史以来撬开人嘴巴的记录是16小时
The longest it's ever taken me to break someone is 16 hours.

404
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,140
你看起来不像有要我打破纪录的样子
You don't look like you're going to set a record.

405
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,420
想说话了吗
Want to talk?

406
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,960
你肯定喜欢窝在里面
You must like it in there.

407
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,540
新案子
Caught a fresh one?

408
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,170
我那穿西装的伙计帮我找到了另一个案子
My guy in a suit led me to another case.

409
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,910
布朗克斯的一位保姆午餐休息时被杀了
Nanny from the Bronx murdered on her lunch break.

410
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,700
枪手挖走了弹头
Shooter dug the slugs out, huh?

411
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,870
只有这枚
Just the one,

412
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,230
而且我不确定那是枪手所为
And I'm not so sure that was the shooter.

413
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,620
是我前妻  我必须得接这电话
It's my ex, I've got to take this.

414
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,640
你掐时间的能力真是强到令人发指啊  老兄
You've got a real creepy sense of timing, man.

415
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,420
弹道报告  警探
Ballistics report, detective.

416
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,430
下坠式
Squat.

417
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,190
你的那枚弹头没进警局系统
Your slug's not in the system.

418
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,710
我相当肯定卡特在研究你的罪案现场
And I'm pretty sure that Carter's working your crime scene.

419
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
这个死掉的保姆
Hey, does this dead nanny

420
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,070
跟失踪的小朋友有关系吗
Have anything to do with the missing kid?

421
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,100
我还要东西时候会给你电话
I'll call when I need something else.

422
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,660
你现在需要一切你能用到的协助
You need all the help you can get right now.

423
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,790
我是说  如果我能找出那个保姆杀手
I mean, if I can I.D. The nanny killer,

424
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,280
或许能帮到你找那个小孩
It might help you with the kid.

425
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,340
我有说错吗
Am I wrong?

426
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,950
我会给你我的联系方式
I'll give you a way to contact me.

427
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,440
及时跟我汇报情况  还有别让卡特碍手碍脚
Keep me posted and keep Carter out of my way.

428
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,290
这是什么状况
So what have we got?

429
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,290
初步判定是情感破裂
Primary's thinking romance-gone-bad,

430
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,200
但是一般这种情况都会很乱
But those are always so messy.

431
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
这个现场太干净了
This is too clean.

432
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,270
看看这个枪伤射入口的边缘
Look at the circles on this entrance wound.

433
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,830
你能想到几个气昏头的男朋友
How many pissed-off boyfriends you know

434
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,440
会去买消音器
Go out and buy a silencer?

435
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,170
还情感  情感个球
Romance, my ass.

436
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,810
凶手是职业杀手
Your killer is a pro.

437
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,100
搬把椅子过来做
Pull up a chair.

现在
Now...

447

或者咱再多来几圈
Or you can go for another spin.

449
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,630
你只需要帮我找个吓坏了的小男孩
All you have to do is help me find a scared little boy.

450
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,980
我不知道他在哪  我发誓
I don't know where he is, I swear to god.

451
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,770
谁是安琪拉・马汉  她跟SP9又有什么关系
Who's Angela Markham and what does she have to do with sp-9?

452
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,200
没听过这人
Never heard of her.

453
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,740
我说  我不知道他们为什么想要那孩子
Look, I don't know why they wanted that kid.

454
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,310
你都不知道是吧
You don't know much, do you?

455
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,420
他们就是这么活动
That's how they run it.

456
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,800
他们常常小组活动  有机小组
They work in small teams. Cells.

你的组里都有谁  给我全名

458
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,960
我们只用诨号相称

AK  克拉科夫  索普  宅人
A-K, Krakow, Sops, Ziom.

460
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,080
一共四个人  我就知道这些
Look, there's four guys, that's all I know.

461
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,740
现在求你放我出去好不好
Now would you please let me out of here?

462
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,370
什么都没给我就想出来
For no names and no info?

463
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,530
不是  不是  不是  慢  慢  慢
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

464
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,610
别  等等
Okay, wait.

465
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,260
我知道个地方
I know a place.

466
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,620
洛里默街3185号
It's 3185 Lorimer.

467
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,060
我就是去那个地方拿钱
It's where I go to get paid.

468
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,690
很好
Good.

469
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,810
你这叫我怎么吃啊
How am I supposed to eat it?

470
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,410
你自己搞定
You'll figure it out.

471
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,450
我观察到一辆白色SUV以高速横冲直撞
I observed a white suv driving erratically at high speed.

472
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,890
我估计是酒后驾驶  于是就上去拦截了
I stopped the vehicle for a possible DWI.

473
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,550
当你接近那辆车时候你看到什么
And what did you see when you approached the car?

474
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,510
血迹
Blood.

475
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,720
左前轮的挡泥板上
On the front left fender.

476
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,050
反对  上述事实不能作为证供
Objection, facts not in evidence.

477
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,340
反对有效
Sustained.

478
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,650
那车子看起来什么样
Uh, how did the vehicle look?

479
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,110
前后有损伤
There was front end damage.

480
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,750
看起来疑似血液的红色液体
A red fluid that appeared to be blood--

481
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,250
反对  法官大人
Objection, your Honor.

482
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,590
反对有效
Sustained.

483
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,140
然后发生了什么
What happened then?

484
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,740
辩方走出了车辆
The defendant got out of the vehicle.

485
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,710
她看起来醉酒或服用药物
She appeared to be intoxicated.

486
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,630
反对
Objection!

487

反对有效
Sustained.

488
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,120
-法官大人  -律师
- Your honor--  - Counselor...

489
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,860
我现在给你些时间
I'm going to give you some time

490
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,860
好让你的证人再准备准备
To better prepare your witness.

491
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,310
明天上午十时继续
Resume at 10:00 A.M. Tomorrow.

492
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,570
盖茨法官
Judge Gates.

493
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,520
我很失望  法官大人
I'm disappointed, your Honor.

494
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,570
你怎么知道我在这
How did you know I was here?

495
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,660
是她告诉你的吗
Did she tell you?

496
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,070
安琪拉・马汉到底是你什么人
Who is Angela Markham to you anyway?

497
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,340
你是不是不想要你儿子回家了
You don't want your son back, is that it?

498
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,450
让我跟他说话
Let me talk to him.

499
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,070
等你不再拖时间了再说
Not until you stop stalling.

500
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,510
听好
Look...

501
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,130
我只能这么做  否则地检官会上诉
I have to do this right or the D.A. Can appeal.

502
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,900
你想她重获自由
You want her free,

503
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,080
我就得确保她保持如此
I have to make sure she stays that way.

504
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,140
做事要对
Do it right.

505
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,790
动作要快
And do it fast.

506
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,890
还有别忘了你耍花样的代价
And don't forget what you're playing for.

507
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,090
我们没时间了  里瑟先生
We're running out of time, Mr. Reese.

508
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,010
你查出关于安琪拉的情况了吗
Did you dig up anything on Angela?

509
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,510
跟你讲话这会我都在过滤她的通信录和邮件
Going through her contacts and emails even as we speak.

510
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,980
帮派那边怎么样
Any progress with the gang?

511
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,140
我从莱昂・特斯基那边要到了个地址
I got an address from Leon Turski.

512
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,540
这就过去
On my way now.

513
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,960
已经差不多了
It's as good as done.

514
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,360
怎么  你以为我傻啊
What, do you think I'm stupid?

515
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,190
我没获得自由撤销罪名之前都不算完
It's not done until I'm free and clear.

516
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,990
你这样就没意思了
This is bad for business.

517
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,290
我的客户不耐烦了
My clients are asking questions.

518
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,460
那不是我的问题
That's not my problem.

519
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,950
你才是问题
You are the problem.

520
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,720
我们整个行动都危在旦夕
Our whole operation is in jeopardy

521
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,190
就因为你多喝了几杯
Because you had too many shots.

522
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,170
除非你认识有人能干我干的活
Unless you know someone who can do what I do,

523
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,420
否则交易继续
Our deal stands.

524
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,040
一旦你撤销了罪名  我就回去工作
Once you get the charges dropped, I go back to work.

525
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,730
一切照常
Business as usual.

526
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,420
那孩子在哪
Where's the boy?

527
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,050
我不知道
I don't know!

528
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,050
芬奇
Finch...

529
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,860
刚找出来一个能打击他们的办法
Just found a way to make these guys hurt.

530
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,310
还不去找  给我去找是谁拿了
Well, find it and find out who took it.

531
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,610
我手下有两个人失踪了  外加五十万的钱
I am missing two men and $1/2 million.

532
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,460
有人在搞我们
Someone is making a move against us.

533
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,880
我要知道是谁
I need to know who!

534
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,520
通知你们的组员
Contact your teams!

535
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,510
改变计划
Change of plans.

536
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,170
我想我知道了为什么他们不要钱了
I guess we know why they didn't ask for money.

537
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,310
除了这个我那还有六个这样的包
I have six more just like it.

538
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,290
可以作为我们跟他们讨价还价的筹码
Could be our bargaining chip to get Sam.

539
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,700
放这些的地方可能还有更多
There may be lots more where these came from.

540
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,380
安琪拉没有跟绑架犯上床
Angela's not sleeping with our kidnapper.

541
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,450
我认为她在跟他做交易
I think she's in business with him.

542
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,340
她供职的那家技术公司
That tech company she works for,

543
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,970
他们做银行软件
They make banking software.

544
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,510
能监控洗钱的那种
The kind that can spot money laundering.

545
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,980
我刚好发现一间满是小额钞票的房间
And I just found a room full of small bills.

546
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,270
09年的时候  她监督了一州银行
In 2009, she oversaw the installation

547
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,820
反洗钱系统的全部安装过程
Of a new anti-money laundering system at Onestate Bank.

548
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,220
如果她仍有权限的话
If she still has access,

549
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,570
她按下鼠标就能关掉整个系统
She could turn that whole system off with the click of a mouse.

550
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,310
于是SP9就能利用世界最大的银行之一
Then sp-9 uses one of the biggest banks in the world

551
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,500
来洗白黑钱
To clean its dirty money.

552
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,700
他们不会留下任何数据残留
They leave no digital footprint

553
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,400
因为这就是他们付钱的方式
Because this is how they pay for things.

554
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,680
汽车  律师  安全屋
Cars, lawyers, safe houses.

555
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,780
如果我们能够接触到这些账户
If we can access those accounts,

556
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,070
我们有的就不只是谈判筹码了
We'll have more than a bargaining chip.

557
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,280
我们就能找到小萨姆
We'll have a way to find Sam junior.

558
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,020
他们知道我在拖延时间了
They know I'm stalling.

559
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,000
我们快了
We're getting close.

560
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,380
只要再拖住一小会就行了
Just need to hold off a little longer.

561
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,300
我给过你机会了
You had your chance.

562
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,330
我不会再拿我儿子的性命冒险了
I'm not playing games with my son's life.

563
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,970
他们一旦得逞就会做掉你们俩灭口
They'll kill you both as soon as they get what they want.

564
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,370
眼下  我能救你儿子
Now, I can save your son.

565
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,120
你必须相信我
You just have to trust me.

566
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,220
根据进一步的复核
Upon further review,

567
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,220
我要收回录像有效性的定论
I'm reversing my decision on admissibility.

568
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,390
法官大人
Your honor!

569
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,960
这段录像不符合均衡原则  律师
It doesn't pass the balancing test, counselor.

570
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,200
这会对陪审团做出对马汉女士的判决产生误导
This video would unfairly bias the jury against miss Markham.

571
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,370
那我要求审判无效
Then I move for a mistrial.

572
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,260
拒绝
Denied.

573
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,130
盖茨法官
Judge Gates--

574
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,270
律师上前
Approach.

575
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,510
你有问题吗  律师
Is there a problem, counselor?

576
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,290
恕我直言  大人
Respectfully, sir...

577
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,310
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

578
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,460
再说一句话你就是藐视法庭
One more word and you are in contempt.

579
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,240
必要的话我会控告你行为不检
I'll have you charged with misconduct if I have to.

580
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
相信我  拉米雷兹女士
Trust me, miss Ramirez.

581
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,330
你不知道我会到什么地步
You have no idea how far I'll go.

582
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,330
没有之后了
Nothing further.

583
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,530
检方结束了
Prosecution rests.

584
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,220
这是账户数据
That's account data.

585
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,300
是绝密的
It's confidential.

586
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,870
不再绝密了  我们被黑了
Not anymore, we just got hacked.

587
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,240
什么  防火墙怎么被破了
What? How did they get past the firewall?

588
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,190
我在解决
I'm working here.

589
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,510
你叫什么  你是谁
What's your name? Who are you?

590
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,650
你的系统崩溃
Considering they called me

591
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,440
而他们通知我来弥补
When your system was compromised,

592
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,500
我想我大概是抢了你饭碗的人吧
I'd say I'm the guy that just took your job.

593
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,970
现在去医院会好受点
A hospital would be nice about now.

594
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,900
孩子在哪
Where's the boy?

595
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,190
我说了  我不知道
I already told you, I don't know.

596
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,000
那你们老大的名字呢  这你总知道吧
How about your boss's name? You know that yet?

597
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,140
我有家人  你也要杀了他们吗
I've got a family. You going to kill them too?

598
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,850
因为我要是说了他就会杀了他们
Because he will.

599
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,300
见过两只猫被塞进袋子里吗
You ever see two cats in a bag?

600
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,270
什么
What?

601
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,760
你想出来吗
You want out?

602
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,900
把老大名字套出来
Get your boss's name.

603
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,530
卡特
Carter.

604
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,240
过来  我想我有发现了
Come here, I think I got something.

605
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,470
我又去那个保姆住处查了下
I did another canvass

606
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,110
发现那里附近有个酒店
and I found a bodega near the Nanny's house

607
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,020
有对着马路的摄像头
With eyes on the street,

608
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,120
而这是纽约警局的监控录像
And it's on the NYPD surveillance feed.

609
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,070
就在谋杀发生的时候
This is right around the time of the murder.

610
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,020
看这个
Look at this.

611
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,160
长发的白人
White guy, long hair,

612

在脱手套

613
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,260
他可能就是凶手
He could be our killer.

614
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,800
也可能人家只是手冷了
Or just a guy with cold hands.

615
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,670
你怎么确认那个长发的就是凶手
What makes you so sure mr. Longhair is our man?

616
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,270
你有我不知道的信息吗
You get a description I don't know about?

617
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,510
我就是这么感觉
I got a hunch.

618
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,820
我查他车牌号想查他名字
I ran his plate to get a name,

619
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,660
结果查到个公司名
But I got a company instead.

620
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,410
科菲尔股份公司
Coldfield Holdings.

621

622
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,340

623
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,810
芬奇  我搞到个名字
Finch, got a name for you.

624
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,450

625
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,300
据说他是老大

626
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,110
如果是他  那他这人很谨慎
Well, if he is, he's careful about it.

627
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,480
没有账户是他的名字
No accounts in his name.

628
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,210
这个行动规模很大
The operation is massive.

629
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,510
每天早上五点

630
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,290
安琪拉会将州银行的软件关闭三分钟

631
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,350
数以万计的钱神不知鬼不觉地流入银行
Millions of dollars flow in undetected.

632
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,690
SP-9不光是自己洗钱
SP-9's not just laundering their own money.

633
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
他们还有几百名客户
They have hundreds of clients.

634
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,170
肯定都是犯罪分子
All criminal themselves, I'm sure.

635
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,270
如果科斯卡用的是个皮包公司
If Koska's using a shell corporation,

636
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,030
那得花上一番功夫才能查出来
It could take hours to find it.

看来这些钱被用来购买...

643
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,090
大多都在纽约
Most of it right here in new york.

644
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,490
就是他们  把名单列出来
That's them, get a list.

645
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,740
萨姆可能就在其中一个地方

646
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,470

如果我能找到萨姆  法官就不用撤销原案了
If I can find Sam, the judge won't have to throw her case.

650
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,860
那你最好快点
Well, you better move fast.

651
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,730
安琪拉的陪审团已经有裁决了
I think Angela's jury just reached a verdict.

652
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,440
芬奇  如果我四分钟内没联系你就报警
Finch, if you don't hear from me in four minutes, call 911.

陪审团有裁决了吗

裁决是什么
What say you?

658
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,750
没找到萨姆

659
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,170
我们认为辩方
We find the defendant...

660
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,980
无罪
not guilty on all charges.

661
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,320
如果你想要回你儿子  一个人来

不准带手机  GPS和武器

664

这么说安琪拉・马汉无罪了

而盖茨法官也正要去送死
And judge Gates is heading to a death sentence.

667
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,630
机器既然报出了他的号码
The machine sent us his number

668
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,460
就说明他们不管怎样都准备杀了他
Because they were planning to kill him all along.

669
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,850
他和他儿子
Him and his son.

670
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,250

清理现场  毁尸灭迹

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,200
我们得警告他
We need to warn him.

674
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,150
我警告过了  他不听
I've tried. He won't listen.

675
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,560
但我们得有所行动
But we have to do something.

676
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,530
是的
We are.

677
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,840

你就冲着我来
You can keep me,

687
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,210
但求你放了我的儿子
But please let my son go.

688
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,240
抱歉
Sorry.

689
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,900
法官大人

693
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,310
去年一年里你替你的客户

694
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,490
洗钱数量共计四百万美元
At least $400 million to clients

698
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,890
你都是从这个酗酒的婊子那问来的么
So you got some info from that alcoholic bitch.

699
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,980
你也没法再告诉其他人了
I'm the last one you'll ever tell.

700
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,050
人数对你不利啊
These aren't good odds for you.

701
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,470
我不是单枪匹马
I'm not alone.

702
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,650
这里的每一个子儿
Every last dime has been transferred

703

都被转到一个海外账户下
To an offshore account.

704
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,550
照我说的做  也许你还能拿回来
Do exactly what I say and you might get it back.

705
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,740
但如果他们没有安然无恙地离开这
But if they don't walk out of here alive,

706
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,720
我会通知你名单上所有的客户

你把他们的钱都弄不见了

到时我就不必杀你了

709
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,990
你的客户们自然会来杀你

710
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,480
行动取消
The operation's burned.

711

Then take him home.

716

我们去溜一圈吧

723
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,780
我们vs树  已经10比0啦
That's us, 10, trees, 0.

724
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,690
你真奇怪  爸爸
You're so weird, dad.

725
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,690
-再来一次吗  -来啊
- Do it again? - Let's go!

726
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,640
来吧
Here we go!

727
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,920
我没想到还能再见到你
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.

728
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,010
嗯  我不是很擅长...
Yeah, I'm, uh, not great

729
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,840
和人保持联系
At keeping in touch with people.

730
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,580
我不知道该怎么感谢你
I don't know how to thank you.

731
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,840
你什么都不用说
You don't need to say anything.

732
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,890
说实话我更希望你那样
I'd prefer it actually.

733
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,300
听着
Look...

734
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,400
我不知道你究竟是做什么的
I don't know exactly what you do,

735
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,970
也不知道你是怎么做的
Or how you're doing it.

736
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,230
但我知道要是被别人发现了
But I know that if people ever find out...

737
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,480
等到被别人发现了
When they find out...

738
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,060
我可没法保护你
There won't be anything I can do to protect you.

739
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,180
去和你儿子玩吧
Go play with your son.

740
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,940
他说了什么
What did he say?

741
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,150
他说让我们不必担心
That we don't need to worry.

742
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,370
以后他没准还能帮我们
He might even help us someday.

743
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,610
我听着你们的对话呢  里瑟先生
I was listening to your conversation, mr. Reese.

744
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,270
那我是听到了言外之意

745
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,400
那我只能说  等时间来证明一切了
I suppose only time will tell which one of us is right.

746
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
谢谢你
Thank you.

747
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,930
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

748
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,290
谢谢你给我这份工作
For giving me a job.

749
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,540
试试这的火腿蛋松饼  里瑟先生
Try the eggs benedict, mr. Reese.

750
