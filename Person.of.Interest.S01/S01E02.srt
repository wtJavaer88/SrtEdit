此外  我还要更仔细地检查一遍

62
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,940
但监控录像上没有记录

63
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,700
但如果机器是对的而且她确实还活着

65
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,040
但他不接电话
But he's not answering.

66
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,980
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

67
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,150
但她说她很想念你
But she did mention how much she missed you.

68
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,010
但我不明白他们为什么还要追杀她
I'm just not sure why they're still coming after her.

69
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,830
但我不知道的是
But what I don't know

70
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,710
但我从没想过...
But I never-- I never thought

71
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,730

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,570
但我们不知道特蕾莎还有多少时间

74
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,980
但我弄清楚她怎么维持生计了
But I did figure out how she's been providing for herself.

75
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,510
但我认识你  比尔
But I know you, Bill.

76
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,350
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner.

77
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,540
但相信我  你并不想抛弃大家
But, trust me, you don't want to leave people behind.

78
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,780
但这机器不懂其中的区别
But a machine doesn't understand the difference

79
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,780
但这世上还有人爱着你
But you do have someone out there that loves you.

80
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,460
但政府干活都是这样
But, like everything with the government,

81
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,070
当然  你下个月就可以开始动工了
Hell, you can break ground as early as next month.

82
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,520
倒是合理的假设
That's a reasonable assumption.

83
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,500
得教会机器如何进行筛选  从电邮
You have to teach the machine to sift through the emails,

84
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,020
德雷克  还记得这地方吗
Remember this place, Derek?

85
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,950
德雷克  我们得谈谈
Yeah, Derek, we need to talk.

86
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,190
德雷克  我是在谈生意
I'm talking business, Derek.

87
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,830
德雷克  怎么了
What's the matter, Derek?

88
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,820
德雷克没能走出这种恐惧
Derek never came out of the funk.

89
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,490
的确不能解释
No, it wouldn't.

90
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,230

都是单枪匹马  除了一项

100
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,630
对不起  公事缠身

104
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,770
而兰代尔想要独吞

105
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,150
而你却袖手旁观
And you did nothing?

106
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,400
而且一半都被改掉了

而现在是由你在跟他们打交道吧

00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,030
好伪装成抢劫闹出人命的样子

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,980
就为了让他们还债
Just to get their money back out.

321
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,110
让他早早地就进坟墓了

00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,420
如果你要离开你的妻子

324
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,300
如果是的话  你被解雇了
Because if you do, you're fired.

325
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,550
如果她要在网上出售卡的信息

326
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,190
如果这个女孩的号码出现了

359
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,650
搜索特蕾莎・威德克
Stop searching for Theresa?

360
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,390
索尼克是在维护自己的尊严

所以
So.

362

所以叫人杀了他全家
Killed the whole family.

363
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,560
所以那个男人长什么样
So you can't tell me anything

364
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,970
所以你教它分辨二者
So you taught it the difference?

365
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,190
所以你没去投靠他
Is that why you didn't come to him?

366
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,010
所以他们把他一家都揪了出来
So they took him out along with everyone in his family.

367
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,770
所以他们才继续追杀她

所以他们才没杀我

她把这个装在自动取款机上
She left this at an ATM machine.

374
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,860

383
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,550
他会在这儿陪着你
and he's gonna stay with you.

384
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,210
他会照顾好你
He'll take care of you.

388
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,040
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

389
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,480
她可能在周围的房子里
Maybe she's in one of the surrounding buildings.

390
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,330
她肯定还活着
She must be alive.

391
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,210
他肯定很想听听他兄弟的临终遗言

他没有杀掉特蕾莎

他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手

他们好像看到两个人上去
Two people coming and going,

400

他们或许知道威家到底面卷入了什么麻烦

我们一起去吃顿饭怎么样

我们造这台机器不是为了保护某个人
We didn't build this to save somebody.

529
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,000

要杀他们

593
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
要是你当初站出来  还你哥哥清白

595
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,810
也解释不了为什么她至今未在别处出现

596
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,500
也理解隐姓埋名的感受

597
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,340
也是个杀手
A killer.

598
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,090
一个有能力介入其中的人

599

伊丽莎白・威德克吗
Elizabeth Whitaker?

600
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,340
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,180
因为不是他做的

604
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,420
因为受当局的追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

605
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,930
因为特蕾莎・威德克应该躺在这
You see, Theresa Whitaker should be right here.

606
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,100
因为这是桩雇凶杀人案
'cause this was a hit for hire,

607
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,830
应该说我更像独立承包商
I'm more like an independent contractor.

608
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,360
用你的信用卡
Your card.

609
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,100
用他的话说  "插手"了

611
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,920
有的人会被重新安排  获得提升

有什么枪手的信息
What do we know about the shooter?

618
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,090
有时生活中的人就这么没了
Sometimes you just lose people.

619
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,770
有双重身份的人
Living double lives.

620
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,060
有些不服管教  但总的来说是个好孩子
Some disciplinary trouble, but basically a good kid.

621
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,690
有些女人会离开你就算了
Well, some women would just leave you.

622
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,070
又被你扔到牡蛎湾里的那位
