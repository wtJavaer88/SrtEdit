1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,120
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,020
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,550
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,480
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,490
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,660
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,560
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,610
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,640
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,480
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,010
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,260
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,100
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,030
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,100
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,050
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
If you're number's up, we'll find you.

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,630
他已经在路上了
He's on his way there now.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,460
我们假设他知道多少
What do we assume he knows?

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,690
假设他什么都知道
Assume he knows everything.

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,690
请看管好您的行李
All luggage and cartons must be attended at all times.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,100
无人看管的物品将会由运输管理局

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,600

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,380
不 谢谢  我不喝咖啡
No, thanks. I don't drink coffee.

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,760
这是煎绿茶
Sencha green tea...

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,620
放了一块糖
One sugar.

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,800
你还真是观察入微
You've been paying attention.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,200
别紧张  芬奇  不过是杯茶
Relax, finch. It's just tea.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,830
我还没猜到你最喜欢的颜色
I haven't guessed your favorite color yet.

35
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,450
有新号码
New number...

36
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,540
华莱士・奈格尔
Wallace Negel.

37
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,180
1946年生于德国
Born in Germany, 1946,

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,880
1980年移民美国
Immigrated to the U.S. in 1980,

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,040
在国际出口公司工作
Worked in international export--

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,320
信用良好  按时纳税
Good credit, perfect taxes.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,050
等等  这些日期都正确吗
Wait a minute. Are these dates right?

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,970
你注意到了
You noticed.

43
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,210
奈格尔名下的账户自从1987年12月起
Negel hasn't made a single electronic transaction

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,150
再也没做过任何电子交易
in his own name since december of 1987.

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,150
他这24年去了哪儿
So where has he been for 24 years?

46
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,730
他为什么又回来了
And why is he back?

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,820
我觉得其实没有奈格尔这个人
I don't think there is a Negel.

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,230
外裔  生活平庸
Foreign background, boring life,

49
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,160
需要出差的职业  显然是间谍
A job involving travel-- spycraft 101.

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,030
这是个化名
This is an alias.

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,770
我用过不少化名
I've used dozens of them.

52
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,330
我觉得奈格尔是个伪装
I think Negel is a cover.

53
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,550
那么  我们从何查起
So, where do we start?

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,840
在1987年失踪前不久
Shortly before he disappeared in 1987,

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,680
奈格尔在布朗克斯买了一块墓地
Negel purchased a cemetery plot in the Bronx.

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,420
我查过了  墓地还在
I've checked. It's still there.

57
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,020
为什么一个不存在的人
Why does a person who doesn't exist

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,420
需要一块墓地
need a cemetery plot?

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,380
是吧
Right?

60
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,450
应该值得一查 
Might be worth a look.

61
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,300
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

62
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,230
如果我们的目标是个80年代的间谍
If we're dealing with a spy from the 1980s,

63
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,600
我知道有个人能提供
I know someone who can provide us

64
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,850
我们需要的非数码信息
with the kind of pre-digital information we need--

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,930
在计算机上可查不到
things I can't find on computers.

66
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,810
全是初版
All first editions,

67
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,880
最好的德国历史库
the best available on German history.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,980
记录了冷战的全过程
The entire span of the cold war would do it,

69
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,120
尤其是八十年代
but specifically, the 1980s.

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,990
我需要比书上更详细的内容
And I'll be needing something more precise than books.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,290
我不知道你在说什么
I'm not sure what you mean.

72
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,200
比如你去年卖给俄罗斯
How about the Soviet submarine schematics that you sold

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,100
情报机关的苏联潜艇图纸
back to Russian intelligence last year?

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,500
你向税务局和联邦调查局报告了吗
You register that income with the I.R.S., F.B.I.?

75
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,410
进了监狱就不能继续经营这家书店了吧
It'd be hard to run this store from prison, don't you think?

76
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,430
十八行
Row 18,

77
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,890
二十号
Plot 20.

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,970
你要查谁
What was the name?

79
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,590
华莱士・奈格尔
Wallace negel.

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,980
德国重新统一之前
Before the country reunified,

81
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,310
东德是全世界监控最严密的国家
East Germany was the greatest surveillance state the world has seen.

82
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,820
史塔西掌控着一切
The Stasi knew everything.

83
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,820
前东德国国家安全局缩写

84
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,720
这我知道  我也搞过监控
I've read about them. I'm a sucker for surveillance.

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,560
他们有几百万小时的窃听录音
They had millions of hours of wiretaps,

86
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,090
汗液还有体味的样本
sweat and body-odor samples.

87
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,620
我只要那个化名的真名
I just need a name to go with an alias.

88
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,730
真名是乌里希・科尔
Real name Ulrich Kohl--

89
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,430
一个间谍小组的一员
part of an espionage team.

90
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,700
我读过史塔西的间谍小组的事迹
I've read about the Stasi teams--

91
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,570
科尔所在的小组  跑遍了全世界
Kohl's unit went around the world,

92
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,710
出入于西欧和美国
In and out of western Europe and the U.S.

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,540
所以他需要一个美国身份
That's why he needed the American papers.

94
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,480
这个小组专抓东德的叛徒
The team hunted down east German defectors

95
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,580
让他们在开口之将其终结
And neutralized them before they could talk.

96
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,880
"终结"
"Neutralized."

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,680
这种人去过的地方
Where guys like him went,

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,380
肯定就会死人
People died.

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,690
你怎么会知道潜艇图纸的事
How did you know about the submarine schematics?

100
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,880
告诉你了
Told you...

101
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,370
我也是搞过监控
I'm a sucker for surveillance.

102
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,230
看来柏林墙倒下的时候  科尔在欧洲
Looks like Kohl was in Europe when the wall fell.

103
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,070
西德当局在追杀他
Western authorities were hunting him,

104
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,700
所以他跑到苏联藏了起来
So he ran to hide in the Soviet union.

105
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,380
他的妻子  安雅
His wife, Anja,

106
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,470
史塔西总部的秘书
who worked as a secretary at stasi headquarters,

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,070
和他一起出逃
ran with him.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,780
但没过多久就丧生车祸
But she was killed in a car accident shortly after.

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,710
当时是1987年
That was in 1987.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,290
到了89年  东德解体
By '89, east germany has collapsed.

111
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,440
史塔西不复存在  至于科尔
The stasi no longer exists, and Kohl...

112
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,760
从此杳无音讯
was never heard from again.

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,390
他现在这里了
Well, he's here now.

114
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,100
奈格尔的坟墓
Negel's cemetery plot--

115
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,570
里面藏的是个盒子  他几小时前刚挖走
It was a buried stash kit. He dug it up a few hours ago.

116
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,900
你觉得里面有什么
What do you think was in it?

117
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,570
就和我以前会藏的东西一样
If it was anything like the ones I used to bury,

118
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,310
假身份  武器  当然还有钱
I.D.s, weapons, definitely money.

119
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,690
看来间谍科尔重出江湖了
So it seems Kohl, the spy, is back.

120
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,040
豪夫
Hauffe.

121
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,780
抱歉
Sorry?

122
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,310
你有事吗
Can I help you?

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
你还记得我的安雅吗

124
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,700
这不可能
It can't be you.

125
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,930
我们要好好谈谈
We have something to discuss.

126
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,200
你是新来的吧
You're the new guy, right?

127
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,920
我们去个私密点的地方谈谈
Let's go somewhere private so we can talk.

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,840
你是斯坦顿吧  我是...
You're Stanton? I'm--

129
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,370
不  你不是
No, you're not.

130
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,210
计算机系统给你的身份不符合要求
The I.D. Ncs gave you didn't pass muster,

131
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,110
所以你谁也不是
So you're nobody,

132
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,350
也就是说  我来决定你是谁
Which means I get to name you.

133
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,360
威尔逊好不好
Wilson, maybe.

134
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,320
还是算了  先喝一杯吧
No. You should have a drink.

135
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,220
我工作的时候不喝酒
I don't drink when I'm working.

136
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,290
是吗  那现在起改改吧
No? Well, start.

137
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,890
你们这些一级的小哥都一个样
You tier one boys are all the same--

138
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
紧张过头
Tense.

139
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,610
而在现实中  这会害死我们
Out here, "Tense" gets us killed.

140
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,690
你以前深入敌后
In your old job, you were behind enemy lines

141
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,970
半年  最多一年吧
for 6, 12 months?

142
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,940
但这个工作  你没有退路  
In this job, you never go back,

143
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,970
因为这里没有敌前敌后这一说
Because there is no line to cross back over.

144
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,010
敌人永远都在  明白吗
Never was. Understand?

145
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,230
所以你也放松就可以了
So you may as well get comfortable.

146
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,120
你在路上
When you were in transit,

147
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,790
见到老朋友了吗
Did you see any old friend?

148
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,990
没有
No.

149
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,310
问这个干什么
Why are you asking?

150
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,340
我们知道你的前女友
We know about the ex-girlfriend.

151
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,980
我也说过
Like I told you,

152
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,440
你没有退路
you never go back.

153
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,530
科尔掉的那个硬币
The coin Kohl dropped...

154
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,510
是东德的马克
was an East German mark.

155
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,700
1990年就停止流通了
They've been out of circulation everywhere since 1990.

156
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,000
但我在城里发现了一家绝版硬币兑换店
But I found a rare-coin exchange in the city

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,970
今早刚兑换了一整套马克币
where a whole set of marks was sold this morning.

158
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,180
让我猜猜  卖家就是乌里希・科尔
Let me guess, the seller was Ulrich Kohl.

159
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,010
没错
Correct.

160
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,050
他用店里的电话  有人接了就挂掉
He used the store's phone, waited for an answer, hung up.

161
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,320
我追踪了那通电话  查到一个在西城的地址
I traced the call to that address in the west village--

162
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,130
4A公寓
Apartment 4-a.

163
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,270
芬奇  我们晚了一步
Finch, we're too late.

164
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,680
科尔打来电话  是为了确定他在家
Kohl called to make sure he was home.

165
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,580
他被审问过
He was interrogated.

166
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,810
我翻阅了这些记录
I'm going through more of these records.

167
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,180
科尔曾是一个四人小组的一员
Kohl was part of a four man team.

168
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,690
他和他的组长  史戴勒
He shared trigger duties

169
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,690
是组里的杀手
with a team leader named Steiller.

170
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,720
还有个叫沃尼克的伪造者  专门伪造文件
They were backed by a document forger named Wernick...

171
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,890
他们向一个叫豪夫的情报官汇报
And they reported to a case officer

172
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,730
收取命令
named Hauffe for orders.

173
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,410
死了的那个是谁
So who's this dead guy?

174
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,550
公寓租给了一个叫安德鲁・霍恩的人
The apartment is leased to Andrew Honem--

175
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,050
一个未婚离休的建筑师
An unmarried, retired architect.

176
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,000
科尔的工作是杀死所有的叛徒
Kohl's job was killing defectors.

177
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,700
这个家伙可能就是其中之一
Sounds like this guy might have been one.

178
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,370
等等  芬奇
Hang on, Finch.

179
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,650
这个世界上一半的情报部门
Half the intelligence services in the world

180
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,590
曾经都试图追查这些家伙
were tracking these guys at one point.

181
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,930
但他们就像幽灵  无迹可寻
But they were ghosts-- untraceable.

182
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,970
芬奇  那个官员的名字叫什么
Finch, what was the case officer's name again?

183
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,280
豪夫
Hauffe.

184
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,530
这个死者就是豪夫
This dead guy was Hauffe.

185
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,940
科尔杀了他在史塔西的队友
Kohl killed his Stasi teammate.

186
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,920
而他还会继续杀人
And he will kill again.

187
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,740
我不知道你是谁  也不知道你怎么找到这里
I don't know who you are or how you know to be here,

188
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,140
但这一切只是个开始
But this is just the beginning.

189
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,030
而今天会是漫长的一天
Then this is gonna be a long day.

190
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
芬奇  这还有其他人
Finch, I got company.

191
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,600
BND  德国情报局的
B.N.D.-- German intelligence.

192
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,650
他似乎知道这里发生了什么
He seemed to know what went down here.

193
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,420
他也很确定科尔会再开杀戒
He also seemed sure Kohl would kill again.

194
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,350
我是弗斯科警探
Detective Fusco.

195
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,620
你有个匿名线报  莱奈尔
Anonymous tip for you, Lionel.

196
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,490
你不要再往这里打我电话
You got to stop calling me here.

197
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,220
西城有一起谋杀案
Homicide in the west village.

198
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,700
凶手应该还要杀更多的人
I think the shooter might have others planned today.

199
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,200
我在现场给你留了个小礼物
I left you a care package at the scene.

200
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,600
我要你查清楚他都知道什么
I need you to find out whatever he knows.

201
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,870
好吧  但我什么做不了
Yeah, well, I can't do anything

202
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,100
除非有人报案
Till someone calls in a crime.

203
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,440
你马上就会接到  "有枪击"
You'll get a call-- "Shots fired."

204
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,820
那儿有枪击吗
Were there shots fired?

205
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,090
现在有了
There were now.

206
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,680
豪夫死了
Hauffe's dead.

207
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,720
科尔的下一个目标是谁
Who's next on Kohl's hit list?

208
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,090
我拿到一个德国探员的加密电话
I took an encrypted phone from that German agent.

209
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,670
所有短信都被屏蔽了  除了他们在读的那条
Every text is blocked except for the one they were reading--

210
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,980
朱利安・温纳
Julian Werner.

211
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,260
温纳是个华尔街的律师
Werner is a Wall street lawyer,

212
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,580
并且
And...

213
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,500
温纳其实就是沃尼克
Werner is really Wernick--

214
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,470
那个伪造者
The forger.

215
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,550
科尔的小组都隐姓埋名生活在纽约
Kohl's entire team is living under aliases in New York.

216
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,480
退隐的绝佳场所吧  芬奇
The perfect place to disappear, right, Finch?

217
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,970
这些人都曾经是他的队友
These people were his teammates.

218
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,640
为什么过了二十年  他还要追杀他们
Why would he be hunting them two decades later?

219
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,180
科尔消失得无影无踪
Kohl vanishes without a trace,

220
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,390
而他的队友却在纽约过上无忧无虑的日子
and his teammates end up living cushy lives in New York.

221
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,090
可能他是为了什么而复仇...
This could be revenge for something--

222
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,910
比我们了解的要复杂得多
maybe more than we know.

223
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,890
-没准和他妻子的死有关  -那场车祸
- The wife's death? - The car crash.

224
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,930
她死于87年  同一年他就消失了
She died in '87, the same year he disappeared.

225
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,660
如果车祸是假的我一眼就能看出来
And I know a staged accident when I see it.

226
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,410
我们得赶在科尔之前找到沃尼克
We need to get to Wernick before Kohl does.

227
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,940
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

228
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,120
看来你还带着针啊
Still with the needle, I see.

229
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,780
上面涂了什么
What is it coated with?

230
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,680
发作很快的东西
Something fast.

231
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,400
起码我还能为老同事做到这些
It's the least I could do for an old colleague.

232
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,420
我还有多久
How long have I got?

233
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,290
足够久了
Long enough.

234
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,380
你的口音呢  组长
Where is your accent, Hauptmann?

235
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,950
别人建议我们...
We were advised...

236
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,710
隐没在美国人之中
to blend in America.

237
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,370
今天早上我去看豪夫了
I saw Hauffe this morning.

238
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,080
他是个出色的情报官
He was a good case officer.

239
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,900
这么多年来一直保存着你的信息
He kept information on you all these years.

240
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,050
你还记得
Do you remember...

241
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,570
我的安雅吗
My Anja?

242
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,740
我给温纳的助理打了电话
I called Werner's assistant.

243
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,120
他每天中午都在同一个地方用餐
He has lunch at the same place every day.

244
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,270
我这就去
I'm on my way.

245
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,090
我记得
I remember.

246
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,950
我不知道他们也在追杀她
I didn't know they would go after her, too.

247
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,850
但就算杀了我  她也不能复生  乌里希
But killing me won't bring her back, Ulrich.

248
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,020
我告诉她  我会保护她
I told her I would keep her safe.

249
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,570
你怎么了  乌里希
What happened to you, Ulrich?

250
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,130
我为我的罪孽
I paid...

251
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,370
付出了代价
for my sins,

252
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
你的罪  整个组的罪
For yours, for the team.

253
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
那些抓住我的人把我关在一个洞里
The people who caught me kept me in a hole,

254
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,520
可我从没停止过思考  策划
But I never stopped thinking, planning.

255
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,520
那是很久以前的事了  我已经忘了
It was long ago. I let myself forget.

256
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,790
对我而言遗忘太奢侈
I did not have that luxury.

257
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,930
我们所作的都是错的
It was wrong what we did.

258
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,040
你接下来要对付史戴勒吗
You'll go after Steiller next?

259
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,710
那么
Then...

260
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,920
保重  老朋友
Be at peace, my old friend.

261
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,320
快报警
Call 911.

262
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,850
速派救护车至19街43号
I need an ambulance at 43 19th street--

263
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,920
卡夫吧咖啡馆
Craftbar cafe.

264
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,720
女士  请靠后
Ma'am, stand back, please.

265
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,100
借过
Excuse me.

266
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,200
脉博微弱  心跳过速  血压 70/30
Weak pulse, but tachycardic-- B.P. is 70/30.

267
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,300
呼吸急促  症状显示内部窒息
Shallow respiration, signs of internal asphyxia.

268
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,410
出现抽搐  癫痫发作了
Convulsions-- guy's having a seizure.

269
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,590
喂
Hey!

270
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,860
你不能呼吸
You can't breathe.

271
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,100
你的鼻腔跟口腔里满是泡沫
You have foam in your nose and your mouth.

272
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,210
是氰化物
It's hydrocyanic acid.

273
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,270
他们在四分钟内就能找到我们
Now, they're going to find us in four minutes.

274
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,450
我能救你  但是你得跟我坦白
I can save you, but you need to talk.

275
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,850
科尔为何而来  为什么他要对付你们每个人
What did Kohl come for? Why is he after all of you?

276
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,600
科尔追杀过他们的线人
Kohl was killing their informants.

277
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,320
美国人要他消失
The Americans wanted him gone.

278
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,220
于是你们就交出了科尔
So you gave them Kohl.

279
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,100
他们给了我们新生活
They offered us a new life.

280
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,410
我们就拿乌里希做了交易
We traded Ulrich.

281
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,870
你曾是他的队友
You were his team...

282
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,320
他的朋友
His friends.

283
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,870
这不是个老兵应得的下场
A soldier deserves better.

284
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,070
我给你打这些  你就有救了
I give you these, and you live.

285
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,100
你叛逃之后发生了什么
What happened after you defected?

286
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,180
他们跟我说科尔投奔了苏联人
They told us Kohl ran to the soviets--

287
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,650
他和安雅
He and Anja.

288
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,430
美国人就去抓他
The Americans went for him.

289
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,230
他们也杀了安雅
They got her, too.

290
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,170
那场车祸
The car accident.

291
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,860
对
Yes.

292
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,200
科尔接下来是要找谁
Who will Kohl go after next?

293
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,330
史...
St--

294
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,840
史戴勒
Steiller...

295
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,730
他跟你们一起叛逃了吗
He defected with the rest of you?

296
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,980
喂  他的化名是什么
Hey? What's his alias?

297
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,680
我救下了那个律师  但是科尔还没完
I kept the lawyer alive, but Kohl's not done yet.

298
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,780
科尔的队友背叛了他  还害死了他老婆
Kohl's team betrayed him, and it got his wife killed.

299
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,030
他们为求自保出卖了他
They preserved themselves over him.

300
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,920
真可真不是一般的私仇
This is as personal as it gets.

301
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,120
那么史戴勒在哪
So where's Steiller?

302
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,190
芬奇  我在豪夫的公寓墙上
Finch, I saw the exact same pin

303
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,340
看到了同样的胸针
In Hauffe's apartment.

304
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,780
德裔美国人协会
The Volks American Society...

305
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,770
是居住在纽约的德裔
Is an organization for New York citizens

306
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,570
美国人的老乡会
Of German heritage.

307
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,540
那个史塔西小组叛逃后
When the Stasi team defected,

308
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,640
他们互相之间不能联系
They wouldn't have been allowed to contact each other.

309
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,380
一个德国人组织能给他们三个人
A German organization would give all three

310
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,940
在公开场合会面的机会
A chance to meet in public.

311
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,420
那么  如果豪夫和沃尼克是会员
So, if Hauffe and Wernick were members...

312
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,630
那么史戴勒肯定也是会员
Then Steiller would have been, too.

313
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,120
两个犯罪现场
There are two crime scenes--

314
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,160
一个在西城  一个靠近华尔街
One in the West Village, the other near Wall Street.

315
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,390
同一个穿着灰西装的老年人
Now, the same senior citizen wearing a gray suit

316
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,060
被人目击从两个现场离开
Was seen fleeing both locations.

317
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,500
华尔街
Wall Street?

318
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,910
那就是早些时候救护车被劫的地方吧
That's where the ambulance was jacked earlier, right?

319
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,600
对
It sure was.

320
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,240
看了那劫犯的外观描述了吗
Read the description of who jacked it?

321
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,100
我追查的那人  他是怎么扯进去的
My guy? How's he involved in this?

322
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,520
而这人出现在第一个案发现场还不省人事
And this guy was found unconscious at the first scene.

323
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,340
伤得真漂亮
Nice bruises.

324
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,780
招了没
He say anything yet,

325
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,630
比如是谁把你屁股踢成了四半
Like who kicked his ass sideways?

326
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,050
有倒是有  两个字
Yeah, two words--

327
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,430
电话
"Phone call."

328
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,260
除此之外都是德语
Everything else is in German.

329
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,040
这些人里有没有你看着眼熟的
Either of these guys look familiar to you?

330
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,530
好了  我们知道你是德国情报人员
Now, we know you're German intel.

331
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,860
我们知道很多
We know a lot.

332
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,360
如果这就是你们知道的  警察同志
If that's all you know, Polizei,

333
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,210
那明显你们知道的还不够多
Then you don't know very much.

334
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,870
那你为啥不跟我们说说那个老年男凶犯
Yeah, why don't you tell me about your homicidal geriatric?

335
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,280
两起罪案  很危险的一个人
Two crimes, a very dangerous man at work,

336
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,880
就派一个人来阻止他吗
And one agent trying to stop a killer?

337
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,200
那我们这些警察同志不帮忙就太说不过去了
It'd be a shame if we polizei couldn't help.

338
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,880
他叫科尔
His name is Kohl.

339
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,750
他是名囚犯
He is a prisoner...

340
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,490
于24年前两国政府交锋的行动中
Arrested in an operation between my government and yours

341
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,150
被捕入狱
24 years ago.

342
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,060
他变老了  白发苍苍  于是他们认为真老了
He had become old, feeble, they thought.

343
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,900
命令下来把他转送
The order was given to transfer him

344
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
转移到低强度监管设施
To a minimum security facility.

345
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,170
那我猜是他越狱了
And I'm guessing he escaped.

346
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,800
他聪明又致命
He's smart and lethal.

347
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,710
他杀德国人杀了很多年
And he killed germans for years.

348
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,070
没有什么比抓到他
There is nothing more important

349
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,840
再把他打入天牢更重要的事情了
Than putting him back where he belongs.

350
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
那为什么不通报美国政府
Why not involve U.S. Authorities?

351
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,860
处理他并没有走司法程序
He was jailed without trial.

352
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,650
他本不该存在
Kohl isn't supposed to exist.

353
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,750
没人想要个国际纠纷
No one wants an international incident.

354
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,320
你们本就不该在美国境内活动
You aren't supposed to be operating on U.S. Soil.

355
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,260
他所到之处  必定有人要死
Where he goes, people will keep dying.

356
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,030
那就帮我们  我们所求一致
Then help us. We want the same thing.

357
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,130
不要在多说一个字
Don't say another word.

358
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,530
喂  我们正审讯中
Hey, whoa, this is an interrogation.

359
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,930
-你不能进这来  -审讯结束了
 - You can't be in here.  - This interview is over.

360
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,370
我是德国使领馆的人
I am from the German Consulate,

361
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,200
这是来自美国国务院的命令
And this is from the U.S. State Department--

362
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,250
要求将此人立即遣返德国
Orders to extradite him back to Germany immediately.

363
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,110
德裔美国人社区网站甚至连
The Volks American website wasn't even using

364
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,110
像样的安全代理都不用
An open SSH secure proxy.

365
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,920
几秒钟时间我就复制了他们的登录表
I cloned their log-in form in seconds.

366
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,520
芬奇  说重点
Finch, the point?

367
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,550
我找到了完整的会员名册
I found the complete membership roster.

368
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,090
豪夫和沃尼克都在上面
Hauffe and Wernick are both on it.

369
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,190
我正在对其它成员进行背景追查
I'm running background checks on the other members.

370
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,360
这里  迈克・斯坦根
Here... Michael Stegans--

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,230
纳瓦克的建筑包工头
Construction foreman from Newark.

372
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,130
信用记录是从1988年开始
Credit scores only go back to 1988.

373
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,730
如果符合这个模式
If the pattern follows...

374
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,010
那么这个斯坦根就是史戴勒
Then Stegans is really Steiller.

375
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,240
他在布鲁克林有个建筑工地
He's running a construction site in Brooklyn.

376
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,090
我有他的手机
I have a cell phone.

377
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,530
喂
Hello?

378
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,460
史戴勒先生
Mr. Steiller?

379
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,620
不好意思
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,240
我想你打错了电话了吧
I-I think you have the wrong number.

381
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,410
没时间装了  你给我听好
There's no time for games. You need to listen.

382
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,770
你还记得乌里希・科尔吗
Do you remember Ulrich Kohl?

383
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,800
他还记得你
He remembers you,

384
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,480
就像他记得其他那些史塔西里的同事
Just like he remembered all his old Stasi colleagues.

385
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,970
他去找你了
He's on his way.

386
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,510
你这是在说一个死人
You're speaking of a dead man.

387
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,480
我知道这天迟早会来
I knew this day would come.

388
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,280
你太强了
You were too good.

389
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,220
我是跟最好的人学的
I learned from the best.

390
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,780
跟你学的
I learned from you.

391
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,360
你曾是我的朋友
You were my friend.

392
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,490
你了解我
You knew me.

393
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,580
了解我妻子
You knew my wife.

394
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,700
她跟我一样相信你
She trusted you as much as I did.

395
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,580
你变了  乌里希
You changed, Ulrich.

396
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,270
我看到了那些任务对你的影响
I watched what the missions did to you--

397
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,570
你眼中的黑暗
The darkness in your eyes.

398
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,790
你相信杀人
You believed in the killing.

399
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,820
你训练我  你成就了如今的我
You trained me. You made me what I was.

400
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,790
我深信我的国家
I believed in my country.

401
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,050
深信你
I believed in you.

402
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,830
我们不能救你
We could not save you.

403
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,240
所以你就抛弃安雅和我  将我们留给那些猎犬
So you left Anja and me to the hounds...

404
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,820
就为了纽约的一间公寓和那点钱
For some money and an apartment in New York city?

405
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,520
我不得不收手
I had to get out.

406
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,910
我够强  我生存下来了
I was strong. I survived.

407
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,610
但是他们对安雅的作为  就
What they did to Anja, though...

408
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,650
你必须为此付出代价
You will pay for that.

409
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,760
慢着  慢着  乌里希
Wait. Wait, Ulrich.

410
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,510
有件事你得知道
There is something you don't know.

411
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,950
我是唯一一个知道的人
I was the only one who knew.

412
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,320
喂
Hello?

413
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,950
喂
Hello?

414
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,930
安雅还活着
Anja is alive?

415
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,330
我们都叛逃后的几年  她找到了我
She found me a few years after we all defected.

416
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,730
她比任何人都要怕你  乌里希
She was more afraid of you than anyone, Ulrich.

417
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,750
所以  你看
So, you see,

418
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,730
你的复仇根本毫无意义
Your revenge was all for nothing.

419
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,130
芬奇  我们得找出安雅
Finch, we need to find Anja.

420
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,950
我觉得科尔刚刚把她列入了名单
I think Kohl just added her to his list.

421
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,370
车祸是伪造的
The car accident was faked.

422
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,320
她是他的妻子  可她还是背叛了他
She was his wife, and she betrayed him.

423
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,610
对于科尔这样的男人来说
To a man like Kohl,

424
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,880
足够把她列为目标了
That makes her just as much a target.

425
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,240
有个杀手逍遥法外
We got a killer out there,

426
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,190
而我们最好的线索却要被遣返
And our best lead is getting deported.

427
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,780
你不是还有那个孤胆英雄神枪手在找同个人嘛
You still got your vigilante looking for the shooter.

428
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,770
这还不算坏
That's not bad news.

429
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,010
你不能派个杀手去抓另一个  警探
You can't send a killer to catch a killer, Detective.

430
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,020
谁叫那家伙能出成果
Hey, your guy still gets results.

431
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,640
已上路
银色小轿车
牌照 SMH 4642

432
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,920
他们接下来会走小路去机场
They'll take side streets to the airport--

433
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,910
标准章程
Standard procedure.

434
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,310
告诉弗斯科警探把领馆的车载GPS
Tell Detective Fusco to send the GPS tracker number

435
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,890
追踪号码发过来
For the consulate car.

436
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,690
我找到他了
I found their position, Mr. Reese,

437
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,630
但你打算怎么阻止他们
But how do you intend to stop them?

438
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,490
里瑟先生  我表示我现在感到很不自在
Mr. Reese, I'm highly uncomfortable being here.

439
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,190
我表示我现在同感
I'm highly uncomfortable having you here,

440
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,880
但我需要个观察手
But I need a spotter.

441
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:18,800
报距离
Range it.

442
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,760
不知道  500码
I don't know. 500 yards?

443
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,220
600码
600.

444
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,500
45度斜风
45-degree oblique wind...

445
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,550
四分之三量风速
3/4 value wind speed.

446
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,810
不错啊  芬奇
Very impressive, Finch.

447
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,170
如果你打偏了怎么办
What if you miss?

448
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,440
我可不知道  从没失手过
I wouldn't know. Never have.

449
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,330
停  我们有外交豁免权
Stop. We have diplomatic immunity.

450
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,340
-可我不是外交家  -那你是谁
 - I'm not a diplomat.  - Who are you?

451
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,190
我是那个还有时间去救安雅的人
I'm the guy who still has time to save Anja Kohl.

452
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,830
我知道她还活着  但我要知道她在哪
Now, I know she's alive, but I need to know where.

453
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,360
我们无可奉告
This man has nothing to say.

454
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,430
任何交涉都会违反
Any communication would violate--

455
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,340
我什么都做不了  如果你能就去救她
There's nothing I can do. Save her if you can.

456
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,340
安娜・克莱恩  晨边高地公寓的一个地址
Anna Klein--an address in morningside heights.

457
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,580
是安雅
It's Anja.

458
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,400
安雅不在这  科尔
Anja isn't here, Kohl.

459
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,700
她很安全
She's safe...

460
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,630
在你碰不到的地方
Where you can't get to her.

461
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,610
维洛德手枪哈
That's a Welrod, isn't it?

462
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,170
开火时只有73分贝
Only 73 decibels when fired.

463
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,670
但这阻止不了我近你身
But it won't stop me before I get to you.

464
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,900
我中枪之后极度没耐性
And I lose my patience when I get shot.

465
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,950
安雅在哪
Wo ist Anja?

466
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,010
你打算怎么办  科尔
What's your plan, Kohl, hmm?

467
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,990
你是要把她也杀了
You gonna kill her, too...

468
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,110
你自己的妻子
Your own wife?

469
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,450
你还没计划是不是
You don't have a plan, do you?

470
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,310
你两边的颈动脉
Your external carotid arteries--

471
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,550
要是被阻断
Obstruct both...

472
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,040
你就会带着剧烈的头痛醒来
And you wake up with quite a headache.

473
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,900
乌里希
Ulrich?

474
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,290
不可能
It can't be.

475
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,610
他是来找我的吧
He's coming for me, isn't he?

476
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,840
是的
Yes.

477
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,040
现在最重要的是把你置于警方保护之下
What's important now is getting you into police custody.

478
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,640
第八区有个警探
There's a detective at the eighth precinct--

479
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,240
不  慢着  我们还不能走
No, wait. We can't go yet.

480
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,850
那里很安全  我保证
It's safe there. I promise.

481
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,310
不是现在  求你了  我得打个电话
Not yet, please. I need to make a phone call.

482
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,090
相机
A camera...

483
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,190
真赞
It's extraordinary.

484
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,810
史塔西可会为了这种技术杀人
The Stasi would have killed for this technology.

485
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,620
安雅在哪
Wo ist anja?

486
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,690
人旅行的时候  会学到一些东西
When you travel, you pick up things--

487
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,480
技能
Skills...

488
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,920
物品
Items.

489
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,930
他们都嘲笑我
They all laughed at me

490
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,330
嘲笑我学着用这些针头
When I learned to use these needles.

491
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,010
他们都笑不久
They didn't laugh for long.

492
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,480
我
I was, uh...

493
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,960
在坎大哈时曾被叛军巡逻队绑架走
Bagged by an insurgent patrol when I was in Kandahar.

494
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,300
他们试过电击我
They used electricity on me...

495
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,170
16小时
16 hours.

496
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,130
他们想要的不过是我的名字
All they wanted was my name.

497
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,200
我才不管你名字
I don't care for your name.

498
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,780
尺骨神经是人体内
The ulnar nerve is the largest nerve

499
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,810
没有防护的最大一个神经丛
In the human body that is unprotected.

500
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,760
从肩膀一直通到甲床
It goes from the shoulder, to the fingernail beds,

501
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,480
当经过手肘的时候
When it passes through the elbow,

502
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,760
也就是所谓的"麻骨神经"
It's known as the funny bone.

503
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,870
安雅在哪
Wo ist Anja?

504
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,970
别紧张  我们是自己人
Relax. We're on the same team.

505
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,250
更何况  我这衣服要怎么藏枪啊
And besides, where would I hide a gun in this dress?

506
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,950
你是斯坦顿吧
You're Stanton, right?

507
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,240
这是谁
Who's this?

508
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,010
还没决定呢
Haven't decided yet.

509
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,440
米勒说你们喜欢波本威士忌
Miller said you like bourbon.

510
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,950
你知道他们在这边喝什么吗
You know what they drink here?

511
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,620
李子白兰地
Plum brandy.

512
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,870
-米勒可惜了  -他怎么了
- A shame about Miller. - what happened to him?

513
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,190
没有完成任务
Wasn't getting the job done.

514
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,620
上面发话了
Word came down--

515
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,510
是时候该清理门户了
Time to take the gloves off.

516
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,450
那我们能为你们做什么
So... what can we do for you?

517
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,590
我们在调查关于阿利姆・阿西尔
We're looking into reports that Alim Assir

518
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,270
几周前来到国内的消息
was in country last week,

519
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,500
他也许是来确保他的资金
Possibly to secure financing.

520
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,620
我们上周把所有的情报人员
We sent all of our intel

521
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,290
都派到了中情局
in the pouch to Langley last week.

522
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,350
而阿西尔两天前安然无恙地
and Assir made it out of the country safely

523
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,860
离开了美国
Two days ago.

524
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,470
我们要知道为什么
We want to know how.

525
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,860
我们得到的消息也是
That's also in our intel.

526
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,830
正如我们所说  他肯定贿赂了海关一大笔钱
Like we said, he must have paid customs a fortune.

527
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,880
那他又给了你们多少钱
And how much did he pay you?

528
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,910
开玩笑的啦
Kidding.

529
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,440
我刚也说了  你们哥几个也太紧张了
It's like I said-- you boys are too tense.

530
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,160
该好好放松一下了
Here's to taking the gloves off.

531
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,710
你是在开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

532
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,410
他们没走多远吧
They didn't get very far, did they?

533
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,660
谢谢
Thank you.

534
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,120
还记得我们那位伙计
Remember our friend,

535
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,730
那个被护送去机场的德国特工吗
The german agent and his escort to JFK?

536
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,090
有个西装男在半路上
Apparently a guy in a suit shot them off the road

537
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,200
用把大口径杀器把他们拦了下来
With a high-caliber weapon.

538
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,940
我要去现场
I'm going to the scene,

539
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,360
看看那家伙有没有留下关于科尔的线索
See if my guy left a trail that leads to Kohl.

540
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,520
-我是弗斯科警探  -我要你帮忙
- Detective fusco. - I need your help.

541
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,430
听好  先是他使唤我  现在你也来
Look... First him, now you.

542
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,560
听着  你们两口子可不能随便把我当佣人使唤啊
Look, you guys just can't ring me up like I'm a bellhop.

543
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,500
我们共同的朋友去追捕那个凶手了
Our mutual friend went after your perpetrator,

544
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,490
而他好久没和我联系  肯定出事了
And I haven't heard from him-- something's wrong.

545
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,010
那个男人比我们想的还要危险
This man may be more dangerous than we anticipated.

546
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,770
我要你查一下...
I need you to check on--

547
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,440
听着  我费了不少功夫让卡特相信
Look, I'm doing everything I can to convince Carter

548
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,240
你家那位不是个麻烦
Your boy's not a problem.

549
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,700
现在你又要让我的努力打水漂吗
Now you want me to just walk off the job?

550
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,730
这就得你自己想办法解决了  事态紧急
Then you need to figure something out--it's urgent.

551
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,930
我给你发个地址
I'm sending you an address.

552
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,970
没人接吗
Not getting a response?

553
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,810
我知道你不认识我  但我可以帮你
I know you don't know me, but I'm someone who can help.

554
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,800
你只能杀了我  科尔
You're gonna have to kill me, Kohl.

555
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,300
没有人喜欢杀人
Nobody enjoys taking life.

556
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,720
我很擅长杀人
Killing is what I was good at.

557
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,070
我发现了
I noticed.

558
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,720
你用在沃尼克身上的氰化氢
That hydrogen cyanide that you used on Wernick--

559
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,760
这不是你带来的现成货
You didn't bring that into the country.

560
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,750
是你在这里自己做的吧
You bought that here and mixed it yourself...

561
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,480
没错吧
Didn't you?

562
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,020
你...
You're...

563
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,270
对毒药很熟悉吗
Familiar with poisons?

564
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,830
我接触过一些
Oh, I've had some experience.

565
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,310
我杀过很多人
I have taken lives...

566
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,270
用步枪...
Positioned on a wall...

567
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,540
把他们钉在墙上
With a rifle.

568
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,930
然后史塔西的人来了
Then the Stasi came calling.

569
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,590
他们说  你的国家需要你
They said, "Your country needs you."

570
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,590
他们总是这么说
They always say that.

571
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,940
为了我的国家  我背井离乡
For my country, I left my country...

572
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,230
他们派我到哪  我就杀到哪
And killed wherever they sent me.

573
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,720
就因为这样  我被当做是怪物
For that, I was called a monster.

574
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,130
就算是再黑暗的心  也是人心
Even the blackest heart still beats.

575
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,890
我以前和你一样  科尔
I was you, Kohl.

576
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,330
复仇帮不了你
Revenge won't help.

577
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,570
二十四年来
24 years...

578
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,250
他们把我关在那种不堪的地方
They kept me buried in that hellhole.

579
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
我满脑子的念头就是活到今天
I thought about nothing but today.

580
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,230
那明天呢
What about tomorrow?

581
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,090
我必须见她
I have to see her...

582
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,650
我的安雅
My Anja.

583
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,540
臂神经丛是神经网络
The brachial plexus is a network of nerves.

584
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,010
乌里希常常出去工作
Ulrich was always gone for work,

585
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,980
但他和我在一起的时候  他爱着我
But when he was with me, he loved me...

586
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,470
我也爱着他
And I loved him.

587
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,740
我是个间谍的妻子
I was the wife of a spy.

588
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,400
我知道他不能说起他的工作
I knew he couldn't talk about what he did.

589
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,470
有天他回到家
Then one day he came home

590
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,710
说史塔西背叛了他
And said the Stasi had turned on him.

591
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,470
所以你们逃去了苏联
So then you fled to the Soviet Union.

592
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,410
他觉得那里还安全
He thought it was still safe there.

593
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,970
我们分头上路
We traveled separately.

594
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,220
然后美国人找到了我
That's when the americans found me.

595
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,350
他们给我看了照片
Then they showed me photos.

596
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,110
所有那些暗杀
Of all the assassinations.

597
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,820
我告诉自己  是他先骗了我
I told myself that he had lied first.

598
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,800
这么多人死了
So much death...

599
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,520
他怎么能这样
How could he?

600
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,800
美国人伪造了车祸
The americans staged

601
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,940
把我保护了起来
The car accident to keep me safe.

602
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,820
乌里希认为我死了
Ulrich believed I was dead.

603
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,620
但我开始了新的生活
But I started a new life.

604
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,120
这要耗上一整晚
This could take all night.

605
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,830
她的眼睛和她母亲一样
She has my mother's eyes.

606
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,370
别做傻事  乌里希
Don't do anything stupid, Ulrich.

607
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,690
是你藏起来的吗
You hid this?

608
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,550
她叫玛丽
Her name is Marie.

609

对你我来说已经太迟了

他们怎么可以把她从我身边夺走

那女孩有个机会  你不要毁了她
