1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,200
你被监视着...
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,300
政府有一个秘密系统
The government has a secret system,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,200
一台每时每刻监视你的机器
a machine, that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,800
我知道 因为...是我建造的
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,300
我设计这台机器是为了侦查恐怖活动 但它却监视一切...
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,200
包括普通民众的暴力犯罪 你我这样的人
Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,500
政府觉得这些罪案无关紧要
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,800
他们视若无睹 所以我决定站出来
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,300
但我需要一个搭档 一个有能力介入的人
But I needed a partner- Someone with the skills to intervene.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,200
在当局的围追堵截下 我们秘密工作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,900
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,300
但无论是受害者还是犯案者 一旦你的号码出现 我们就会找到你
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:54,700

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,300
- 有那孩子的迹象么? - 没有
- Any sign of the kid? - No.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,600
还在找
Still looking.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
就知道我们不该信任他
Knew we shouldn't have trusted him.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
嘴上无毛 办事不牢
Damn kid's always been reckless.

20
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
Reese先生 只要你准备好了
Whenever you're ready, Mr. Reese.

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,400
我就在这里
I'm in here.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
你从哪来?
Where did you come from?

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,900
我突破了时空连续统一体
I breached the space-time continuum.

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,200
不是真的
Not really.

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
我确实感觉到隐私被侵犯了
I did sense my privacy being invaded.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,700
但现在先不谈这个 我们还有工作要做
But we'll leave that for now. We have work to do.

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,000
号码们出来了
Numbers have come in.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
- 号码们 什么意思? - 复数的通用意思
What do you mean, numbers? What plurals usually mean.

29
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,900
多于一个
More than one.

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,200
这次是4个
In this case four.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Claire Ryan 42岁 纽约大学讲师

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,600
还有Paula Vasquez 23岁 待业
And Paula Vasquez, 23, unemployed.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,500
他们似乎完全是随机的
They seem completely random.

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,800
一般来说 当机器给我们 发来像这样的集群时
Usually, when the machine sends us number clusters like this,

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,800
是有一定联系的
there is some connection.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
所以这四个里可能有一个想干掉另外三个
So one of these four could be trying to kill the other three.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,300
或者他们可能都是受害者或是杀手
Or they could all be victims or all killers.

40
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,600
或者如你所说 都是随机的
Or as you say, all random.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
不论是哪一种 我们都需要赶快行动
Either way, we need to move fast.

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,100
虽然只差1毫秒 Claire Ryan的数据是最先出现的
Claire Ryan's number came up first if only by a millisecond.

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,300
皇后区威尔逊242号3C室
242 Wilson in Queens, apartment 3C.

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
说到隐私
Speaking of privacy.

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,900
对你寻找的或可能找到的小心些 Reese先生
Careful what you look for, Mr. Reese, or you might find it.

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,900
坦白说
We have to be straight with you.

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,100
有些事情是不合情理的
Some things don't add up.

48
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
比如?
Like what?

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,400
你去见你的秘密线人
You go to meet your confidential informant,

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,500
Nashus Drake 绰号"瓶盖" 对你来说是可信任的消息来源
one Nashus Drake, AKA "Bottlecap"- According to you a trusted source.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
他枪击你的胸部
He shoots you in the chest.

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
幸运的是你穿着防弹背心
Luckily, you're wearing a vest.

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,100
他在受到不明枪手枪击的时候想杀你的?
He's gonna kill you when he gets shot by an unknown shooter?

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,900
正如我陈述中所说的
Like it says in my statement.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,800
你的陈述中没有说 这个不明枪手来自哪里
Your statement doesn't say where this unknown shooter came from.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
因为我不知道
Because I don't know.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
这里也没说他为什么要这么做
It also doesn't say why he did it.

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,200
也许是因为他看到我要被枪击了
Maybe because he saw me about to get shot.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,600
那么他关心你
So he cares about you.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,500
我怀疑他对我会有任何的兴趣
I doubt he gives a damn about me.

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,000
但这是你最近三个月一直在追的人啊
But this is the man you've been chasing for the last three months.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,100
正如我陈述中所说的 我相信如此
As it says in my statement, I believe so.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,862
所以呢 这个你据说一直在试图逮捕的人
So what, this guy allegedly you've been trying to lock up, - he saves your life? - "Allegedly."

64
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:09,521
- 救了你的命? - "据说"

65
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,500
很聪明
That's clever.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,000
你知道怎样才叫聪明么?
You know what would be clever?

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,600
你假装追捕这个人 但事实上你在为他工作
You pretending to chase this guy when in fact you're working for him.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,300
我想我们谈完了
I think we're done here.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,200
探员 告诉我
Detective, tell me something.

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,000
他有和你联系么?
Has he made contact with you?

71
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,600
和你说过话?
Spoken to you?

72
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
我的陈述你们已经拿到了
You got my statement.

73
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,300
除非我的委托人在场 不然我们不会再交谈
We don't talk again unless my delegate is present.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
所以他来回踱步 来回 来回
So he's pacing back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,300
终于脱掉面具 直走进门 把他自己撞晕
Finally pulls his mask down, walks right into the door, knocks himself out cold.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,200
这天才忘记在面具上留眼窝了
The genius forgot to cut the eyeholes in the mask.

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,300
嘿 Carter
Hey, Carter.

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,400

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
为了Pete 休息一下
Take some time off, for Pete's sake.

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
我的防弹衣被击中了 它可以休息

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
调查什么的进行得怎么样了?
How's it going with the inquiry and everything?

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
老样子
The way these things usually go.

83
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
让你觉得谋杀了自己的亲生母亲一样
They make you feel like you murdered your own mother.

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,900
所以我被困在了办公桌上 而你要和Olson一起工作

85
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
太好了 探员的快乐

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,400
这也许是件好事
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,000
你知道 这会很难
'Cause you know, it would be hard.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
你都不知道到底该感谢他还是逮捕他
You don't know whether to thank the guy or arrest him.

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,200
不 很简单 我会逮捕他

You don't even have a description?

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,900
他很高 穿着一套西装

我一直在努力抓那混蛋
I've been trying to catch the son of a bitch.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,500
我知道他是谁之前不会回答这个
I'm not answering that until I know who he is.

160
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,100
回答问题不然就把警徽交出来

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,000

这个灰色是天生的还是染的?

183
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,000
该死!
Damn it!

184
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,600
Reese先生 我正在跟踪Matt Duggan
Mr. Reese, I'm tracking our friend Matt Duggan.

185
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
他似乎正在经历早期中年危机
Looks like he's having an early midlife crisis.

186
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,400
他刚刚辞掉工作现在在买摩托车
He just quit his job and now he's shopping for motorcycles.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,800
等一下
Hold on.

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,000
我波士顿的阿姨死了 留给我很大一笔零花钱

189
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
觉得该奖励自己一个梦想
Thought I'd treat myself to a dream.

190
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,100
不会太久的 亲爱的

191
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,700
没错 他给自己买了辆新的杜卡迪

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,300
现金付款
Paying cash.

193
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,200
被害的Claire也有大笔花销
Murdered woman Claire was spending big too.

194
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
看看周围  Finch
Look around, Finch.

195
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,100
有人在监视你的人么?
Is anyone watching your guy?

196
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,300
我对这个不太在行
I'm not exactly good at this.

197
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,200
没有 我没看到
No, no one I can see.

198
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
仔细观察
Well, keep your eyes open.

199
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,400
回头给我电话
Call me back.

200
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
是我 那个叫Paula的女孩? 我跟丢她了
Yeah, that Paula girl? I lost her.

202
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,000
她把我甩掉了
She gave me the slip.

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
干得好 探员
Well, good work, Detective.

204
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,000
对不起 好么?
I'm sorry, okay?

205
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,700
还有一件事 我觉得她买了枪支
Look, another thing. I think she bought a firearm.

206
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
你跟丢了她 她还带着武器?
You lost her and she weaponed up?

207
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
你最好还是做你的...
You better stick to your...

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,300
日常工作去吧
Day job.

209
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
抱歉
Excuse me.

210
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
- 我在等Wendy - 对不起

211
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,300
她有急事走了
She had an emergency, had to rush off.

212
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,200
我有空 现在就能帮你
I'm free. I can fit you in now.

213
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
不 不用了 谢谢
No, that's okay. Thank you.

214
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Finch 成果如何?
Hi, um, Finch, what do got?

215
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
我们的人正从陈列室里出来
Our man is coming out of the showroom.

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
留下他的订单 交付定金
Placed his order and left a deposit.

217
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
很好 跟着他
Okay, stay on him.

218
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,700
两个女孩都逃掉了
Both girls just gave us the slip.

219
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,800
等一下 有人留下了童车
Hold on. Someone left a stroller.

220
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,500
- 你在说什么? - 车旁有个婴儿车 我不知道妈妈在...
- What are you talking about? - There's a baby stroller near the car. I don't know where the mom-

221
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,100
哦 她在
Oh, there she is.

222
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,700
天哪 是炸弹!
Oh, my God, it's a bomb!

223
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,900
趴下 趴到地上 Finch
Get down. Get down on the ground, Finch.

224
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,000
我要去警告他!
I have to warn him!

225
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,000
Finch 你还好么?
Finch, are you okay?

226
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,100
Harold!
Harold!

227
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
我看见了 我看到车祸了
I saw it. I saw the crash.

228
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
天啊 他死了
Oh, my God. He's dead.

229
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
那是什么?
What's that stuff?

230
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,300
我猜是可卡因
Uh, I think it's cocaine.

231
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,500
我该更快注意到的
I should have seen it quicker.

232
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
什么样的妈妈会把童车留下呢?
I mean, what kind of a mother leaves a stroller?

233
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,200
她还戴着墨镜和围巾 明显是为了挡住脸
And she was wearing sunglasses and a scarf, obviously to hide her face.

234
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,100
- Finch - 要是我能警告他 他或许还能活着
- Finch. - If I could have warned him, - he might still be here. - Finch.

235
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,400
Finch 你没法救他
You couldn't have saved him.

236
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,000
放手吧
You have to let it go.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,300
我们得专注于那些还活着的人
We have to concentrate on the ones still alive.

238
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,900
- Wendy和Paula - 对
- Wendy and Paula. - Yes.

239
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
我一直在找联系 什么都没有找到
I've looked for connections, found none.

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,300
没有共同的就业史
No shared employment history.

241
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,700
没有社交网络
No social networking.

242
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,900
Paula的在线痕迹微乎其微
Paula's online footprint is miniscule,

243
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,200
所以她要不就是个偏执狂 要不就是喜欢潜水
so she's either the paranoid sort or she likes to fly beneath the radar-

244
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
这两种我都能处得来
Both of which I can relate to.

245
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
- 但我... - Finch 联系
- But I- - Finch, connections.

246
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,400
对 抱歉
Right, I'm sorry.

247
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
智能手机不断寻找wifi信号
Smartphones are constantly searching for wi-fi signals.

248
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,100
它们会记录最近的一百多个wifi热点
And they keep the last hundred or so wi-fi hot spots in their memory.

249
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,400
我正在从Matt Wendy 和Claire的手机里提取
I've extracted that from Matt, Wendy,

250
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,300
用它来测算过去24小时里他们去了哪里
and Claire's phones, and I'm using it to plot where our friends went in the last 24 hours

251
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
来看他们是否有交集
to see if they- To see if they intersect.

252
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,700
罗斯福车道 晚上11:57
Roosevelt Drive... 11:57 PM.

253
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
他们在同一个地点待了4分钟
They were all in the same place for four minutes.

254
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,800
为什么?
Why?

255
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,000
根据交通部的网站 有一场一人死亡的交通意外
According to the d.O.T. Website, there was a traffic accident with a fatality.

256
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,200
死者姓名隐藏
Name of the deceased withheld.

257
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,400
这就是我们的联系
That's our connection.

258
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,300
其中的三个人 但没有偏执狂Paula
For three of them, but not paranoid Paula.

259
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,800
我们没有她的手机 所以我们不知道她那晚在哪里
We don't have her phone, so we don't know where she was that night.

260
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,400
Fusco说她买了一把枪 她可能是杀手
Fusco said she bought a gun. She could be our killer.

261
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,500
接下来你要去找Wendy
Then you need to get to Wendy.

262
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,600
我试过了 她的公寓是空的 而且已经丢弃了自己的手机
I have tried, but her apartment's empty, and she's abandoned her cell phone.

263
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,700
我能找到的唯一亲属 是Wendy住在Putnam县的妈妈Susan 
Only relative I could find- Wendy's mom Susan, lives in Putnam County.

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
- 你在干吗 Carter? - 我无聊了
- What are you doing, Carter? - I got bored.

265
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,000
觉得我能在你的案子上帮点忙
Thought I'd lend you a hand with your case.

266
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,300
我把你的受害者Claire Ryan的指纹 在指纹自动识别系统里检查了
I ran your murder victim Claire Ryan's fingerprints through AFIS.

267
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,000
他们显示两晚前的那场车祸
They showed up at this car crash two nights ago.

268
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,100
Claire的指纹在那辆车上
Claire's prints were on the car.

269
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,300
还有这个人 Matt Duggan
And this guy- Matt Duggan.

270
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,000
CSU认为他们是目击者 在试图帮助车里这个人
CSU thinks they were witnesses trying to help this guy in the car,

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,200
但他死于冲击
but he was killed on impact.

272
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
我一定遗漏了什么 这对我们的案子有什么帮助?
I must have missed something. How does this help our case?

273
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Claire死了 还有Matt
Well, Claire's dead, and so is Matt.

274
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
昨天丧生于汽车爆炸
Killed in a car explosion yesterday.

275
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
这可能是巧合
Which could be a coincidence,

276
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,500
除了Matt刚刚为自己买了 一台全新的杜卡迪 现金支付
except Matt had just bought himself a brand-new Ducati, paying cash.

277
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,900
Claire也购物了
Claire had been shopping too.

278
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,800
所以他们都在车祸现场 都有了钱 都死了
So they're both at the crash, they both get money, they both get dead.

279
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,000
钱一定是车里的
Money must have come from inside the car.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,300
- 谁开的车? - 根据CSU报告 是Hallen众议员的儿子 Jamie
Who was driving it? According to CSU, Congressman Hallen's son, Jamie.

281
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,100
Hallen众议员的儿子被杀了?
A congressman's son gets killed?

282
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,900
这种事怎么会被掩盖呢?
How does that get hushed up?

283
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,200
这位Hallen众议员是华尔街银行调查委员会的
Well, the congressman's on the committee investigating Wall Street banks.

284
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
他还是警察工会的朋友
And he's a friend of the police unions.

285
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,400
我猜这能得到一些善意
I guess that buys some goodwill.

286
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
这是意外么?
Was it an accident?

287
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,400
CSU认为Jamie超速而且吸食了可卡因
CSU thinks Jamie was speeding and on coke.

288
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,200
在车里唯一找到的是Jamie运作的 海地孤儿慈善基金会的小册子
The only thing that was found in the car was a brochure for a haitian orphans charity Jamie ran.

289
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,900
我要去下市局 查下犯罪监控中心的摄像头拍到了什么
I should go down to 1PP, check out what the cameras at the real time crime center saw.

290
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,300
我觉得你该留在办公桌前 就像队长要求的那样
I think you should stay at your desk like the captain told you to.

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Lionel 真荣幸
Lionel, what a pleasure.

292
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,000
我们的受害者Claire Ryan 和两晚前死于车祸的
Our murder victim Claire Ryan- She connects to Congressman Hallen's son, Jamie.

293
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Hallen众议员的儿子Jamie有联系
Died two nights ago in a car crash.

294
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,400
也许你想要把这个 给你戴眼镜的小朋友
Maybe you want to give this to your little friend with the glasses.

295
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
我在这 Fusco探员
I'm here, Detective Fusco.

296
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
没错 你也好
Yeah, right. Hi to you too.

297
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,900
我要说的是Jamie Hallen的车上有两组指纹
Like I was about to say, there were two sets of prints on Jamie Hallen's car.

298
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Claire的和Matt Duggan的
Claire's and a Matt Duggan's.

299
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,800
- 他被杀害了... - 在昨天的爆炸里
- He got killed- - In an explosion yesterday.

300
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,100
Jamie Hallen在罗斯福车道上出了车祸?
Jamie Hallen crashed on Roosevelt Drive?

301
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,200
我以为这本该被掩盖掉的
Thought that was supposed to be hushed.

302
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,600
他们一定是从车祸现场拿到钱的 Finch
Car crash must be where they got the money, Finch.

303
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
天哪 有什么是你不知道的么?
Jeez, anything you don't know?

304
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,100
有 Carter怎么样了?
Yeah. How's Carter doing?

305
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,100
她还在坚持 你知道么?
She's hanging in there, you know?

306
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,600
但当你被困在办公桌边的时候 是很难完成工作的
But it's hard to do the job when you're stuck on your desk.

307
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,300
我们会注意她 确保她没事的
We'll keep an eye on her, make sure she's okay.

308
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,200
还有探员 你和Hallen议员 谈的时候把手机开着
And Detective, leave your phone on when you talk to Congressman Hallen.

309
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,100
你一直能听到我说话?
You can hear me all the time?

310
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,400
是 但我听到更多的是你的肠道
Yes, and I'm hearing rather too much of your lower intestine.

311
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,300
你能把手机从腰带移到上衣口袋么?
Could you possibly move your phone from your belt to your jacket pocket?

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,700
嘿 Fusco 你死在那了?
Hey, Fusco, you die in there?

313
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,200
准备好 我来了
Keep your panties on, I'm coming.

314
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,300
如果有我能帮上忙的 请打电话给我
If there's anything I can do, please call me.

315
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,200
谢谢你 Davis
Thank you, Davis.

316
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

317
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,800
再次对您的悲痛表示深切的同情 议员
And again, deepest sympathies for your loss, Congressman.

318
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,600
谢谢
Appreciate it. Thank you.

319
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
警察 先生
The police, sir.

320
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
探员Olson和Fiasco
Detectives Olson and Fiasco.

321
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Fusco
Fusco.

322
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,500
你们为什么在这?
Why- why are you here?

323
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
我已经和你们的人谈过Jamie的事故了
I already talked to one of your people about Jamie's accident.

324
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,000
我们对此还有些疑问 先生
We have further questions about the accident, sir.

325
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,700
这可能和另一桩案件有关
It may relate to another case.

326
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,500
您对令郎当天晚上的行为了解么?
Do you know your son's movements that night?

327
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,100
他出席了在Davis Bannerman住所办的派对
He was at a party at Davis Bannerman's house.

328
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,800
他丧生的时候正开车回家
He, uh, was driving home when he was...Killed.

329
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,100
您正在调查Bannerman的银行 而令郎还和他打交道?
You're investigating Bannerman's bank, and your son socializes with him?

330
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,500
我也不喜欢这样 但我不能控制自己儿子的社交生活
I didn't like it either, but I couldn't control my son's social life.

331
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,300
令郎当天晚上随身带着很多钱?
You son have a lot of money on him that night?

332
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
我不清楚
I have no idea.

333
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,700
这有什么关系?
Why would that be pertinent?

334
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,800
有两个人被杀了
Two people were murdered.

335
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,200
我们认为他们都在事故现场
We think they were both at the crash site.

336
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,100
我们还认为他们在车里找到了钱
We also think they found money in the car.

337
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,900
对不起 我没什么可说的
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

338
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
他在贩毒么?
Was he dealing drugs?

339
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,000
你瞧 他已经死了
Look, he's dead.

340
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
我们不能在这件事上就算了么?
Can't we just let it go at that?

341
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,700
还有另外两个人也死了 所以 不行
Two other people are dead too. So, no.

342
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
他有贩毒么?
Was he dealing?

343
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
我很担心他...
I worried that he- he-

344
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
他在做些不该做的事情
He was doing something he shouldn't be doing.

345
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,100
他在和一些
He was dealing with people

346
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,200
不该打交道的人来往
he shouldn't have been dealing with.

347
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,200
我能说的就这些了
That's all I can say about it.

348
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,900
我们得和Bannerman谈谈了
Well, we'll have to talk to Bannerman.

349
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,700
鉴于你对他所说的不能全信
As long as you take what he says to you with a grain of salt.

350
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,100
我们不是朋友
We're not friends.

351
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
我们在令郎的车里发现了一张这个
One of these were found in your son's car.

352
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
他建立的这个基金会么?
Did he set up this charity?

353
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,300
是的
Yes, he did.

354
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
我乐于这样想他
That's how I like to think of him.

355
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,300
他的善行
His good deeds.

356
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,200
离开Bannerman家后 你没有回家
You left Bannerman's house, but you weren't going home,

357
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
是吧 Jamie?
were you, Jamie?

358
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,100
这台新手机 你拿着用
Here is your new phone, okay?

359
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,500
- 谢了 你告诉妈妈了吗? - 等我们脱险后再说吧
Thanks. Did you say anything to mom? Not till I know that we're safe.

360
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
Matt出事了 知道吗?
Did you hear about that guy Matt?

361
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,500
我们被人盯上了
There's people looking for us.

362
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,400
知道不?
Okay?

363
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,000
别过来 小心挨枪子
You get back, or I will shoot you.

364
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,700
买枪前...
If you're going to buy a gun...

365
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
先得学会使枪
Make sure you know how to use it.

366
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
你来过发廊
You came to the salon.

367
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
你想怎样?
What do you want?

368
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
除理发以外吗?
You mean apart from a haircut?

369
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,700
你们俩怎么认识对方的?
How do you two know each other?

370
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,600
我们俩认识好些年了
We've known each other for years.

371
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,200
我们是一对被收养的姐妹
We're foster sisters.

372
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,700
这与你无关
Not that that's any of your business.

373
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
你们从撞毁轿车上
Guess the, uh, money you took from the crashed car

374
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,500
找到的那笔钱 也与我无关咯?
is none of my business either?

375
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,700
我们得先弄清你的来历 否则无可奉告
We're not telling you anything, till we know who you are and why you're following us.

376
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,100
- 有人在吗? - 问问他来路
Hello! Anyone at home? Find out what he wants.

377
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,600
别靠近大门
And stand away from the door.

378
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,600
你是谁?
Who is it?

379
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,900
我叫Dayne
Uh, my name is Dayne.

380
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,800
很抱歉打扰了 我小车抛锚了
I'm sorry to trouble you, but my car has just broken down.

381
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,300
抱歉 这不是修车店
I'm sorry, but this isn't a garage.

382
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,900
我知道 可我手机没电了
I know, I know, but the thing is- is my phone just died

383
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,200
孩子们吓坏了 电话能借我用用吗?
and the kids are getting kind of scared, so if I could just use your phone?

384
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,100
我会付你话费的
I- I'll pay for the call.

385
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
让他进来
Let him in.

386
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
好吧
Okay.

387
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
这是Jamie Hallen遇害的录像 
Here's how Jamie Hallen died.

388
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
从犯罪监控中心的技术人员那弄来的
I persuaded a tech at the real time crime center to copy this for me.

389
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,700
两辆轿车停在了事故现场
Two cars stopped after the crash.

390
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
中心工作人员可以识别车牌号
Crime center guys were able to read the plates.

391
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,100
前面那辆车主是Claire Ryan 跟随其后的是Matt Duggan
Prius registered to Claire Ryan, escort to Matt Duggan,

392
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,600
两人身份已经确认
so they're confirmed.

393
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,700
注意这里
But look at this.

394
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,800
- 两个女人 - 没错
- Two more women. - Mm-hmm.

395
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,100
- 身份确认了吗? - 没有
- Crime center identify them? - Nope.

396
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,200
镜头设置为最大视场
Camera's set for maximum field of view.

397
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,400
分辨率不足识别面部
Resolution's not enough for facial recognition.

398
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,800
接下来才是关键
This is where it gets interesting.

399
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
手提箱 肯定是那笔钱
Suitcase. That has to be the money.

400
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
必须先杀手一步 找到这两个女人
We got to find these girls before the killers do.

401
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,000
中心的人说 有一名探员也在找她们
Guy at the crime center said there's another detective looking for them.

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,500
82辖区的Foster探员 
Detective Foster, 82nd precinct.

403
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,100
还有别的线索吗?
We got anything else?

404
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,800
这个男人
Yeah. This guy.

405
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,700
事发约30分钟后 他打了通电话
About 30 minutes after the crash, he makes a phone call.

406
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
能监听通话内容就好了
Wish we could hear what he was saying.

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,500
可惜 这不是国家安全局
Unfortunately, we're not the NSA.

408
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,800
这肯定是新车 瞧
Vehicle must be new, 'cause look.

409
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,500
还没上牌呢
There are no plates.

410
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,700
这么一来就省事了
That's convenient.

411
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,100
想接手这个案子吗 Carter?
Want to get in some more trouble, Carter?

412
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,600
找Foster探员谈谈 看他知道什么
Go talk to Detective Foster, and see if he knows anything.

413
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
乐意效劳
Be a pleasure.

414
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,600
Finch
Finch,

415
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,900
能查查圣乔治医院的病人Susan McNally吗?
can you do a search for Susan McNally at St. George's hospital?

416
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
在查呢
I'm on it.

417
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
情况如何?
Everything all right?

418
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,100
杀手想干掉Wendy和Paula
Killers just tried to take out Wendy and Paula.

419
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,400
但愿没有成功
Please tell me they failed.

420
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
她们暂时逃过一劫
For now. Girls took off.

421
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,700
她们是一对被收养的姐妹
They're sisters, Finch. Foster sisters.

422
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,600
如果她们的养母还在圣乔治医院 我想她们会去那的
If their mom's still at St. George's, that's where I think they'll go.

423
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,900
- 养母还在那 - 她生病了吗? 所以需要那笔钱?
- Mom is still there. - So she's sick? That why the girls took the money?

424
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,500
摔了一跤 伤了屁股
Had a fall, broke her hip.

425
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
倒也不是生病
Not sick exactly.

426
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,100
她的房子才是关键
Her home is the problem.

427
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,500
按揭超出了房产价值
Mortgage is worth more than the house.

428
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,900
银行要收了这房子
Bank's foreclosing on her.

429
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
至少她们拿钱是有因的
At least they took the money for a reason.

430
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
- 查到那笔钱的主人是谁了吗? - 还在查呢
- You know whose it is yet? - I'm digging.

431
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
保证她们的安全
Keep those girls safe.

432
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Fusco 是我Carter 刚去了82辖区
Fusco, Carter. Just left the 82nd.

433
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,900
压根没有什么Foster探员
There is no Detective Foster.

434
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,000
这是障眼法 误导我们以录像作线索
Somebody used a fake detective shield to get eyes on the crash footage.

435
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
记得Claire的案子吗 ?
Remember how Claire was beaten up?

436
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,700
杀手通过车牌号找到了她 折磨她 让她招供同伙
I think the killer tracked her through her license plates, then tortured her to get the other names.

437
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,800
再聊
Call me.

438
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
有毛病啊 跟踪警察?
What's wrong with you, following a cop?

439
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,900
- 想挨枪子? - 只想确保你安全罢了 警探
Trying to get yourself shot? I'm just worried about you, Detective.

440
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
少来这套 赶紧闪人吧
Don't. Just back off, okay?

441
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,400
带上你那衣冠楚楚的朋友
You and your preppy friend over there.

442
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
找个安静的地方说两句?
Why don't we go somewhere quiet where we can talk?

443
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,900
你是中情局的人
You're CIA.

444
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,000
我在伊拉克绿区那会儿接触过不少像你这样的
I met plenty like you in the green zone.

445
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
你为什么会担心我的安全?
So why are you worried about me?

446
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,100
因为你在找那个人
Because of the man you're chasing.

447
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,000
他是个危险人物
He's dangerous.

448
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,800
他救过我一命
He saved my life.

449
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
这你怎么解释 纯属意外?
What was that, an accident?

450
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,400
只能说明他良心未泯
No. Just proves he still has good instincts.

451
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,800
- 你到底认不认识他?  - 认识
- Do you even know him? - Yeah.

452
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,500
我曾是他最好的朋友
I was his best friend.

453
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,500
那为什么还要拿下他?
Then why do you want him so bad?

454
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
因为他曾为国家卖命
Because he used to kill people for his country.

455
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,000
现在却成了杀人狂
Now he just kills them.

456
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
据我们所知 他干掉许多人
His victims... The ones that we know of.

457
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,400
有时可说是为民除害
For some he deserves a medal.

458
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,700
有时却是滥杀无辜
For some, the chair.

459
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
为什么告诉我这些?
Why are you telling me this?

460
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,600
我们要你认清他的真面目
'Cause we want you to know who he is.

461
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,700
他是个天生的杀手 头号危险人物
He's an incredibly dangerous, incredibly gifted man

462
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,300
他的职业让他痛不欲生
who's been almost destroyed by the things he was made to do.

463
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
他总想相信别人
He's always looking for someone to trust,

464
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,400
但他生性多疑 不可能信任他人
but his paranoia makes trust impossible.

465
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,100
我没听懂你的意思
I don't understand.

466
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,600
Kara Stanton是他在中情局的搭档
Kara Stanton- His CIA handler.

467
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
他们曾是一对默契搭档
They were a team.

468
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,500
合作无间 一起经历过
Inseparable, saved each other's lives

469
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,600
- 无数次出生入死 然而... - 他杀了她
- a dozen times, and then- - He killed her.

470
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,200
而后销声匿迹
Then disappeared.

471
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,600
我们以为他牺牲了
We thought he was dead.

472
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,400
为他刻上了烈士之星
Gave him his star on the wall at Langley.

473
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,100
3个月前 因为你 他死而复生
Then three months ago, you ran his prints- Brought him back from the dead.

474
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,000
我们要逮到他 以免再有杀戮
We want to bring him back in before he kills anyone else.

475
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,000
这么做也是为了保护他
Before he kills himself.

476
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,800
我们是在帮他
We want to help him.

477
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
这与我何干?
So where do I come in to all of this?

478
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,300
他信任你
We think he trusts you.

479
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,100
就像信任他昔日的同伴一样
Like he trusted her.

480
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,000
你要让你俩都活着
We want you to keep yourself, and him, alive.

481
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
谢谢合作 Bannerman先生
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Bannerman.

482
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,100
纽约警署有何新进展?
Anything for the NYPD.

483
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Jamie Hallen前晚参加了你家的派对
Jamie Hallen- He was at a party at your house, two nights ago.

484
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,200
简而言之
Briefly.

485
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
他喝醉了
He was stoned.

486
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
我把他请出了家门
I asked him to leave.

487
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,900
还替他叫了辆车
Even ordered a cab for him.

488
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,300
很遗憾 车还没到他就离开了
He left before it arrived... Sadly.

489
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,600
他在贩毒吗?
Was he dealing drugs?

490
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,500
我喜欢这孩子
Look, I liked the kid.

491
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
- 但我不想... - 他在贩毒吗?
But I don't want to- Was he dealing drugs?

492
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,100
我不清楚
I don't know.

493
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,900
但他突然间有了一大笔钱
But he seemed to have a lot of money suddenly.

494
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,900
这么跟你说吧
And, uh, let's put it like this.

495
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,100
听说他勾搭上了不该惹上的人
I heard he was dealing with some people he shouldn't.

496
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,400
我听到了 Fusco探员
I heard, Detective Fusco.

497
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,600
Bannerman的供词印证了Hallen议员的说法
Bannerman's story confirmed Congressman Hallen's.

498
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,800
他俩的说法如出一辙
Yeah, he said the same things.

499
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,900
- 这对我们毫无帮助 - 你没听明白我的意思
- So it doesn't help us. - You're not hearing me.

500
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
他和Hallen的供词一模一样
He said the same thing as Hallen.

501
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,000
凭我经验判断 他们是事先串通好的
Look, I interrogate a lot of douches, and I know when they got their lies lined up.

502
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,700
他俩事先统一口径?
They coordinated their stories?

503
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,900
他们不应该是死对头吗?
Despite the fact they're supposed to hate each other?

504
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,600
我认为Bannerman和Hallen在做交易
I think Bannerman was working something with Hallen.

505
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,800
Jamie是中间人 现在他们想跟他撇清干系
Jamie was a go-between, and now they're tossing him under the bus.

506
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Reese先生?
Mr. Reese?

507
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,300
我在医院
I'm at the hospital.

508
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,500
Wendy在这
Wendy's here.

509
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,200
Paula不见踪影
No sign of Paula.

510
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
查到什么了吗?
What do you got?

511
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,700
快了
Getting close.

512
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,200
已经查出了Jamie当天晚上的行踪 
I know where Jamie was going that night anyway.

513
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
他去了Laguardia机场 
Only as far as Laguardia airport.

514
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,500
- 他要离开这? - 没错
- Was he flying somewhere? - Yes.

515
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,400
他打算坐Davis Bannerman的私人飞机
On a jet belonging to Davis Bannerman.

516
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,700
跟联邦航空局报备是飞往开曼群岛

517

Jamie Hallen是机上唯一的乘客

518
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,600
需要帮忙吗?
Excuse me, can I help you?

519
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,400
在找人吗?
Are you looking for someone?

520
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
已经找到了 谢谢
Just found him. Thanks.

521
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
他为什么要去开曼群岛?
Why was he going to the Caymans?

522
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,000
应该是去打理他在海地的孤儿慈善基金
I believe he was working for his haitian orphans charity.

523
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
我正准备查证这一点
A theory I'm about to put to the test.

524
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,300
再联系
I'll call you.

525
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,900
- Paula在哪? - 她去买吃的了
Where's Paula? She's gone to get something to eat.

526
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,200
我们很担心你
We were worried about you.

527
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,100
他们要追杀的不是我
Wasn't me they were trying to kill.

528
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
很抱歉没有对你说实话
I'm sorry we lied to you before.

529
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,700
你到过车祸现场
You were at the crash scene.

530
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,700
告诉我究竟发生了什么吧
Want to tell me what happened?

531

目睹了车祸的经过

534
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,100
在现场帮忙
Trying to help.

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
司机死了
The, uh- The driver was dead-

536

被烧成了焦炭
Coke all over him.

537
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,800
还有一个手提箱 大概装有100万美金

538
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
年轻人开快车 毒品 现金
Young guy, fast car, cocaine, cash.

539
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,900
这笔钱肯定来路不正
I mean, the money had to be illegal.

540
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,500
你们把钱拿走了
So you took it.

541
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,800
我们把钱分了...
We divvied it up...

542
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
每人25万
250 grand each.

543
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,300
足够解决所有问题
Would have fixed everything.

544
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
那是不对的
It was wrong.

545
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,100
我们知道这么做不对
We knew it was wrong.

546
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,300
应该报警 然后离开现场的
We should have... Called 911, and walked away.

547
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,300
钱在哪?
Where's the money?

548
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,300
在母亲病床底下
It's under mom's bed in there.

549
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,600
护士以为那是她织的毛衣

550
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
值50万的毛衣

但不清楚这笔钱是谁的
But we don't know who these guys are.

553
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,500
毒贩?
Drug dealers?

554
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,600
黑手党?
Mafia?

555
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,300
你妈妈呢?
And your mom?

556
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
她房子问题怎么解决?
Her house?

557
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,100
总会有办法的
We'll find a way... Somehow.

558
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,700
是Paula打来的
Oh, that's Paula.

559
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,600
发你张照片
Just sent you a picture.

560
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,700
把钱带到停车场三层
I want you to get the money and come down to the third floor of the parking garage.

561

只许一个人来 别耍花样
Come alone- No muscle-

562
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,700
否则她小命不保
If you want your friend to live.

563
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
人找到了
Found him.

564
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,900
他死了 钱不见了
He's dead. The money's gone.

565
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,700
有摄像头 可能需要点帮助
We got cameras. Might need some help.

566
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,700
Hallen先生 这位是Thomas Paine
Mr. Hallen, this is Thomas Paine.

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,100
议员 抱歉这么急着要见您

569
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,500
请坐
Have a seat.

570
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
名字如雷贯耳啊
That's a rather famous name.

571
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,400
笔名而已
<i>Nom de plume.</i>

572
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,200

573
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,400
利用您的儿子对付您

574
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,900
利用Jamie? 此话怎讲?
They used Jamie? How?

575
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,000
勒索
Blackmail.

576

你知道他名下的海地孤儿基金吗?

知道 这是他的遗产

578
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,000
请不要这么做
I hope it won't.

579
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,500
账户名下有三千万美金
They have $30 million in that account,

580
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,300
没有一分钱用在了孤儿身上
and they've never helped a single child.

581
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,800
这很明显是个圈套
It's a classic black-arts setup.

582
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
- 设立海外账户 - 这帮人什么来历?
They open an offshore account- Who are they, for God's sake?

583
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,200
肯定是银行
The banks, of course.

584
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,200
Bannerman的党羽

账户注入资金后
They stuff it with money,

586
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,900
投到您基金的名下
they tie you to it by association,

587
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,300
事情暴光后 您的政治生涯就毁于一旦
and then they expose it and ruin you.

588
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,800
本该捍卫华尔街廉政的人
The man who's supposed to bring honesty to Wall Street

589
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
却与贪污犯同流合污
is shown to be as corrupt as those he's investigating.

590
