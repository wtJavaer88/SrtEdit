1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,490
你在被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,450
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,380
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,820
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,150
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,590
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,770
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,220
像你一样的普通人
People like you.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,590
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,220
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,900
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,840
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,040
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,960
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,960
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,900
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
If you're number's up, we'll find you.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:01:02,000
<font color="#4096d1">疑犯追踪 第1季 第13集</font>

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,630
早上好  里瑟先生
Good morning, mr. Reese.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,730
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,180
信号不太好
A bit of a bad connection.

21
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,230
你说服比利克先生
Were you able to convince mr. Billick

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,500
不要杀他的前妻了吗
to abandon his plan to kill his ex-wife?

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,040
我正在努力  芬奇
I'm working on it, Finch.

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,950
芬奇  什么事
Yeah, Finch. What is it?

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,870
这肯定违反了假释条例  泰迪
Pretty sure that's a parole violation, Teddy.

26
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,800
芬奇
Hello, Finch.

27
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,810
比利克刚跟我达成了共识
Billick and I just came to an understanding.

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,310
很好  我们又有新号码了
Good, because we have a new number.

29
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,680
我就知道你要说这个
Had a feeling you were going to say that.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,900
地址我发给你了
I'm sending you an address.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,350
到了给我个电话
Call me when you get there.

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,800
你确定就用他吗
You sure he's the right guy?

33
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,080
他再好不过
He's perfect.

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,380
这家伙有什么背景  芬奇
So what's this guy's story, Finch?

35
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,880
斯科特・鲍威尔  38岁
Scott Powell, 38.

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,870
是市里一个建筑项目的经理
He's a construction project manager for the city.

37
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,490
看来只是个居家好男人
Seems like a family man.

38
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,640
他老婆叫莱丝丽
His wife's name is Leslie.

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,920
儿子叫欧文  女儿叫米娅
Son is Owen, daughter Mia.

40
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,410
我的老天
Oh, my goodness.

41
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,540
你在画什么  一只小狗狗
What are you working on there? A doggie?

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,900
一匹马
A horse.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,150
是匹马  当然是匹马
It's a horse. Of course it's a horse.

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,430
我知道这是马  我就是考考你
I knew it was a horse. I was just testing.

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,730
你的表丢了吗
Did you lose your watch?

46
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,520
没有  就是随手放在哪了
Uh, no. It's around here somewhere.

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,490
好了  宝贝们  爸爸要去上班了
All right, guys, daddy's got to go to work.

48
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,410
-拜拜  -我爱你  宝贝
-All right. Bye. - Love you, baby.

49
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,380
-我也爱你  -走了
- You too. Be good. - All right.

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,030
你还在吗  里瑟先生
Are you still there, mr. Reese?

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,950
你向往过更平常的生活吗  芬奇
You ever crave a more conventional life, finch?

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,160
如果你的"平常"是指没有号码的生活
If by "Conventional" you mean a life without the numbers,

53
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,610
有时会想到
It has crossed my mind.

54
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,740
鲍威尔的生活看起来很平常
It looks like Powell has a pretty normal one.

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,970
我们俩的经历能证明一件事
If there's one thing our little venture has proven,

56
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,450
里瑟先生  人们从来都表里不一
mr. Reese, it's that people are rarely what they seem.

57
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,030
芬奇  鲍威尔似乎翘班了
Finch, looks like Powell's playing hooky.

58
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,120
他正走向一个公园
He's heading into a park.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,370
可能是去见人
Could be meeting somebody.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,080
你追踪到他的手机了吗
Are you up on his phone?

61
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,620
马上
I'm about to be.

62
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,270
你好
Hi, yeah.

63
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,470
我想应聘你们报纸上
Calling about the installer job you have listed

64
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,420
登的安装工人岗位
in the-- in the paper here.

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,510
很抱歉  先生  我们已经招满了
I'm sorry, sir. That position's been filled.

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,260
好吧  那你们还有
Oh. Um, well, do you have

67
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,150
什么缺人的岗位吗  或者...
any other positions available at this time? Or--

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,940
芬奇  鲍威尔没有翘班
Finch, Powell's not skipping work,

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,940
他下岗了
He's out of work.

70
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,440
是的
Yes.

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,160
我刚发现市内登记的雇员名单
I'm just discovering that the city's employee directory

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
非常旧了
is grossly out of date.

73
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,080
有一场大规模公职人员裁员
A casualty of public employee cutbacks.

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,780
这场裁员让鲍威尔丢了工作
The same cutbacks have put mr. Powell out of a job--

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,150
就在八个月前
Eight months ago.

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,790
就他和家人的互动来看
Judging by the way he was acting with his family,

77
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,840
他们还蒙在鼓里
They have no idea.

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,020
他很长时间没有薪水可领了
That's a long time to go without a paycheck.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,970
这些长笛是镀银的
These flutes are silver plated.

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,470
还是雕花的  但我觉得
And engraved. I ain't expecting

81
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,610
除了你们两口子没人要这玩意
another Leslie and Scott to come in the shop.

82
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,480
这些我都不要
Look, I can't use any of this stuff.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,710
如果你还有手表
Now, if you have another watch

84
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,230
像上次那块那样...
Like you had the last time...

85
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,230
纽约互惠银行

86
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,500
这些只要100块
I'll let you have all of it for 100 bucks.

87
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,410
-抱歉  - 50块
- Sorry. - 50.

88
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,990
老兄  快拿着你的垃圾走人吧
Look, pal, take your junk and clear out, all right?

89
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,710
不准说这些是垃圾
Don't call my stuff junk!

90
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,820
你想让我叫警察来吗
Hey, you want I should call the cops?

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,180
不
No, man.

92
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,180
芬奇  他正处于人生低谷
Finch, this guy's about ready to hit rock bottom.

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,480
我查了鲍威尔的信用卡记录
I ran Powell's credit.

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,210
他刷爆了所有信用卡
He's maxed out on every one of his cards

95
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,270
除了和他老婆共用的那张
with the exception of the one he shares with his wife.

96
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,850
但那张也快到极限了
And that's almost at its limit.

97
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,070
你觉得他是个威胁吗
You suspect he might be a threat?

98
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,450
他刚差点为了点钱把个典当商的头剁掉
He just about took a pawnbroker's head off For a few bucks.

99
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,560
看看卡特警探能查到这家伙什么资料
See if detective carter can run a background check on this guy.

100
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,390
怎么不找弗斯科警探
What about detective Fusco?

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
他现在有别的事要忙
He's handling another matter right now.

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,660
搞清楚鲍威尔在搞什么名堂之前
I'll keep a close eye on Powell

103
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,800
我都会盯紧他
until we know what we're dealing with.

104
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,920
很好  我这就去
Good. And I'm going to want

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,900
查查他的电脑
to get a look at his home computer.

106
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,480
晚上和你会合
So I'll be joining you tonight.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,180
是嘛  你以前监视过没有  芬奇
Really. Ever been on a stakeout, finch?

108
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,480
没有  我该带什么家伙吗
No. Should I bring anything?

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,180
厚外套  打发时间的书
Warm clothes, something to read,

110
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,320
-再带个空瓶子  -空瓶子

111
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,170
监视的时候可没厕所给你上  芬奇
There are no bathrooms on a stakeout, Finch.

112
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,360
他的双重生活过得挺得心应手
He's getting good at leading two lives.

113
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,750
很不幸  离露馅不远了
Unfortunately, they're on a collision course.

114
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,930
这就饿了嘛  芬奇
Hungry already, finch?

115
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,100
没有  就算我真的饿了  也不会吃
No. And if I was, it wouldn't be for something

116
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,200
加了...肌苷酸二钠[风味增强剂]的东西
with... disodium inosinate.

117
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,370
罐子是铝做的

121
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,750
他家的Wi-Fi网络有wpa密码保护

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,310
-你能黑进去吗  -刚黑完

经常浏览政治专题的网页

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,860
写了博客讨论国会议员迈克・德兰西

125
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,910
是议员先生的黑粉
Not a big fan of the congressman.

126
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,310
这里有料  这有个很大的文件夹
This is interesting. Here's a big file--

127
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,990
加密的
Encrypted.

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,250
我得接一下电话
I'm going to have to take this.

129
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,290
马上就回来
I'll be right back.

130
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,500
你好
Hello.

131
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,620

132
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,640
我是兼职中介
This is the work time temp agency.

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,340
你几周前给我们打过电话应聘宴会工作人员吗

他们要你12点半到场

139
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,570
非常感谢

140
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,970
看来鲍威尔终于时来运转了

141
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,770
希望如此

142
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,250
但我们还是没查出为什么机器给了他的号码
But we still don't know why the machine gave us his number.

143
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,870
警探
Detective?

144
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,830

148
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,170
知道了  谢谢
I see. Okay, thank you.

149
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,640
我要留心这个人吗
Should I be worried about this guy?

150
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
我们正在研究  警探
That's what we're trying to determine, detective.

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,980
鲍威尔电脑里的那个文件夹
That file from Powell's computer,

152
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,470
是个用加密软件加密过的匿名邮件账户
it was a pgp-encrypted, anonymous email account.

153
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,700
所有邮件都寄往一个地址
All these emails are addressed

154
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,790
德兰西议员的办公室
to ongressman Delancey's office.

155
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,670
是鲍威尔看不顺眼的那个议员吗
The same congressman that Powell had a beef with?

156
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,880
德兰西推行削减预算
Delancey pushed for the budgetary cutbacks

157
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,910
引起了市内的裁员
that prompted the city layoffs.

158
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,360
他让鲍威尔丢了饭碗
He cost Powell his job.

159
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,470
那鲍威尔为什么还要去德兰西的筹资宴会工作
So why would Powell be working a fundraiser for Delancey?

160
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,470
他有登记在案的武器吗
Does he own any registered weapons?

161
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,970
卡特说他申请过枪械执照
Carter said he applied for a firearms license--

162
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,090
步枪...
a rifle...

163
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,460
这些是死亡恐吓信  里瑟先生
These are death threats, mr. Reese.

164
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,050
鲍威尔来这不是为了打工
Powell's not here for a job,

165
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,170
而是来暗杀德兰西
He's going to assassinate Delancey.

166
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,950
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese

167
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,880
你找到鲍威尔了吗
Did you find Powell?

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,630
我们得在他搞定议员之前搞定他
We need to get to him before he gets to the congressman.

169
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,690
先生
Sir.

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,550
请您接受安检
You need to come through the main line.

171
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,410
谢谢
Thanks.

172
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,980
我们有了点麻烦  芬奇
We've got a problem, Finch,

173
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,330
鲍威尔已经进去了
Powell's already inside.

174
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,400
那我们也得想办法进去
We should probably get in there then.

175
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,720
你跟紧议员
You stay close to the congressman.

176
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,800
保持警惕  随时准备行动
Keep your eyes open and be ready to move.

177
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,600
什么行动  如果有人开枪
Move? If somebody starts shooting,

178
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,170
我该怎么做
what exactly do you expect me to do?

179
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,030
你得自己想办法  芬奇
You'll think of something, Finch.

180
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,280
票数不错啊  迈克
Polls look good, Mike.

181
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,110
多亏您的支持  参议员先生
Thanks to your endorsement, senator.

182
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,030
你还记得我的竞选经理彼得・马西森吗
Do you remember Pete Matheson my campaign manager?

183
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,330
当然  你干得棒极了
Sure. You're doing a hell of a job.

184
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,540
十分感谢  参议员先生  谢谢您的鼓励
Oh, thank you, senator. Thank you very much.

185
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,730
鲍威尔肯定拿着东西下楼了
Powell must be downstairs with the stuff.

186
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,880
-你还跟着德兰西吗  -很靠近
- Are you with Delancey? - Close by.

187
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,340
听着  迈克
Listen, listen, Mike.

188
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,050
如果你听得懂  我恳请你帮个忙
Uh, as long as a got you, let me ask you a favor.

189
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,060
别再说那些套话  明白吗
Back off the rhetoric, understand?

190
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,470
拍那些捐赠人的马屁确实有助于你的演说
Calling out certain large donors makes for great stumping,

191
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,640
但也让人感觉很不舒服
But it also makes people uncomfortable.

192
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,470
"人"特指你吧 
By "people," you mean you?

193
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,670
你记住我的话  议员
Just keep it in mind, congressman.

194
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,990
我们都希望你能长久坐稳你的位置
We want you to have a long, long career.

195
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,150
听着  有件事很奇怪
Listen, this is odd.

196
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,980
那些鲍威尔寄给议员的
Those threatening emails that Powell sent

197
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,070
恐吓邮件
to the congressman--

198
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,280
我正在用我自己的系统标记它们
They're being flagged by my system.

199
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,050
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

200
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,870
请就坐
We'd like you to please take your seats.

201
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,190
女士们先生们
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

202
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,690
感谢您赏光前来出席宴会
Thank you for joining us this afternoon.

203
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,160
我是彼得・马西森
I'm Pete Matheson.

204
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,910
几年前
You know, a few years back,

205
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,550
我的好朋友兼生意伙伴来找我  说
My friend and business partner came to me and said,

206
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,650
"我想参加竞选"
"Hey, I'm thinking of running for office."

207
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,500
...很受欢迎
...Popular,

208
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,210
我们都认为他们一直以来...
I think we can all agree that they have always been...

209
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,680
IP地址没有问题
The IP addresses match,

210
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,060
但TTL值完全不对
but there are big discrepancies in the TTL values,

211
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,100
数据头也无法通过验证
And the headers are failing to authenticate.

212
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,560
你说什么呢  芬奇
What are you getting at, Finch?

213
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,350
那些匿名邮件
Those anonymous emails didn't originate

214
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,730
不是从鲍威尔的笔记本发出
in Powell's laptop.

215
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,390
而是从一个远端位置复制过去
They were copied onto it from a remote location.

216
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,740
芬奇  比起纠结这位持枪歹徒的电脑
Finch, I'm more interested in finding the guy with the gun

217
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,160
我更想赶快找到他的人
than I am in fixing his computer.

218
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,110
迈克・德兰西议员
Congressman Michael Delancey.

219
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,230
谢谢  感谢各位今天的光临
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming.

220
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,250
也谢谢你
And thank you too.

221
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,910
我认为他的系统被人黑过
I think his system's been hacked.

222
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,800
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

223
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,260
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

224
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,080
-彩色纸屑  -我认为鲍威尔被陷害了
- Confetti? - I think Powell's being set up.

225
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,830
他在那儿  在那儿
There he is! There!

226
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,690
在露台上
In the balcony!

227
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,810
我不知道议员伤势如何
I can't tell how badly the congressman is wounded.

228
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,200
我也跟丢了杀手
Yeah, I lost the real shooter.

229
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,650
电邮  工作  鲍威尔被陷害了
The emails, the job-- Powell was set up.

230
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,440
听我说  不是我
Listen to me! It wasn't me!

231
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,950
我什么也没干
I didn't do anything!

232
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
你们为什么不听我说
Why won't you listen to me?

233
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,540
问题是  谁陷害了他
The question is, by who?

234
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,980
这真是令人震惊和悲痛
This is a shocking and a tragic day.

235
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,070
我们都在祈祷他能撑过去
We're all just praying that he'll pull through.

236
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,200
就这些
That's--that's all.

237
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,750
无论是谁枪击了德兰西议员
Whoever shot Congressman Delancey

238
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,900
并陷害了鲍威尔  他们费了一番功夫
and framed Powell went to a lot of trouble.

239
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,520
他们必须侵入他的电脑
They had to hack his computer,

240
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,200
伪造他的网络搜索记录和电邮
They spoofed his internet search history and emails.

241
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,580
他们很清楚要篡改什么信息
They knew exactly what information to manipulate

242
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,540
能让警察以为他有罪
so that he looked guilty to the police.

243
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,850
也骗过了我们  和你的机器
Fooled us... and your machine.

244
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,350
不  机器不会被骗
No, the machine doesn't get fooled.

245
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,120
如果鲍威尔不是威胁  那他肯定有危险
If Powell isn't the threat, then he must be in danger.

246
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,730
他是替罪羊
Well, he's the patsy then.

247
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,400
也许他本不该从筹款会生还
Maybe he wasn't supposed to make it out of the fundraiser alive.

248
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,580
你看到枪手了吗
Did you get a look at the shooter?

249
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,160
身手不算好  不过他是个职业杀手
Not a good one. But he was a pro.

250
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,270
枪法准  有预定逃跑路线
Deadeye shot with a preplanned escape route.

251
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,370
跟我们的黑客技能有别  所以
Different skill set than our hacker, so...

252
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,920
不同的人
Different people?

253
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,430
我们面对的是个团队
We're looking at a team.

254
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,280
首先要弄清楚
First thing to determine

255
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,880
黑客是怎么入侵他电脑的
is how the hacker got into his computer.

256
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,950
可能要花一点时间
This may take me a little time.

257
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,450
我看下鲍威尔的情况
I'll check on Powell.

258
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,740
你  我还以为能相信你
You. I thought I could trust you.

259
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,150
你家那位还要我不用担心鲍威尔
Your partner said I shouldn't worry about Powell.

260
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,970
结果他枪击了一名议员
Then he goes and shoots a congressman.

261
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,410
现在联邦特工把他带到我的管区了
And now the feds brought him in to my precinct.

262
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,310
不是他干的  我当时在场
He didn't do it. I was there.

263
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,280
我们有整个宴会厅的目击证人
Well, we got a banquet hall full of witnesses

264
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,150
-持不同意见  -好吧  他被陷害了
- saying otherwise. - Right. Well, he was set up.

265
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,330
-被陷害  谁陷害的  -还不清楚
- Set up? By who? - We don't know yet.

266
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,340
不过我们需要帮助
But we could use some help.

267
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,000
我基本上也无能为力
There's not much I can do.

268
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,050
联邦特工全权负责此案
The feds are running this show.

269
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,660
他们现在正在审讯他
They're taking him into interrogation now.

270
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,830
我得知道他们在说什么
I need to know what they're saying.

271
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,830
我说过了  我无能为力
I told you, there's nothing I can do.

272
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,690
卡特  这是在救一个无辜的人
Carter, it could help save an innocent man.

273
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,340
我没有开枪
I didn't shoot anyone.

274
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,170
这是现场发现的你的步枪
It was your rifle found at the scene.

275
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,760
我根本没有步枪
I don't own a rifle!

276
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,890
是用你的名字登记的
It's registered in your name.

277
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,100
-肯定是那个人  -哪个人
- It must have been the guy. - Uh, which guy exactly?

278
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,350
你说攻击你的那个  还是在那里工作的那个
The one you say attacked you? Or the who worked there.

279
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,150
不  是那个  那个在那里工作的人
No, the guy who--who-- who worked there

280
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,190
是他带我去包厢准备彩纸炮的
who took me up to the balcony to rig the confetti cannon.

281
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,830
没人看到过那人
No one on the staff saw this guy.

282
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,860
所有的监控录相上都没有
And he's not in any security footage.

283
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,950
他就在那里
He was right there.

284
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,700
我看到他了
I saw him.

285
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,580
他肯定是知道摄像头位置
He must have known where the cameras were.

286
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,840
整件事都是个陷阱
This whole thing is a setup.

287
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
你们给人力中介打电话了吗
Did you call the staffing agency?

288
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,170
三州区域根本没有任何一家
There's no record of any company named Work Time

289
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,260
叫"工作时间"的公司
in the tristate area.

290
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,220
这不可能  他们打电话给我了
That's impossible. They called me.

291
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,710
你的手套呢
What about your gloves?

292
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,730
为什么上面验出枪弹残留
Why'd they test positive for gunshot residue?

293
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,430
我不知道  是那个人给我的
I don't know. I got them from the guy.

294
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
是啊是啊  那个人
Right, right. The guy.

295
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,970
你还在吗
You still there?

296
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,950
在  怎么了
Yeah. What happened?

297
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,450
医院打电话来了
Hospital just called.

298
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,830
德兰西议员没能挺过去
Congressman Delancey didn't make it.

299
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,930
鲍威尔面临一级谋杀指控
Powell's looking at murder one.

300
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,920
莱丝  是我
Les, it's me.

301
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,800
我的上帝  斯科特  你在哪儿
Oh, my God, Scott, where are you?

302
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,590
这是个天大的误会
It's all a big mistake.

303
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,840
FBI正在搜查我们的房子
The FBI is searching the house.

304
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,790
-新闻说你枪杀了一个人  -不  听我说
- The news says you shot someone. - No, listen.

305
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,600
他们说的都是谎言  莱丝丽
These things they're saying, Leslie, they're all lies.

306
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,300
-不是真的  孩子们跟你在一起吗  -在
- No. Are the kids with you? - Yes.

307
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,320
我想你把他们带到一边  好吗
I want you to take them next door, okay?

308
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,180
-好的  -听我说
- Okay. - Now, listen.

309
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,270
他们可能会要你跟他们走
They're probably going to ask you to go with them

310
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,530
问你一些问题
and answer some questions.

311
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,830
莱丝丽  听我说
Now, Leslie-- Leslie, listen to me.

312
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,310
按他们的要求做  明白吗
You do what they ask, okay?

313
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,290
明白
Okay.

314
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,950
你还有台电脑吗
You have another computer?

315
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,510
没有  什么电脑
No. Wh--what computer?

316
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,420
-怎么回事  斯科特  -我不知道
- What's going on, Scott? - I don't know.

317
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,600
我需要你相信我  好吗
I need you to trust me, okay?

318
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,480
一切都会好起来的
Everything's going to be all right.

319
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,940
我爱你
I love you.

320
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,370
我也爱你
I love you too.

321
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,250
怎么了
What is it?

322
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,160
我认为鲍威尔仍然有危险
I think Powell could still be in danger.

323
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,530
什么危险
How so?

324
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,120
栽赃陷害这档子事  被陷害人通常都活不了
In frame jobs, the decoy usually doesn't make it.

325
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,560
如果他们现场没搞定
If they're not taken out at the scene,

326
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,170
之后也要马上补救
They're eliminated soon after...

327
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,960
弄成自杀或是意外的样子
Staged to look like a suicide or accident.

328
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,560
这是你的经验之谈吗  里瑟先生
Are you speaking from experience, Mr. Reese?

329
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,330
重点是解决未解决的问题
Point is it ties up the loose ends.

330
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,630
有了  我想我有办法找到那黑客了
Here. I think I may have found a way to our hacker.

331
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
什么办法
How?

332
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,090
一个木马程序  藏在鲍威尔的电邮里
A Trojan Horse...hidden in one of Powell's emails.

333
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,810
招聘会邀请
Invitation to a job fair?

334
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,640
鲍威尔一回复  木马就安装上了
When Powell rsvped, the Trojan was installed.

335
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,010
会在他电脑上打开一个端口供黑客出入
It opened a port on his computer that allowed the hacker access.

336
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,050
我现在安装一个同样的木马
I'm now installing that same Trojan.

337
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,550
你蓄意感染自己的电脑
You purposely infected your own computer?

338
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,690
不是  我构建一个虚拟系统
No, I created a virtual system.

339
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,590
现在木马还在运行  我们可以看它引向何方
Now the Trojan can still run, and we can see where it leads.

340
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,660
-那名黑客那里  -没错
- Back to the hacker. - Yes.

341
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,360
代码相当复杂
Wow. The coding is so complex.

342
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,080
非常聪明
It's really clever.

343
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,120
不过还不够聪明  我们连接上了
But not clever enough-- we're connected.

344
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,740
能拿到地址吗
Can you get their location?

345
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,250
不行  IP地址伪装过了
No, the IP address is masked.

346
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,740
不过我们能看到他们在看什么
But we can see what they're looking at.

347
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,430
好像是建筑的平面图
Looks like a floor plan.

348
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,210
芬奇  这是市中心的联邦法院
Finch, that's a federal courthouse downtown.

349
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,850
卡特说联调局现在
Carter said the FBI was now running

350
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,440
全权负责鲍威尔一案
the Powell investigation.

351
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,270
如果你真认为鲍威尔是无辜的
If you really think Powell is innocent

352
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,300
就得快点弄到证据了
you need to come up with some evidence fast.

353
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,470
-他还在你局里吗  -之前在
- Is he still in your custody? - He was.

354
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,810
-联邦探员把他带走了  -要带到哪里
- The feds have him. - Where are they taking him?

355
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,260
法院  明天传讯
The courthouse, for arraignment tomorrow.

356
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,150
-为什么问这个  你想干什么  -谢了
- Why? What are you thinking? - Thanks.

357
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,940
鲍威尔在FBI手上
The FBI's got Powell.

358
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,570
他们根本不知道这是把他
They have no idea they're dropping him off

359
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,150
往杀手手里送
into the hands of the assassins.

360
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,210
我能做什么
What can I do?

361
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,370
把第八分局到法院之间
Send me the most direct route

362
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,510
最短路线发给我
from the eighth precinct to the courthouse.

363
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,700
正在办
I'm doing it now.

364
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
小心  小心
Watch out! Watch out!

365
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,450
是你阻止了我  你是谁
You're the guy who tackled me. Who are you?

366
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,670
唯一知道你无辜的人
One of the only people who know you're innocent.

367
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,800
你想要怎么样
What do you want?

368
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,550
现在  把你送到安全的地方
Right now, to get you to someplace safe.

369
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,520
安全
Safe?

370
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,520
你从FBI手里绑架了我
You just kidnapped me from the FBI.

371
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,010
说吧  芬奇  鲍威尔在我这里
Go ahead, Finch. I've got Powell.

372
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,740
我还没办法解码黑客的IP地址
I haven't been able to unmask the hacker's IP.

373
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,670
不过防火墙有个弱点
But here's a vulnerability in the firewall.

374
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,820
成功
Yes.

375
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,330
好了  我们进去了
Okay, now we're in.

376
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,690
就知道你能行
Never doubted you.

377
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,460
现在  看看藏在幕后的是谁
Now let's see who's behind the curtain.

378
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,100
等等  不对劲
Wait, something's wrong.

379
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,440
怎么了
What is it?

380
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,510
我们没进去  是被放进去了
We didn't hack in, we were let in.

381
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,800
那是诱饵
It's a honeypot.

382
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,900
程序非常复杂
Program is sophisticated.

383
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,010
他们用蠕虫
They're using a worm

384
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,000
感染了连接我们专用网络的全部设备
to infect any devices connected to our private network.

385
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,350
包括我们的手机
Including our phones.

386
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,670
他们现在能听到我们说话
They're listening to us right now.

387
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,460
-毁掉你的手机  -等等
- Destroy your phone. - Wait.

388
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,810
你知道怎么找到我
You know how to find me.

389
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,250
你是谁
Who are you?

390
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,630
这个我要了
I'll take this one.

391
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,100
零钱不用找
Keep the change.

392
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,270
212-555-0159
212  555  0159

393
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,400
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

394
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,470
给  带上
Here. Put this on.

395
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,640
你现在是全纽约的最大通缉犯
You're the most wanted man in New York.

396
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,000
212-555-0159
212  555  0159

397
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,760
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese.

398
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
芬奇  到底是怎么回事
Finch, what the hell happened?

399
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,410
恐怕我低估了那个黑客
I'm afraid I underestimated our hacker.

400
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,000
因此
As a consequence,

401
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,130
我在图书馆的设备被暴露了
my equipment at the library is compromised.

402
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,250
所以暂时  我只能机动行事
So for the time being, I'm mobile.

403
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,860
我觉得我们现在需要额外帮助
Listen, I felt like we might need a little extra help

404
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,790
以追查杀死德兰西议员的凶手
looking for Congressman Delancey's killer,

405
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,670
所以我打给了一位专家
So I've called in a specialist--

406
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,540
一位对政治领域有深入了解的人
Someone with an intimate knowledge of the political arena.

407
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,300
她来了  失陪
Oh, here she is. I have to go.

408
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,310
等等  什么专家  还是女的
Wait a minute. Specialist? She?

409
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,710
芬奇
Finch?

410
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,640
这房间我预定了
Hey, I reserved the room.

411
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,010
课间休息一下
Take a study break.

412
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,860
有你的  老兄
Nice work, dude.

413
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,380
请
Please.

414
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,970
感谢您这么急赶过来  摩根女士
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice, Ms. Morgan.

415
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,150
有人需要时我就工作  您是
I work when I'm needed, Mr.--

416
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,660
请叫我哈罗德
Harold-- please.

417
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,830
我有点好奇您如何拿到我的号码
I am curious how you got my number.

418
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,740
共同的朋友那里  他帮过你
Mutual friend. He assisted you on a...

419
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,350
跟某家制药公司进行过  微妙的谈判
delicate negotiation with a certain pharmaceutical company.

420
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,720
原来你就是电话里的那个人
So you're the guy on the other end of the phone.

421
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,840
约翰最近如何
How is John?

422
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,710
在外奔波  一如既往
On the run, as usual.

423
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,540
即使是现在  他也还在
He's actually helping another one of our clients

424
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,080
帮我们的一名客户
even as we speak.

425
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,570
正如他之前能帮助你一样
And, in the same way that he was able to assist you,

426
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,400
我们希望您能回报一下
we were hoping that you might be able to return the favor.

427
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,450
我不明白
I don't understand.

428
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,920
一个人当着你们所有人的面把我丈夫带走了
One man took my husband away from all of you?

429
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,590
我们相信他是某武装团伙的一员
We believe he's part of an armed group--

430
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,140
可能是恐怖分子
possibly terrorists.

431
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,490
您丈夫是否有某些
Did your husband have any...

432
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,880
激进的政治观点  鲍威尔夫人
radical political views, Mrs. Powell?

433
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,140
恐怖分子  不
Terrorists? No.

434
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,490
斯科特不可能跟这类事情有关
Scott would never be involved in anything like that.

435
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,380
你要是不相信我  就去问他的朋友  同事
If you don't believe me, ask his friends, his coworkers.

436
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,420
您不知道您丈夫已经失业
You do know that your husband's been out of work

437
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,060
八个月了吗
for the past eight months?

438
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,290
不可能  斯科特每天都去上班
No. Scott goes to work every day.

439
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,730
您最近看过自己的财产情况吗
Have you taken a look at your finances recently?

440
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,200
很明显  您并没有自己以为地那么
It seems pretty clear that you don't know your husband

441
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,110
了解您的丈夫  鲍威尔夫人
as well as you think, Mrs. Powell.

442
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,280
我们的客户之前在德兰西的筹款会上
Our client was at Congressman Delancey's fundraiser.

443
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,490
-是客人吗  -是那个枪手
- As a guest? - The shooter.

444
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,140
他是被陷害的
He was framed.

445
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,120
我们正在找真正的凶手
We're looking for the actual shooter.

446
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,060
你们两个还真喜欢挑战  不是吗
Well, you boys certainly do like a challenge, don't you?

447
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,100
我已经列出了可能的嫌犯名单
I've come up with a list of alternative suspects--

448
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,890
想要议员死的人
people who might have wanted the congressman dead.

449
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,400
这些人之间的关系
Well, all of these people have been

450
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,350
都紧张地要置对方于死地
at each other's throats at some point.

451
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,210
杀死德兰西的人  肯定不只是为了政治
Whoever killed Delancey, it goes way beyond politics.

452
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,370
在竞选之前
Prior to running for office,

453
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,600
德兰西有一家承包公司
Delancey owned a contracting company.

454
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,160
地方检察官已经秘密准备了几个月
D.A.'s office has quietly been preparing an investigation

455
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,240
想要调查这间公司
into the company for several months.

456
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,600
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

457
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,750
-当我没说  -有各种关于检查员
- Never mind. - There were allegations of corner cutting

458
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,210
吃回扣和受贿的指控
and payoffs to city inspectors.

459
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,780
德兰西做生意的方式还真奇怪
Strange way for Delancey to run his business,

460
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,730
考虑到他的反腐败立场
Considering his anti-corruption platform.

461
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,430
确实
It is.

462
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,610
但他并不实际掌控生意
But he wasn't running the business.

463
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,320
-是马西森  -德兰西的竞选总经理
- Matheson -- Delancey's campaign manager.

464
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,790
外加他的生意伙伴
And business partner.

465
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,560
两年来
For two years,

466
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,730
德兰西一直专心竞选
Delancey is in full-time campaign mode--

467
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,970
没什么精力来打理企业的日常事务
Not really running the day-to-day of his business.

468
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,990
那么回扣跟贿赂就
So the bribes and the corner cutting--

469
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,530
肯定是在马西森任下出现
They must have happened under Matheson's watch.

470
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,480
除非他能抹黑德兰西
Unless he could say Delancey was really running things.

471
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,330
而且现在德兰西都死了  没法为自己辩护了
Which he could if Delancey wasn't around to defend himself.

472
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,980
就算这些都是事实
Even if this was true,

473
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,680
我们也没有证据证明是马西森杀了德兰西
We have no proof that Matheson had Delancey killed.

474
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,870
去搞证据不就完了
Let's go get some.

475
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,140
不好意思  借过
Excuse me, sorry.

476
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,040
为什么你丈夫要这么做
Why'd your husband do this?

477
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,740
抱歉我  求你们了
I'm sorry. Just--just please.

478
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,140
议员是他杀的么
Did he really kill him?

479
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,320
我想不通
I don't get it.

480
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,970
为什么有人会对我做这种事情
Why would anyone want to do this to me?

481
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,610
他们要个替罪羊  你正好合适
They needed a patsy. And you fit the role.

482
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,070
他们
They?

483
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,870
谁是他们
Who's they?

484
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,260
抓紧  我们走
Come on. Let's go!

485
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,780
我们都表示沉痛哀悼
We're all feeling terrible...

486
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,990
确保所有人能想呆多久就呆多久
Just make sure that everybody can stay as long as they want.

487
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,320
我必须得会办公室去了  好么
I just got to get back to the office, okay?

488
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,430
好  好
Okay, good.

489
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,830
打扰了
Excuse me.

490
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,870
-马西森先生  -我很遗憾
- Mr. Matheson.  - Look, I'm sorry.

491
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,010
-我已经说过了  -我不是记者
- I've said everything-- - I'm not a reporter.

492
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,900
我名叫佐伊・摩根
My name is Zoe Morgan.

493
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,670
我帮过你的朋友  杰・泰纳  就在去年
I helped a friend of yours-- Jay Tanner--last year.

494
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,580
父子纠纷那件案子
Little matter of a paternity suit.

495
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,460
想起来了  不过我确信
Oh, yes, well, I'm sure we don't need

496
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,020
这里不需要你的服务  谢谢
Those services right now, thank you.

497
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,760
父子纠纷并不是我的强项
Paternity suits aren't my specialty.

498
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,210
危机处理才是
Crisis management is.

499
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,480
而现在  我觉得正是你要的
And right now, I think that's exactly what you need.

500
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,790
行
All right.

501
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,320
行  摩根女士  你倒是跟我说说我为什么要你的服务
All right, Ms. Morgan, why don't you tell me why I need you.

502
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,090
一  你即将面临的
One-- your impending investigation

503
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,210
来自地检官的调查
With the D.A.'s office.

504
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,860
-我这方面有律师照应  -二
- I have lawyers on retainer. - Two--

505
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,570
杀害你的生意伙伴
The killing of your business partner--

506
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,030
国会议员德兰西
Congressman Delancey.

507
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,280
什么
Excuse me?

508
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,950
德兰西有可能出面做证
Delancey would have testified that you were the one

509
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,350
是你搞的开后门和贿赂
Behind the shortcuts and payoffs.

510
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,540
现在他死了  你就能栽赃给他了
Now that he's dead, you can lay the blame on him.

511
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,390
你特么以为你自己是谁啊
Who the hell do you think you are?

512
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,840
你搭档要坑了你  你就先下手为强
Your partner was going to burn you, so you burned him first.

513
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,850
我懂  但是你雇来的人呢
I get it. But your vendor?

514
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,480
你雇来的人搞砸了
Your vendor dropped the ball.

515
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,300
你找来背黑锅的人已经蒸发了
The man that you set up is missing-in-action.

516
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,900
我说  如果你想做坏事
You know, if you're going to do something wrong,

517
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,660
那就好好做
Do it right.

518
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,780
我能找到鲍威尔
I can find Powell.

519
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,550
把他交给你或者任何你指定的人
Bring him to you or whomever you like.

520
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,440
当然是要收费的
For a price, of course.

521
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,540
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what you're referring to.

522
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,760
但你最好现在就走开
And I think it's time that you leave.

523
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,330
留着名片吧
Keep the card.

524
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,530
没准就能用上
Might come in handy.

525
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,220
我已经跟你讲的很清楚了
I thought I was clear on how this works--

526
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,490
单向联系  不是你来找我
I call you, not the other way around.

527
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,990
我雇你是因为我觉得你能搞定
I hired you because I thought you could handle this.

528
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,040
我确实搞的定
And I am.

529
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,860
那怎么那鲍威尔还活着
Then why is Powell still alive?

530
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,450
你跟我保证过你的能力
You assured me of your abilities.

531
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,210
而现在  我连个屁都没看见
And right now, I'm not seeing any of them.

532
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,970
我能截留你的一切电子邮件
I could have every email you've sent,

533
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,560
一切联系人  一切密码
Contact you've called and password you've used.

534
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,970
我能掏空你的银行账户
I could empty your bank accounts,

535
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,480
套现你的股票  还能给你的前妻
Liquidate your stocks, and even send your ex-wife

536
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,800
发你那百慕大豪宅的地址
The location of your house in Bermuda.

537
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,180
行  够了  够了  算你厉害
All right, stop it, stop it. You've made your point.

538
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,520
鲍威尔和他的朋友我会搞定
Powell and his friend will be taken care of.

539
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,420
你只要去给我准备好尾款就行了
You just make sure to have my final payment ready.

540
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,910
你在哪
Where are you?

541
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,260
我在去市中心
I'm headed downtown.

542
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,800
客户开始紧张了
The client's getting nervous.

543
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,770
他们刚在23街和8道交汇口附近上了地铁
They just dropped into the subway at 23rd and 8th.

544
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,810
收到
Got it.

545
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,850
这是个发信机
It's a transmitter.

546
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,830
刚才旅馆那人就是这么追踪过来的
That's how the guy at the hotel found us.

547
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,570
可能是今天刚装上的
Could have planted it today,

548
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,070
也可能更早
Maybe sometime earlier.

549
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,380
没准是在你家装的
Probably at your house.

550
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,490
他们还去过我家
They've been to my house?

551
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,990
很明显幕后黑手做的滴水不漏
Whoever is behind this left little to chance.

552
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,630
但现在我要你专注  斯科特
But I need you to stay focused, Scott,

553
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,990
这样我才能把你安全带回家
So I can get you back to your family.

554
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,320
我很怀疑我现在还有没有家可回
I doubt I got a family to go back to right now.

555
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,040
我知道你没了工作
I know about your job.

556
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,650
我知道你很拮据  还有你的谎言
I know about the money, the lies.

557
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,850
对  我知道这就像生活在谎言中一样
Yeah, I know what it's like to live inside a lie.

558
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,030
我就这么过了很久
I've lived there for so long,

559
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,870
觉得都已经没有出路了
It feels like there's no way out.

560
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,990
但事实是有的
But there always is.

561
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,610
我只要一点点的时间  明白吗
I just needed a little more time, you know.

562
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,900
找个工作  重新振作
To get a job, to get on my feet.

563
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,390
我原本打算告诉莱丝丽
I was going to tell Leslie.

564
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,830
但现在一切都晚了
But now it's too late.

565
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,970
还不算晚
No, it's not.

566
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,940
我们会帮你脱离困境
We're going to get you out of this.

567
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,750
那些人
These people...

568
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,960
他们连国会议员都杀
They killed a Congressman.

569
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,440
你还能跟我保证他们不会杀我吗
Are you going to promise me that they won't kill us too?

570
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,640
我可不这么想
I didn't think so.

571
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,740
我要跟我老婆打电话  就现在
I need to talk to my wife. Now.

572
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,470
没可能  现在不行
That's not possible. Not right now.

573
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,670
我们得小心低调
We need to keep our heads down.

574
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,820
我会死的
I could die.

575
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,910
而我一生中最爱的那个人
And--and the person who I love most in life

576
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,550
会以为我不过是一个杀手
Would think that I'm nothing more than a killer.

577
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,400
你知不知道那会有多痛苦
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

578
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,390
其实  我知道
Actually, I do.

579
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,310
当然  就我来说
Of course, in my case,

580
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,850
我的确是个杀手
It was true.

581
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,310
现在  赶紧  我们走
Now, come on, let's go.

582
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,940
请勿靠近门口
Stand away from the door.

583
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:10,740
我是卡特
Carter.

584
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,130
你好 警探
Hello, Detective.

585
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,090
你特么的在想什么
What the hell were you thinking...

586
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,380
武装劫囚
Taking down a prisoner transfer?

587
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,060
管用就行  听好  我要你帮忙
It worked. Listen, I need a favor.

588
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,150
鲍威尔想跟他老婆说话
Powell needs to talk to his wife.

589
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,710
-就现在  -你疯了
 - Now.  - Are you crazy?

590
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,260
你明知道联调局在监听她的电话
You know the feds are up on her phone.

591
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,610
他很需要  卡特
He needs this, Carter.

592
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,200
鲍威尔夫人
Mrs. Powell.

593
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,640
你是不是把你的孩子留给邻居照顾了
Did you leave your kids with your neighbor?

594
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,940
是的  出什么事了么
Yes. Is something wrong?

595
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,730
没有  他们打电话过来报平安
No, uh, they're just calling to check in.

596
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,720
跟我来
Follow me.

597
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,620
喂
Hello?

598
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,600
莱丝丽  是我
Hi, Leslie. Hi. It's me.

599
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,880
斯科特  你在哪
Scott? Where are you?

600
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,250
我很好  听我说
I'm okay. Listen...

601
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,060
莱丝丽  我是真的  真的很抱歉
Leslie, I'm really, really sorry.

602
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,680
老天啊  斯科特  是你开的枪吗
Oh, my god, Scott, did you shoot that man?

603
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,240
不  不  当然不是我
No, no, of course not.

604
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,280
-这你可得相信我  莱丝丽  -我还信
 - You got to believe me, Les.  - Do I?

605
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,770
你不上班都有八个月了  S斯科特
You've been out of work for eight months, Scott.

606
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,460
你每天早上都去干什么了
What have you been doing every morning?

607
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,050
找工作  到处都找遍了
Looking for work-- anywhere and everywhere.

608
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,050
那我们的信用卡呢  储蓄呢
And our credit cards? Our savings?

609
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,480
我知道  宝贝  我知道
I know, babe, I know.

610
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,250
为什么  斯科特
Why, scott?

611
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,330
因为我不能
Because I couldn't...

612
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,840
我没法告诉你我被炒了
I couldn't tell you that I was fired.

613
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,710
我以为我们之间无话不谈的
I thought we told each other everything.

614
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,510
我知道  听着  莱丝丽
I know. Listen, Leslie,

615
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,630
我会把这事搞定  我保证
I'm going to make this right, I promise.

616
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,900
剩下的你还是当面跟她讲吧
You can tell her the rest in person.

617
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,690
我们要走了
We need to move now.

618
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,240
我得走了  我爱你
I gotta go. I love you.

619
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,330
斯科特
Scott?

620
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,210
打扰下  我叫S鲍威尔
Excuse me. My name is Scott Powell.

621
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,110
站住  不许动
Stay where you are! Do not turn around!

622
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,240
举起手来
Raise your hands!

623
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,840
-车子在等我们  -收到
- Transport's waiting on us. - You got it.

624
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,660
都解决了
Is it finished?

625
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,130
还差一点
Not quite.

626
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,950
不过我想很快了
But I suspect it will be soon.

627
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,880
看邮箱

628
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,850
我雇你
I hired you

629
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,800
是因为我觉得你能搞定
Because I thought you could handle this.

630
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,360
我确实搞的定
And I am.

631
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,540
那怎么那鲍威尔还活着
Then why is Powell still alive?

632
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,550
你跟我保证过你的能力
You assured me of your abilities.

633
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,030
而现在  我连个屁都没看见
And right now, I'm not seeing any of them.

634
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,520
吾友如晤:
事既至此某实罪过  囹圄愧疚实难以表
彼得・马西森

635
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,440
他来了
There he is!

636
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,940
好了  朋友们都合作点  麻烦退后
All right, folks, get back, please.

637
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,310
- 先生  能谈谈吗  -回家开心吗
 - Sir--Can you make a statement? - Glad to be home, sir?

638
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,130
鲍威尔先生  回到家的感觉怎么样  
Hey, Mr. Powell, what's it like to be home, sir?

639
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,260
-回家开心吗  -你有被威胁过么
- Glad to be home? - Did you get any threats?

640
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,650
你接下来会怎么应对这些事情
What are you going to do in reaction to this?

641
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,510
-佐伊  -约翰
- Zoe. - John.

642
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,220
我听说能抓到马西森还得多亏了你
I hear we have you to thank for catching Matheson.

643
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,540
乐意效劳
Glad I could help.

644
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,120
不过薪酬问题还是得讨论一下
Although there is a matter of payment.

645
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,750
请我喝一杯
Buy me a drink?

646
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,890
你想念你的妻子吗
Did you miss your wife?

647
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,400
当然想了
Of course I missed my wife.

648
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,460
你跟我说过有个人只说了两个字
You once told me a story about a guy who could say two words

649
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,460
就打发走了那些记者
That would make the reporters go away.

650
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,990
就是想知道是哪两个字
Ever figure out what he said?

651
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,710
你想念你的妻子吗
Did you miss your wife?

652
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,340
我看到了鲍威尔先生被释放的消息
I see that Mr. Powell has been released.

653
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,740
他前面的路还长着呢
Still has a long road ahead of him, though.

654
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,770
确实
Indeed.

655
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,540
但是我认为他很快就能回归正轨
But I suspect that soon he'll be on his way back.

656
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,460
我掌握的一个公司正准备
I control a company that's decided

657
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,380
在纽约建个新设施
To build a new facility in New York.

658
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,100
他们倒需要鲍威尔这样的人来管事
They could use a man like Powell overseeing things.

659
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,860
你可真高尚  芬奇
That's noble of you, Finch.

660
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,330
谈不上  我只是欣赏好人  里瑟先生
Hardly. I just value good people, Mr. Reese.

661
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,790
那个黑客有进展么
You follow up on the hacker?

662
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,450
她似乎跟你有的一拼  滑得很
She seems to cover her tracks as efficiently as you do.

663
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,150
我倒是追踪到了一个地址
I was able to trace the signal to an address

664
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,900
然后匿名知会了联调局
Which the FBI received by way of an... anonymous tip.

665
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,470
遗憾的是  他们还是晚了
Sadly, they were too late.

666
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,660
目前看来是黑客用的是一名毫不知情的
It seems the hacker was using the dorm room

667
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,360
女大学生所用的寝室
Of an unsuspecting college student

668
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,200
她寒假回家去了
Who had been on winter break.

669
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,240
我要去评估我的系统损失
I need to determine the damage to my system.

670
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,360
再有号码出来的时候我会来找你
I'll contact you when another number comes up.

671
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,170
保重  芬奇
Take care, Finch.

672
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,920
你好
联调局走访了我  不过幸亏我没什么行李

673
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,500
你是谁

674
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,250
我的名字  我有很多  你叫我根好了

675
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,190
是你杀了马西森

676
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,420
马西森的死是他自己的软弱害的

677
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,530
你为什么联系我

678
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,480
我想来承认你这个合格的对手

679
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,120
并表示我很期待下一次

680
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,910
下一次
"Next time."

681
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,880
哈罗德

682
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,640
连线终止
