00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,620
你正被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,670
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,430
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,280
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because I built it.

我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,690
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything...

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,570
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,910
像你一样的普通人
people like you,

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,790
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,910
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,740
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,290
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,570
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,570
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,890
但不管是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,670
只要你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你

我肯定我对桌那家伙不干净

我会盯着他的

我需要知道更多  约翰

90
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,300

100
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,780
我们是不是应该告诉她

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,870
他是在我们的命令下为HR做事的

越少人知道弗斯科的事情
The less people who know about Fusco,

106
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,810
他就越安全
the less danger he's in.

还有一名看守  就是你

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,560
-想我了  -想死了
- Did you miss me? - More than you know.

155
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,760
-替我盯着点  大英雄  -有发现
- Watch my back, hero. - Found something.

156
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,200
有个车牌号今天出现了三次
One plate comes up three times today.

157
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,720
的确有人在跟踪押运车
Someone's following the truck.

158
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,020
我发现有人带着枪过来了
I got guys headed this way with guns.

159
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,980
-在东南角  -快快快快
- Southeast corner. - Go, go, go, go.

160
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,160
发生什么事了  里瑟先生
What's happening, Mr. Reese?

161
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,160
约翰  这里  救命
John, back here! Help!

162
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,500
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese?

163
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,940
笑一个  菜鸟
Smile, rookie!

164
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,170
放松点  约翰尼
Hey, relax, Johnny.

165
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,400
这可不是玩具
That's not a toy, you know.

166
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,900
能杀死人的
You could kill somebody with that thing.

167
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,680
好吧  你们骗到我了
All right, you got me.

168
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,620
假警报  芬奇  只是个恶作剧
False alarm, Finch. It was just a prank.

169
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
他们还真可爱
Well, that's endearing.

170
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,450
不幸的是  机器从来不会发出假警报
Unfortunately, the machine never issues a false alarm.

171
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,820
抢劫仍然会发生
The robbery will happen.

172
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,530
而一旦发生抢劫  这伙人的麻烦就大了
And when it does, this crew's in big trouble.

173
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,550
那个人怎么样了
How's our guy doing?

174
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,350
有些进展了  态度有点软化了
I'm making progress, softening him up a bit.

175
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,550
无所谓  你们有新任务了
Doesn't matter. You've been reassigned.

176
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,850
今晚出发  去中国
You head out tonight. China.

177
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,570
不行
No can do.

178
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,610
我得请几天假  家里有急事
I need to take leave--family emergency.

179
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,390
你没有家  里瑟
You don't have any family, Reese,

180
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,410
而且我很确定此情况  非常紧急
and I've been assured that the situation is...urgent.

181
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,100
那就去找其他人
So find someone else.

182
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,110
没时间找其他人了
There's no time to find someone else.

183
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,230
有件东西脱离我们掌控了
We've lost control of a certain item.

184
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,090
当务之急是确保这件东西的安全
Securing it is the highest priority.

185
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,400
-你们明白吗  -明白
- Do you understand? - We understand.

186
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,250
你丢了东西  需要我们找回来
You lost something. You need us to get it back.

187
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,800
我们要找什么
What are we looking for?

188
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,140
你知道"震网"吗
Are you familiar with Stuxnet?

189
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,870
一种电脑病毒
Computer virus.

190
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,080
是我们制造出来用于破坏伊朗核计划的
Built by us to disable the Iranian nuclear program.

191
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,830
你们要找的程序包与此相似
The package you're looking for is similar.

192
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,930
只不过其目标是中国
Only this one targets the Chinese.

193
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,790
对
That's correct.

194
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,480
我们确信国防部里有人把一台
We believe someone inside the Pentagon sold a secure laptop

195
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,980
含源代码的电脑卖给了一家中国公司
containing some of the source code to a Chinese firm.

196
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,130
他们可能研究这些代码用于自己的设备
They may be studying the code to inoculate their devices,

197
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,260
或者修改代码
or they may be modifying the code

198
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,800
来攻击美国的核设施
to target the U.S. nuclear infrastructure.

199
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,820
不管怎样  我们都得拿回电脑
Either way, we need the laptop returned.

200
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,100
-我们要去哪里  -鄂尔多斯
- Where are we going? - Ordos.

201
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,120
这是中国中部的一个企业开发区
It's a company town in the middle of China.

202
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,660
本来准备建成百万人口的地区
It was built for a million people,

203
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,600
可是投资的公司倒闭了
only the company that built it folded.

204
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
现在成了"鬼城"  没有居民
It's a ghost town. No residents.

205
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,040
所以你们坐飞机到北京
So you're gonna fly into Beijing.

206
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,810
以外交作掩护  两周时间收集情报
Diplomatic cover, two weeks to gather intel,

207
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,900
然后开始行动
then you're going in.

208
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,940
这台电脑非同小可  需极为谨慎
The laptop has to be handled with extreme caution,

209
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,320
所以不准使用电话  不许使用任何网络设备
so no phones. No network devices of any kind.

210
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,560
这个软件会侵入任何开放的通信线路
This software will exploit any open communication channel.

211
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,910
明白了吗
Understood?

212
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,940
走吧
Let's go.

213
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,350
里瑟
Reese.

214
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,620
还有件事
One more thing.

215
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,650
你拿到程序包之后
After you secure the package,

216
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,030
清除斯坦顿特工
You're to retire agent Stanton.

217
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,130
你让我杀了我的搭档吗
You're telling me to kill my partner?

218
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,160
我们拦截到了她和这个人的
We've intercepted unauthorized communications

219
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,780
未授权通信
between her and this man,

220
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,160
真主党的中间人
A go-between for Hezbollah.

221
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,580
有大笔资金汇入了一个海外账户
Large deposits into an off-shore account.

222
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,480
她叛变了
She's been compromised.

223
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,920
身为她的搭档  你应该意识到
As her partner, you should have noticed.

224
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,640
我们要自己清理门户  里瑟
We clean up our own mess, Reese.

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,820
你知道的
You know that.

226
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,130
完成这次任务  你想休假多久都行
You get this done, you can have all the leave you need.

227
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,780
明白吗
You understand?

228
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,570
我是洁西卡  你错过我喽
This is Jessica. You missed me.

229
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,840
请留言
Leave a message.

230
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,660
在找什么
What are we looking at?

231
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,770
我黑入了押运车公司的服务器
I've hacked the truck company's servers

232
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,440
找到了你今天的路线
and retrieved your route for today.

233
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,790
知道押运车的取货位置
If I know the pickup locations,

234
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,940
就能缩小可能发生抢劫的地域范围
I can narrow down where the robber might hit.

235
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,010
卡特给你
Carter get back to you

236
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,620
跟踪我们的车牌信息了吗
on the plate of the car following us?

237
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,750
还没
Not yet.

238
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,980
莱奈尔  好久没你消息了
Lionel, you've been quiet.

239
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,450
我都开始担心你了
I was getting worried.

240
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,780
是啊  跟着林奇置身于狂野西部了
Yeah, it's like the wild, wild west out here with Lynch.

241
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,300
因为我们抓到了以利亚  HR现在资金短缺
HR's getting short on funds since we took down Elias,

242
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,340
所以他要挥舞大棒收保护费呢
so he's chasing down street money with a baseball bat.

243
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,900
好像我道上的敌人还不够多似的
Not like I didn't have enough enemies on the street.

244
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,400
继续收集情报
Keep gathering intel.

245
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,640
我们得知道他们的头目是谁
We need to know their leadership.

246
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,220
拿下剩下的那些人
Take down the remaining players.

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,290
至少我费的这些劲赚到钱了
At least I'm getting a cut for my efforts.

248
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,610
你想要我怎么处理这些钱
What do you want me to do with the money?

249
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,710
我只关心HR  弗斯科  不关心钱
I care about HR, Fusco, not the money.

250
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,630
你自己看着办吧
What you do with it is your business.

251
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,380
-爸爸  -小子
- Hey, dad. - Hey, buddy.

252
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,570
不如等你训练结束后
What do you say I take you after practice,

253
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,800
我带你去买点新装备吧
get you some new gear?

254
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,960
-真的吗  -当然  有何不可
- Really? - Yeah, why not?

255
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,770
你发来的照片看起来很像是
These pictures you sent over look suspiciously like the ones

256
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,830
我们的自动车牌读取器拍下的
from our automated license plate readers.

257
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,500
你用了我的警车吗
Did you take one off my car?

258
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,440
没  没用你的
Well, no... not your car.

259
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,180
我就装作没听见好了
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

260
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,060
反正  车牌属于一辆95年的雪佛兰
Anyway, the plate belongs to a '95 gray Chevrolet van,

261
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,360
登记在一名72岁的交通管理员名下
registered to the 72-year-old transit authority administrator.

262
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,840
72岁的人追踪武装车吗
A 72-year-old that's casing an armored car?

263
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,880
所以我做了点调查
That's why I dug a little deeper.

264
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,900
原来车主的外甥  弗兰克・罗威尔
Apparently the owner's nephew, Frank Lowell,

265
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,670
在两个月前被释放
was paroled two months ago.

266
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,270
他05年因持械抢劫被捕
Busted back in '05 for armed robbery,

267
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,480
其同伙米克・诺顿也同时被捕  去年被释放
along with buddy, Mick Norton, released last year.

268
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,380

269
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,650
你对付这两个人可能需要帮助

270
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,450
我搞得定
I got it covered.

271
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,130
睡好你的美容觉了吗  美人
Hey, did you catch up on your beauty sleep, sunshine?

272
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,510
不算很好
Not so much.

273
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,890
做了个噩梦  梦到我和一群小丑一起工作
I had a nightmare I was working with a bunch of clowns.

274
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,020

275
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,460
他总是到处扮小丑
He's always clowning around.

276
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,350
那是汤米的妻子吗
Is that tommy's wife?

277
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,110
说到母老虎
Talk about a ball buster.

278
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,830
我把离婚周年纪念日
I celebrate the anniversary of my divorce

279
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,220
当新年一样庆祝
like it's new year's eve.

280
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,920
干这个工作已经压力够大了
This job is stressful enough.

281
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,180
没人想回家了还要听唠叨  免了
No one needs that nonsense to come home to, no.

282
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,160
婚姻就是折腾
Marriage is a racket.

283
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,750
还想再来吗  约翰
Back for more, John?

284
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,640
我看到莫里又翘了早上的普拉提课
I see Murray here skipped his morning Pilates again.

285
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,860
是啊  我开始新的法式土司养身法了
Yeah, I'm starting a new French toast regimen.

286
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,540
这位朋友是谁啊  汤米
Who's your friend, Tommy?

287
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,780
约翰新来的  艾希莉
John the newbie, Ashley.

288
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,290
他来熟悉下工作  我可是新人训练大师
He needs to learn the ropes, and I'm the ropes master.

289
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,730

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,560
能打包的东西
Something you can put in the bag.

291

我总是吃煎蛋三明治
I always stick with a fried egg sandwich.

292
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,800
是啊  可那是因为你不认识菜单上其他字
Yeah, but that's because you can't read the rest of the menu.

293
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,380
咖啡就好  谢谢

好了  美女们  该上班了
All right, ladies, time to punch in.

304
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,770
走吧
Let's go.

305
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,650
你以前干什么的  约翰
So what's your story, John?

306
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,820
在别的地方做过保安吗
You ever been a security guard anywhere else?

307
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,560
-偶尔  -商场保安吗
- Here and there. - Mall cop?

308
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,190
超市保安吗

309
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,860
差不多吧
Something like that.

310
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,250
我只是想说  这儿可不是沃尔玛
All I'm saying is, this ain't Walmart.

311
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,190
你之前被抢过吗
You ever been robbed before?

312
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,260
就一次
Once.

313
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,180
我和我搭档在转移一台自动取款机里的钱
My partner and I were servicing this ATM.

314
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,950
两个人带着枪出现
These two guys came up with guns.

315
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,500
我想当英雄来着  穿着防弹背心中了两枪
I tried to be a hero. Took two in the vest.

316
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,000
他们逃走了
They got away.

317
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,360
我断掉了几根肋骨  拿到了危险津贴
I got a set of cracked ribs and a bump in hazard pay.

318
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,310
别紧张  大多数任务都像现在这样
Don't worry. Most of the job is like this,

319
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,070
坐在运输车里
You know? Sitting around in traffic,

320
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,500
尽量不晕车就行了
trying not to get carsick.

321
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,090
如果子弹不来找你  无聊就来找你
If the bullets don't get you, the boredom will.

322
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,480
我已经把灰色货车的车牌做了标记
I've just flagged the gray van's license plate,

323
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,080
所以只要它一出现
so the plate reader will alert us

324
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,750
车牌读取器就会向我们示警
just as soon as it appears again.

325
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,900
我还调查了一下
I've also been able to retrieve some information

326
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,220

再下一站  里根医疗器材公司

333
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,010
主要产品是  心脏起搏器  还有其他的

334
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,390
这东西相当贵
Those are expensive,

335
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,840
很难随意在黑市上买卖
hardly something you can fence on the street.

336
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,060
-朝你过来了  莫里  -等一下

337

一盎司1千6百美金
$1,600 an ounce.

342
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,610
大概是一磅2万5千美金

343
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,080
那么50磅就是

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,670
里瑟先生  这些箱子价值125万美金
Mr. Reese, those cases are worth about $1.25 million.

345
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
这一定就是目标了
That must be the target.

346
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,750
哥们儿
Wow, bro.

347
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,050
放轻松
You need to relax.

快点  莫里  走吧
Come on, Murray, let's go.

349
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,350
我不明白
I don't understand.

350
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,620
劫案应该在那一站发生才对啊
The robbery should have taken place at the last stop.

351
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,150
你们剩下的地点只有  德维特杂货店了
All you've got left is Dewitt Grocery.

352
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,820
这相比之下很不合理
That's inconsequential compared--

353
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,770
待在这儿
Stay here.

354
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,250

我应该阻止他的

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,840
内部人作案一般都是

内应悄悄留门接应  然后拿到提成

409
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,490
用这种爆炸的手段

他最好有周全的逃离策略

他得把那些铂金脱手
He's still got to flip that platinum.

417

我在看我们装在

押运车内部的监控器传回的视频

他在抢劫前发了一条信息
Sent a text just before the robbery.

427
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,830
肯定是在向其他劫匪发信号

428
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,600
我们得找到他  芬奇

我得在汤米害更多人前阻止他

打了不少架  学会了怎么用拳头

我一整天都没和汤米联系过了

442

是啊  他可忙了

抢劫了自己的押运车  枪击了两个人
He robbed his own truck, shot two people,

444
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,380
你还没接到他的电话
and you still haven't heard from him.

445
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,370
汤米是个好人
Tommy is a good person.

446
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,430
他从没提过要从押运车偷东西
He's never talked about stealing anything off a truck.

447
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,520
真的吗
Is that right?

448
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,700

这是装钻石手链的
It's for a diamond tennis bracelet,

450
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,650
汤米两天前运送的货物中的一件

451
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,540
不过我猜这只是从押运车上掉下来的
But I guess it just fell off the truck.

452
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,140
什么钻石
A diamond what?

453
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,590
汤米没给过你手链  是吧
Tommy didn't give you a bracelet, did he?

454
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
汤米有外遇
Tommy's having an affair,

455
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,040
如果我们能找到小三  就能找到他
so if we find his girlfriend, we'll find him.

456
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,970
我进度比你超前  警探
I'm way ahead of you, detective.

457
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,100
-续杯吗  -当然
- Top off? - Absolutely.

458
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,590
有发现吗  芬奇
Anything yet, Finch?

459
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,150
是的  事实上
Yes, as a matter of fact.

460
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,190
同一个号码一小时内
One number in her call history

461
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,260
在她通讯记录里出现了好几次
comes up several times in the last hour.

462
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,560
没有来电显示
No name on the account.

463
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,490
也许是汤米用的一次性手机
Could be Tommy on a burner phone.

464
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,080
-你能追踪到他吗  -看我的
- Can you track him? - We'll see.

465
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,040
我从艾希莉的照片记录中发张艳照给他
I'm texting him an alluring photo from Ashley's archive,

466
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,040
希望能尽快有答复吧
Hoping it'll get a quick response.

467
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,650
当他打开信息
When he opens the message,

468
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,500
文件里的间谍程序木马
A spyware Trojan embedded in the file

469
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,060
会把他GPS的位置发给我
will send his GPS coordinates.

470
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,940
很好
Good.

471
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,520
里瑟先生  汤米的一次性手机有动静了
Mr. Reese, I got a hit on Tommy's burner phone.

472
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,250
他最近一次使用是在罗伊斯汽车旅馆
He last checked it from the Royce Motel.

473
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,710
汤米不在这里
Tommy's not here.

474
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,720
看来他的劫匪同伙们都死了
It looks like the robbers that were with him are dead.

475
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,800
他是在杀人灭口
He's cutting his ties to the heist,

476
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,020
独吞赃物
keeping the loot for himself.

477
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,560
尸体还有余温
Bodies are still warm.

478
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,040
汤米还没走
Tommy's still here.

479
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,840
别动
Hold it.

480
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,190
这可不是禽流感
So much for the bird flu.

481
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,770
这些人都被枪杀的
These people were gunned down.

482
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,650
他们是软件工程师  不是士兵
Software engineers, not soldiers.

483
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,450
为什么要杀他们
Why kill them?

484
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,240
还有一个活口  没死透
We got a live one here. Mostly alive.

485
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,900
求你给我一点东西

486
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,580
让我止痛

487
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,090
发生什么了

488
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,590
他们来

489
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,790
把它拿走了

490
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,230
拿走了什么

491
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,010
机器

492
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,290
机器

493
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,710
他说什么
What did he say?

494
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,610
说他想要止痛
He said he wanted something for the pain.

495
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,690
杀手行动利落
Action here was clean.

496
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,420
迅速
Fast.

497
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,850
可能是海陆侦察队或雇佣杀手干的
BMR recon team maybe or hired guns.

498
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,260
好像是程序包
Looks like the package.

499
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,500
为什么杀死所有人  偏偏却留下它
Why kill all these people and leave it behind?

500
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,980
或许他们把文件复制了
Maybe they copied it.

501
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,390
或者替换了  然后故意留给我们
Or altered it and left it for us to find.

502
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,970
天黑之前直升机都没法来接我们
Helo won't be able to pick us up till dark.

503
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,490
我们得到安全地带准备撤离
We need a safe place to wait for extract.

504
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,810
还要提防谁吗
Safe from whom?

505
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,730
我们现在可是这儿唯一的活人
We're the only living people in this city.

506
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,470
你先请
After you.

507
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,380
我刚刚应该开枪  以后的日子就轻松了
I should've shot you and simplified my life.

508
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,240
倍感压力了吗  莱奈尔
Pressure getting to you, Lionel?

509
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,100
-你来这儿干嘛  -林派我来的
- Why are you here? - Len sent me over.

510
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,740
要我跟一个叫克雷的家伙见面
Presupposed to meet a guy by the name of Clay.

511
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,360
HR也想参与抢劫案的分赃吗
HR looking for a cut of the heist?

512
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,750
整起抢劫案就是HR发起的
HR helped set up the heist.

513
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,090
他们亲自挑的人
They hand-picked the shooters.

514
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,630
我是来拿回属于HR的那份
I'm supposed to be picking up their cut.

515
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,770
那你有麻烦了  汤米・克雷早跑了
You've got a problem. Tommy Clay's long gone.

516
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,500
抛下了他的同伙
And he left his buddies behind.

517
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,960
我靠
Ah, jeez.

518
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,870
不把铂金拿回去
I don't come back with the platinum,

519
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,910
HR会觉得是我私吞了
HR's gonna think I took it.

520
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,360
那我就死定了
That makes me a dead man.

521
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,240
你得帮我
You gotta help me with this.

522
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,140
当初可是你让我跟那帮人打交道的
You got me working with these guys in the first place.

523
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,570
我会找到汤米
I'll find Tommy.

524
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,320
-你可以走了  -我走
- Now off you go. - Off I go?

525
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,970
我怎么跟HR交代啊
What am I gonna tell HR, huh?

526
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,530
你是个撒谎高手  警探  记得吗
You're a talented liar, detective, remember?

527
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,130
不然我当初干嘛选你
That's why I picked you.

528
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,780
-你在吗  芬奇  -永远都在
- You there, Finch? - Always.

529
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,210
如果你要问汤米在哪  我不知道
If you're calling to ask where Tommy is, I don't know.

530
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,010
他一离开汽车旅馆就把手机毁了
He destroyed his phone as soon as he left the motel.

531
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,650
除手机外还有别的信息吗
Get anything off the phone?

532
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,450
只有一条
Only that

533
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,800
他几乎什么都用"艾希莉"做密码
he uses the name Ashleyas a password on almost everything.

534
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,770
那个餐厅的艾希莉吗
Ashley from the diner?

535
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,070
-真是深情一片  -相互的
- Must be love. - And it's mutual.

536
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,510
我查了她信用卡的交易记录
I checked her credit card transactions.

537
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,680
她刚买了价值超过五千美元的
She just charged over $5,000 worth

538
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,860
路易威登行李箱
of Louis Vuitton suitcases.

539
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,740
她准备跟汤米一起逃跑
She's running off with Tommy.

540
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,660
我去找她  你去追查汤米的下落
I'll try to intercept her, and you try to track down Tommy.

541
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,550
我不确定这种人值得我们保护  里瑟先生
I'm not sure he deserves our protection, Mr. Reese.

542
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,220
他冷血地杀了自己的朋友
He killed his friend in cold blood

543
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,740
还给我背后来了一枪
and shot me in the back.

544
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,280
我想的可不是保护他
I wasn't thinking of protecting him.

545
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,610
你说这个家伙干掉了两个我们的人
You're telling me this guy killed two of our men

546
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,090
还带着铂金跑了
and took off with all the platinum?

547
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,710
大概是新手的运气吧
Maybe it's beginner's luck.

548
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,700
跃跃欲试啊  警探
Getting ambitious, detective?

549
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,510
想耍花招吗
Working an angle?

550
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,860
你要是不信我  自己去汽车旅馆看
Look, you don't believe me, go to the hotel.

551
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,900
那儿摆着两具死尸还有两个空箱子
There's two dead bodies and two empty cases.

552
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,610
要耍花招  弗斯科
Thing about angles, Fusco,

553
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,000
不管你怎么耍  结果都一样
You add 'em up, always comes out the same.

554
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,810
我们站在这儿扯得越久
You know, the longer we stand here talking,

555
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,070
那个汤米小子
the further distance this kid Tommy

556
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,960
拿着钱跑得就越远
is gonna put between us and our money.

557
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,050
就算你没摆我一道
Assuming you're not shining me on,

558
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,240
那小子可能藏铂金的地方就那些
there's only so many places he could fence the platinum.

559
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,710
都在哪儿  我们分头找
So where are they? We'll divvy them up.

560
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,600
不行  我们一起去
No. We do it together.

561
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,620
这样我才能盯住你
That way I can keep an eye on you.

562
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,350
-真是漫长的一天  -是啊
- Such a long day. - I know.

563
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,500
现在只想回家休息

-电话联系  -回头聊  拜
- Call me. - Talk to you later. Bye.

565
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,940
你好  艾希莉
Hello, Ashley.

566
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,800
-滚出去  -不
- Get out of my car. - No.

567
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,250
对不起
Sorry.

568
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,790
你是汤米的同事
You work with tommy.

569
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,640
你想干嘛
What do you want?

570
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,030
手镯真的不错
You know, that is a nice bracelet.

571
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,670
不是祖母给你的  对不对
Grandma didn't give it to you, did she?

572
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,320
我知道是谁给你的
But I know who did.

573
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,680
他在哪儿  汤米在哪儿  艾希莉
Where is he? Where's Tommy, Ashley?

574
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,430
我不知道
I don't know.

575
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,170
真的  我不知道
Honestly, I don't.

576
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,530
什么意思
What do you mean?

577
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,420
我本该在这里跟他见面
I'm supposed to wait for him here.

578
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,710
三个小时前他就该来接我的
He was gonna pick me up three hours ago,

579
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,320
所以要么他出了事  要么...
So either something terrible has happened to him or...

580
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,890
他抛下我走了
he's gone without me.

581
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,020
你们之前的计划是什么
What was your plan?

582
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,320
我就不该相信他
I never should have believed him.

583
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,150
他说他会带我逃离这一切
He said he was going to take me away from all this,

584
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,790
我们一起去墨西哥卡波海滩
and we were gonna go to Cabo together.

585
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,460
至少你得到了不错的路易威登包
Well, at least you got your nice Louis Vuitton bags.

586
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,050
原来汤米是真正的操纵者  芬奇
This Tommy's turned out to be a real operator, Finch.

587
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,310
这会儿  他把所有人都甩下了
And right now, he's putting everyone in his rearview mirror.

588
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,490
你有什么消息吗  
You got anything?

589
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,660
汤米是个习惯主义者
Tommy's a creature of habit.

590
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,830
所有密码都是一样的
Uses the same password for everything.

591
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,940
他的另一个习惯就是买塞米托一次性手机
His other habit is buying Symetel burner phones.

592
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,670
塞米托一直都在批量连贯销售号码
Symetel leases their numbers in consecutive blocks.

593
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,670
我写了一个脚本
I wrote a script

594
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,190
在所有新号码中搜索以"艾希莉"为密码的
trying the password "Ashley" on all new numbers,

595
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,740
找到了他的新号码
And I found his new phone.

596
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,200
以及他收到的一封网页语音邮件  你听

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,710
阿图罗拳击俱乐部  一小时后在那儿见
Arturo's Boxing Club. I'll be there in an hour.

599
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,530
我猜他就是汤米的铂金买家
My guess is this is the man Tommy's selling the platinum to.

600
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,690
这条消息四十五分钟前接收的
Message was received 45 minutes ago.

601
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,890
我就去  把地址发给卡特

602
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,610
我会把汤米绑起来  交给她
I'll wrap Tommy up, give him to her.

603
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,340
什么事
What's up?

604
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,080
那个押运车抢劫犯有下落了
Got a location on the armored truck robber--

605
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,160
在皇后区的阿图罗拳击俱乐部
Arturo's Boxing Club in Queens.

606
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,620
-约翰已经上路了  -卡特
- John's on his way there. - Carter.

607
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,460
警探  你听到了吗
Detective, did you hear me?

608
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,900
等等  中情局来找我了
Hang up. The CIA's onto me.

609
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,970
这回你们得靠自己解决了
You'll have to handle this on your own.

610
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,570
斯诺特工还有  这位不知叫什么名字的
Agent Snow and... whatever your name is.

611
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,530
-我叫伊万斯  -你们来干嘛
- Evans. - What do you want?

612
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,080
过来打个招呼  看看你怎么样
To say hi, see how you are.

613
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,080
我很好  你们来干嘛
I'm fine. What do you want?

614
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,700
我知道你在跟联调局谈里瑟的事
We know that you're talking to the FBI about Reese.

615
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,630
这犯法吗
Is there a law against that?

616
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,930
历史一次又一次地证明
As they've proven time and again,

617
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,520
联调局无法胜任涉及国家安全的事
the FBI cannot be trusted with matters of national security.

618
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,370
不要跟唐纳利特工谈
Do not talk to Agent Donnelly.

619
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,400
你指我们那位朋友的事吧
Oh, you mean about our mutual friend.

620
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,640
为什么  你怕唐纳利会先于你们找到他吗
Why, you're afraid Donnelly's gonna get to him first?

621
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,830
你到底怕他告诉唐纳利什么
What exactly are you worried he's gonna tell him?

622
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,750
小心点  警探
Be careful, detective.

623
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,260
我们就快抓到约翰了
We're closing the net on John.

624
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,590
他很会藏  但我很会找
He's good at hiding, but I'm good at finding people.

625
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,600
当我找到他
And when I do,

626
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,500
你就会后悔当初选错边站了
you're gonna want to be on the right side of this thing.

627
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,450
不要跟唐纳利谈
Don't talk to Donnelly.

628
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,890
里瑟先生  恐怕你得孤军奋战了
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid you're on your own now.

629
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,020
你中情局的老同事刚刚去找卡塔了
Carter just had a visit from your old colleagues in the CIA.

630
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,260
收到
Copy that.

631
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,920
谁在那儿
Who is it?

632
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,850
汤米
Hey, Tommy.

633
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,100
约翰尼
Johnny.

634
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,170
这下是回敬你在我背后开枪
That's for shooting me in the back.

635
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,170
这下是为了莫里
That's for Murray.

636
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,060
铂金在哪儿
Where's the platinum?

637
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,040
我不会说的
I'm not telling you.

638
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,970
你逃不掉的
You won't get away with this.

639
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,110
你不知道你对付的是什么人
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

640
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,140
你认为吗
You think?

641
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,730
我跟那些混球一样聪明
I'm just as smart as every one of those jerks.

642
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,000
汤米  你是清白人
Tommy, you were clean.

643
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,810
你有妻子  有孩子
You had a wife, a kid,

644
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,460
没有前科
no prior record.

645
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,770
但你都弃之不顾了  为什么
But you threw it all away. Why?

646
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,080
因为过去十年里的每一天
Because every day for the last ten years,

647
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,840
我都在保护别人的钱
I've protected other people's money,

648
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,080
但我却一无所有  一无所有
and I have nothing show for it. Nothing.

649
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,750
所以你觉得这世界欠你的  对吗
So the world owes you, is that it?

650
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,340
不  不欠我
No, it doesn't.

651
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,470
我想了很久才弄明白
I figured that one out. Took a while.

652
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,740
你知道我还弄明白了什么吗
You know what else I figured out?

653
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,680
运着那些钱
Hauling around all that money--

654
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,550
伸手一拿就是你的
You get what you take.

655
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,190
-所以我拿了我的  -这是不可能的
- So I'm taking mine. - That's not gonna happen.

656
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,900
你的这一自我想法  汤米
The thing about striking out on your own, Tommy,

657
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,320
只会让你自我毁灭
is that's usually how you end up.

658
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,710
是吗
Yeah?

659
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,040
我感觉你所言有理
I think you got that just about right.

660
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,150
嗨  汤米
Hi, Tommy.

661
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,490
嗨  宝贝
Hi, babes.

662
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,310
帮我摆平这位忧郁王子  好吗
Help me get rid of this mope, will you?

663
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,950
花了数十年研发完美的营养口粮
Spent decades trying to invent the perfect nutritional ration.

664
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,920
还是难以下咽
And it's still inedible.

665
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,830
这些被淘汰只是时间问题
It's just a matter of time before this is all obsolete.

666
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,940
我们还是得吃
We'll still have to eat.

667
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,570
我不是说吃的
I'm not talking about the mres.

668
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,590
卫星代替了监控小组
You got satellites replacing surveillance teams,

669
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,370
无人飞机代替了战斗机飞行员
drones replacing fighter pilots.

670
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,420
所以我们都过时无用了吗
So we've outlived our usefulness?

671
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,170
我们会被一个按钮换掉  对吗
We'll be replaced by a push of a button, is that it?

672
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,630
你认为呢
What do you think?

673
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,190
我认为我们还在这儿
I think we're still here.

674
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,190
你想过我们是怎样得到情报的吗
You ever wonder where we get our intel?

675
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,360
我以为你从不问问题
I thought you didn't ask questions,

676
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,710
只服从命令
just followed orders.

677
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,390
我可没说过这容易做到
I never said it was easy.

678
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,450
天要黑了
Sun's setting.

679
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,930
该走了
Time to go.

680
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,200
喂
Yeah?

681
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,850
我们的朋友遇上麻烦了
Our friend is in a bit of trouble.

682
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,120
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

683
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,810
谁的电话
Who are you talking to?

684
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,090
我现在很忙  没法讲电话
I'm busy right now. I can't talk.

685
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,040
我前妻
My ex.

686
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,080
现在告诉我  是谁在追我们
Now you're going to tell me who's coming for us.

687
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,790
铂金在哪儿  汤米
Where's the platinum, Tommy?

688
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,450
拳击台下面
It's over there under the ring

689
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,220
在装手套的箱子里
in that box with the gloves.

690
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,680
原来是艾希莉出主意  你动手
So Ashley's the brains, and you're the muscle.

691
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,270
是吗  汤米
Is that right, Tommy?

692
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,960
我们是搭档
We're partners.

693
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,140
是她说服你动手的  是吗
She convinced you it was time to make your move, didn't she?

694
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,280
她说你理应得到更多
She said you deserve more from life.

695
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,120
别理他  汤米
Ignore him, Tommy.

696
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,720
-我很抱歉  -抱歉
- I'm so sorry. - Sorry?

697
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,680
你为什么抱歉
What are you sorry for?

698
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,870
大鱼吃小鱼的规则
The law of the fishes.

699
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,620
我早该知道的
I should've seen it coming.

700
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,180
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

701
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,290
我所帮助的人  我从不知道
The people I help, I never know

702
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,870
他们是被害人还是行凶者
if they're gonna be the victim or the perp,

703
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,930
但我觉得  这回  你两者都是
but I think, this time, you're both.

704
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,650
现在如何
Now what?

705
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,980
你认为你能走出这里
You think you're going to walk out of here

706
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,100
从此过上幸福的生活吗
and live happily ever after?

707
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,830
你面对的是一群十恶不赦的坏人
You're dealing with some very bad people.

708
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,810
闭嘴
Shut up.

709
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,410
现在  你手上有他们要的
Right now, you have what they want,

710
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,420
他们不拿到东西绝对不会罢休
And they won't stop until they get it.

711
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,060
你第一次开枪杀人吗
First time you shot someone?

712
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,680
第一次总是很难
First one's hard.

713
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,850
你可能已经考虑过一阵子
You've probably been thinking about it for a while,

714
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,380
做好了思想准备
psyched yourself up.

715
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,270
但第二枪会更艰难
But the second one can even be harder.

716
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,040
都在那儿吗
All there?

717
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,590
-是的  -知道不
- Yeah. - What do you know?

718
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,530
原来你没撒谎
You weren't lying after all.

719
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,410
瞧瞧这是谁啊
Well, look who's here...

720
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
卡特的守护天使
Carter's guardian angel.

721
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,680
就知道我们早晚有再见的时候
Thought our paths might cross again at some point.

722
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,960
我看这次轮到你被挂在楼外边了
I think it's your turn to hang off the side of a building.

723
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,230
别管他了  我们赶快走吧
Hey, forget him, let's get out of here.

724
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,450
说得对
You're right.

725
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,660
我是想再玩玩的
I was gonna have some fun.

726
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,740
不过还是一枪解决吧
But I'll just shoot him.

727
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,870
里瑟先生  你还好吧
Mr. Reese, everything okay?

728
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,530
芬奇  我们要用到你的后车箱了
Finch, we're going to need your trunk.

729
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,390
不用  我能摆平
No, I got this one.

730
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,770
我是用她的枪打的
I shot him with her gun.

731
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,210
能轻易布置成
Simple enough to make it look

732
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,130
好像林奇把整件事搞砸的
like Lynch botched the whole thing.

733
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,570
你越来越擅长了  莱奈尔
You're getting good at this, Lionel.

734
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,240
我一直很擅长
I was always good at this.

735
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,560
不然你当初干嘛选我
That's why you picked me in the first place.

736
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,640
记得吗
Remember?

737
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,410
该结束了  约翰
Time to wrap this up, John.

738
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,450
听着  卡拉  有件事要告诉你
Listen, Cara, there's something you need to know--

739
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,150
对不起  约翰
Sorry, john.

740
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,490
我也不想
Nothing personal.

741
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,320
他们告诉我你已经叛变了
They told me you've been compromised,

742
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,310
身为你的搭档  我得清理门户
that as your partner, it was my mess to clean up.

743
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,800
有什么好笑的
Something funny?

744
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,290
我接到了相同的命令
I got the same orders as you.

745
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,270
派我们来的人并不是想让我们取回程序包
Whoever sent us here doesn't want us to retrieve the package.

746
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,680
而只是想确认它被毁掉了
They want to confirm it's destroyed.

747
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,280
他们希望任何与之有接触的人都被毁掉
They want everyone who had contact with it destroyed.

748
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,960
而你刚刚给了他们信号
And you just gave them a beacon.

749
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,470
-目标锁定  -可以发射了
- Target locked. - You are clear to engage.

750
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,820
发射
Engaging.

751
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,590
这次我们做成了什么事吗
Did we actually accomplish anything here?

752
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,960
我们阻止了汤米杀人后逍遥法外
We stopped Tommy from getting away with murder.

753
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,780
也算做成点事
That's something.

754
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,330
他本来就没机会逃生  不是吗
He didn't stand a chance, did he?

755
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,450
想当坏人的麻烦就在于
Problem with trying to be the bad guy...

756
