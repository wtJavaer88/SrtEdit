1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,310
你正被监视着
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,370
政府有一套秘密系统
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,050
一台每时每刻都在监视你的机器
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,950
我会知道  因为它是我造的
I know because I built it.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,540
我设计这台机器是为了侦测恐怖活动
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,250
但它却看到了一切
but it sees everything...

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,100
它看到了与普通人相关的暴力罪行
Violent crimes involving ordinary people,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,380
像你一样的普通人
people like you,

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,290
而政府认为这些罪行无关紧要
crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,120
他们不肯作为  所以我决定插手
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,330
但我需要一个搭档
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,820
一个有能力介入其中的人
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,400
因为受到当局追捕  我们只能秘密合作
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,260
你永远找不到我们
You will never find us.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,440
不管你是被害人还是行凶者
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,260
如果你的号码被列出来  我们就会找到你
if your number's up, we'll find you.

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,730
<font color="#00FF00">《疑犯追踪》 第1季 第19集</font>
<font color="#00FF00">Person of Interest S01E19 720p HDTV x264</font>
<font color="#00FF00">-= 人人字幕 =-</font>

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,860
有时候我会想  如果她没有被杀
Sometimes I wonder what kind of man I'd be

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,630
我会变成怎样的人呢
if she hadn't been killed.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,140
我听说失去父母后  人会改变
I hear people change when they lose a parent,

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,040
特别是如果其父母死于谋杀
especially when that parent is murdered.

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,540
今天有个大考  对吧
Big test today, right?

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,000
我以前恨死代数了
I always hated algebra.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,950
那些什么x啊y啊搞得我稀里糊涂
All those xs a ys made my head spin.

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,520
我对那个倒无所谓
I don't mind it so much.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,740
你想跟我谈谈吗
Hey, you wanna talk about it?

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,780
-没什么大事  -看起来可不像
- It's no big deal. - It seems like it might be.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,460
只是某些阔佬傻逼为我拿奖学金的事
It's just some rich d-bag's giving me a hard time

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,880
-给我难堪了  -告诉我是谁
- for being on scholarship. - I wanna know who they are.

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,850
-不要  -泰勒
- No way. - Taylor.

31
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,070
我最不喜欢你掺和这种事情
Last thing I need is you fighting my battles.

32
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,660
我不是小孩子了
I'm not some little kid.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,590
今晚我坐地铁回家
I'll take the subway home tonight.

34
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,450
我知道你要工作到很晚
I know you're working late.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,230
-晚上吃泰式炒面  -好
- Pad Thai for dinner? - Yeah.

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,490
祝你今天愉快
Have a good day, okay?

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,690
卡特
Carter.

38
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,660
我是科调司的拉布兰卡
It's Lablanca in S.I.D.

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,270
准备迎接我给予的快乐时光吧
You ready for me to make your day?

40
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,870
你是要说我赢得去夏威夷的带薪假了吧
You're about to tell me I won a paid vacation to Hawaii?

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,360
差不多了
Almost as good.

42
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,830
还记得那些你认为属于以利亚的账户吧
You know those accounts you thought belonged to Elias?

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,760
几星期前我们追踪到的投资银行吗
The ones we traced to that investment firm a few weeks ago?

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,430
你发现那些账户的时候
When you flagged those accounts,

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,330
里边有4百万美元的余额
they had a balance of $4 million.

46
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,910
而到了今天早上  一分钱不剩了
As of this morning, not a dime.

47
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,430
以利亚把账户提空了  卡特  全提空了
Elias drained them, Carter. All of them.

48
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,090
我十分钟内赶到
I'll be there in ten minutes.

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,820
来得可有点晚啊  里瑟先生
Bit of a late start, Mr. Reese.

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,510
你忘了上闹钟了吗
Did you forget to set your alarm?

51
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,870
上瑜伽课去了
Had my yoga class.

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,080
好吧  希望你保持真气充盈
Well, I hope you've gotten in touch with your Chi

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,510
因为今天可有得受了
because it seems we have a big day ahead of us.

54
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,360
今早收到了五个号码
We received five numbers this morning.

55
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,240
大丰收啊
Bumper crop.

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,390
来见识下五大家族的首领
Meet the heads of the five families.

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,920
卡帕雷利
Caparelli.

58
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,940
桑布拉诺  格里福尼
Zambrano. Grifoni.

59
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,990
巴西莱
Basile.

60
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,580
吉亚尼・莫雷蒂二世
Gianni Moretti Jr.

61
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,940
莫雷蒂的儿子
Moretti's son.

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,210
莫雷蒂进监狱后他儿子开始管事
Junior took over when Moretti went to prison.

63
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,950
除非是这些人突然决定
Unless all these men suddenly decided

64
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,940
要开始内讧
to turn on one another,

65
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,960
我认为比较合理的假设是  他们被人盯上了
I think it's fair to assume that they're being targeted.

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,880
疯狂到敢对全体黑手党头目下手的人
Short list of people crazy enough to take on

67
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,530
数量不会很多
the entire leadership of the Cosa Nostra.

68
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,520
就我看来  只有一个
Only one, in my opinion.

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,510
以利亚
Elias.

70
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,660
他已经绑架了自己的父亲
He's already kidnapped his father.

71
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,130
除掉剩下的几个头目
Eliminate the remaining dons,

72
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,010
他就能掌管整个黑帮了
he could control the entire mafia.

73
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,450
我不确定  芬奇
I don't know, Finch.

74
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,880
我们可以让他们黑吃黑
We could let the trash take out the trash.

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,920
我知道你在中情局工作时  他们会鼓励纵容
I know they encouraged a certain moral flexibility

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,050
你"从权"的道德观  里瑟先生
when you worked at the CIA, Mr. Reese,

77
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,890
但我以为  我们要有更高的道德标准
but I like to think that we're reaching for a higher standard

78
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,110
无论如何
In any case,

79
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,730
我们都要考虑到间接伤害
we need to consider the collateral damage.

80
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,830
那我们就得给这五位纽约市最有权势的罪犯
So we're going to babysit the five most powerful criminals

81
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,730
当回保姆了
in New York.

82
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,310
怎么接近他们呢
How do we get close to them?

83
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,560
这些先生们每个月会在
These gentlemen meet once a month

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,520
布鲁克林的盟约俱乐部聚会一次
at the covenant club in Brooklyn.

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,860
私人会议室里面没有摄像头
There are no cameras allowed inside the private meeting room

86
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,890
也不许带手机
and no cell phones.

87
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,280
想要监视这些家伙可不容易
Not gonna be easy to spy on these guys.

88
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,680
对你来说也一样  芬奇
Not even for you, Finch.

89
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,590
好像在对我下战书啊  里瑟先生
That sounds like a challenge, Mr. Reese.

90
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,080
俱乐部最近重新安装了一套消防警报系统
The club recently installed a new fire alarm system.

91
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,580
紧急情况下  消防员能够
In case of emergency, fire fighters could communicate

92
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,790
与被困其中的人通过声音系统交流
with anyone trapped inside through a sound system.

93
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,280
但是通过转换电极  任何话筒
But any speaker can be converted to a crude microphone

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,390
都能变成简单的麦克风
by reversing polarity.

95
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,640
那些国土安全部的白痴们
Those idiots from the Department of Homeland Security,

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,620
连贿赂都不会收
they can't even take a bribe right.

97
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,710
出货只有原定的二分之一
That shipment was half of what it was supposed to be.

98
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,130
现在怎么办
What are we gonna do with it?

99
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,660
干得漂亮  芬奇
Nice work, Finch.

100
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,030
咱们得加快速度
We'll step on it more than usual.

101
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,030
如果顾客要投诉
If the customers complain,

102
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,390
可以投进意见箱里
they can put a note in our suggestion box.

103
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,950
你们开什么玩笑
You kidding me with this?

104
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,160
生意照常  就当什么也没发生吗
Business as usual like nothing's changed?

105
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,110
我们对你父亲的际遇感到抱歉  二世
We're all very sorry for your father's situation, Junior.

106
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,350
际遇
Situation?

107
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,180
我父亲可能都已经死了
My father's probably dead.

108
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,060
我想知道家族准备如何
I wanna know what the family's gonna do to retaliate

109
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,860
报复以利亚
against this Elias.

110
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,530
你是说你同父异母的哥哥
You mean your half-brother?

111
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,150
你老子自找的
Your old man brought this on himself.

112
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,850
他射出了那混球  然后又架不住丢人
He sired a little bastard and then he had the poor taste

113
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,120
干掉那当妈的
to have the mother bumped off.

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,760
这是无耻的谎言
That's a filthy lie.

115
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,060
无意冒犯  二世
No disrespect, Junior.

116
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,000
我们不在乎你要不要请以利亚来欢度感恩节
We don't care if you bring Elias over for Thanksgiving.

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,740
他是个明白人  能给我们带来钱
He's a player, brings in a lot of cash.

118
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,780
你们居然想跟他合作  你们明知道他抢劫你
You wanna work with a man that you know is robbing you?

119
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,910
还吞食了我们的地盘
And stealing our territories?

120
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,550
这是生意  又不是谈情说爱
It's a business, kid. It's not a love affair.

121
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,930
跟他合作
We work with him,

122
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,690
我们都能赚大钱
we all get rich.

123
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,240
我们得告诉这些先生们
We need to convey to these gentlemen

124
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,860
以利亚没兴趣跟他们做交易
that Elias won't be interested in making a deal.

125
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,460
我以为该通知卡特警探了
I think it's time to update Detective Carter.

126
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,360
有难度  她现在都不跟我们说话了
That could be difficult, since she's not speaking to us.

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,170
一声道歉  大有裨益  里瑟先生
An apology might go a long way, Mr. Reese.

128
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,780
如果以利亚把钱都转移走了
If Elias moved all of his money,

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,080
那转到哪儿去了呢
where did it go?

130
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,770
我暂时也没头绪
I don't know yet.

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
款项流向了1000个不同的客户
The funds went out to over 1,000 unique payees.

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,430
拿到其中某一位的姓名了吗
Did you get any names of the people he paid?

133
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,850
没那么容易
It's not that easy.

134
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,440
是啊  对付这家伙就没容易过
Yeah, it never is with this guy.

135
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,320
除了现金就是银行电汇
Everything's going out as cash or wire transfers.

136
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,240
我们能追踪到
We could trace it,

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,450
但是光申请到搜查证就要几周的时间
but the warrants alone would take a couple weeks.

138
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,920
你认为他都买了些什么
What do you think he's buying?

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,210
以利亚才不在乎物质
Elias doesn't care about material things.

140
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,250
他收买的是人
He buys people.

141
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,080
甘愿为钱杀人的人
People who'll murder for money.

142
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,840
睁只眼闭只眼的警察和政客们
Cops and politicians who'll look the other way.

143
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,250
不管他买的是什么  数量巨大
Well, whatever it is, he just bought a lot of it.

144
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,370
你得用手抓着吃了
You'll have to eat with your hands.

145
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,920
我还记得你以前可是使刀高手
I remember you were pretty good with a knife back in the day.

146
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,460
他们叫你"刀锋战士"  对吧
They called you "The Blade", right?

147
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,780
我永远都理解不了你们那一代人  还有
I never understood your generation and...

148
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,760
你们那些搞笑的绰号
the ridiculous nicknames.

149
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,180
你们虚度光阴  慢慢变得脑满肠肥
You spent too much time growing fat.

150
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,630
软弱无力
Soft.

151
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,310
其中一些甚至想把家族生意合法化
Some of them even tried to turn the family legit,

152
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,490
比如你儿子
like your son.

153
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,300
我是说  你真正的儿子
I mean, your real son.

154
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,690
你为什么不直接杀了我
Why don't you just kill me already?

155
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,780
我可不想你错过好戏
I would hate for you to miss the show.

156
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,090
我要完成你一直没种动手的事情
I'm gonna do what you never had the stones to.

157
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,880
我会联合这些家族  控制一切
I'm gonna unite the families, and take control.

158
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,850
无名小卒的痴心妄想
That's some plan for a nobody.

159
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,280
你真认为我的同伙们会跟着你
And you think my associates are gonna go along

160
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,820
折腾这场闹剧吗
with this farce?

161
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,570
他们没有选择
They won't have a choice.

162
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,730
还有  我从来就不懂分享
Besides, I never learned how to share.

163
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,930
我母亲应该教教我
My mother might have taught me,

164
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,880
不过她没有机会  不是吗
but she didn't get the chance, did she?

165
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,380
45分钟赶到皇后区  我可是有正经活儿的
45 minutes to Queens? I got a real job, you know.

166
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,490
HR才是你的正经活儿  弗斯科
HR is your real job, Fusco.

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,420
我需要点情报
I need some intel on that guy

168
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,490
有个人老是在城里搅事
who's been stirring things up around town.

169
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,170
一个高个子西装男
Tall guy with a suit.

170
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,900
老喜欢打穿别人的膝盖
Likes shooting people in the kneecaps.

171
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,530
这不是旧闻了吗
I thought he was yesterday's news.

172
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,450
联帮探员可不这样想
Not to the feds.

173
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,960
他们新建了一个专案组负责找他
They set up a new task force trying to locate him.

174
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,660
我们需要所有组内动向
We wanna know everything they do,

175
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,640
想自己先找到他
see if we can get to him ourselves.

176
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,510
怎么  你们要拉拢他吗
Why, you looking to put him on the payroll?

177
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,970
你问题太多了  弗斯科
You ask a lot of questions, Fusco.

178
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,630
哥有一颗刨根问底的心啊
I got an inquisitive mind.

179
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,380
我们现在给以利亚干活
We're doing a job for Elias.

180
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,460
什么时候HR给以利亚干活了
Since when does HR work for Elias?

181
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,960
我们不为任何人干活
We don't work for anybody.

182
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,050
我们有奶就是娘
We lend a hand when it's in our best interest.

183
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,960
现在以利亚有奶
Right now that's Elias.

184
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,950
等你完成任务
When you're done looking into that matter,

185
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,400
最好请病假
I'd call in sick.

186
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,950
接下来这几天  你可不会想在凶案组上班
You don't wanna be working Homicide next couple of days.

187
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,470
你确定这是最佳行动方案吗
Are you certain this is the best course of action?

188
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,510
黑手党们对于不请自来的人
Mafiosi don't take kindly to people who approach them...

189
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,660
不甚友善
unannounced.

190
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,190
会表现得像狗急跳墙
They're like feral dogs that way.

191
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,210
没时间磨叽  只能单刀直入  芬奇
No time for anything but the direct approach, Finch.

192
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,730
还有  我对付狗相当有一套
Besides, I've always been good with dogs.

193
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,100
怎么  迷路了吗
What are you, lost?

194
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,280
我来提醒你们一下以利亚的事儿
I'm here to give you a heads up about Elias.

195
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,950
他自有算盘
He's got plans.

196
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,260
可没预你们几位的位置
And they don't include you and your friends.

197
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,650
-你是警察吗  -边都挨不上
- You a cop? - Not even close.

198
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,660
坦白说  我可不介意
Frankly, I'd be inclined

199
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,640
你们这群蠢货自相残杀
to let you idiots kill each other,

200
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,730
不过那样会惹出麻烦
But that could get messy.

201
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,940
你的人没法保护你
Your men here can't protect you.

202
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,060
但是我可以  只要你们跟我来
But I can. If you come with me.

203
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,480
多谢关心  朋友  不过
Thanks for your concern, my friend, but...

204
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,310
我不需要你的帮助
I don't need your help.

205
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,210
我被三振了  芬奇  卡帕雷利不听我的
I struck out, Finch. Caparelli wouldn't listen to me.

206
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,460
发生什么事了  里瑟先生
What happened, Mr. Reese?

207
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,030
以利亚找上他了  芬奇
Elias got to him, Finch.

208
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,400
间接伤害这点你算是说对了
You were right about collateral damage.

209
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,680
我希望他们死  全都死光
I wish they were dead. All of them.

210
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,320
-发生了什么  卡尔  -他们先挑头的
- What happened, Carl? - They started it.

211
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,000
骂我
Calling me names.

212
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,720
比彻女士说你的期末报告一直没交
Ms. Beecher told me you never turned in your term project.

213
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,670
因为那期末报告太蠢了
That's 'cause it was stupid.

214
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,480
是这个吗
Is this it?

215
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,950
我不是私生子
I'm not a bastard.

216
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,240
你是为这个和他们打架的吗
Is that why you fought them?

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
谁那么叫你
Who called you that?

218
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,890
来  我帮你填完剩下的
Come on, I'll help you fill out the rest.

219
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,720
填些什么  这是家谱
With what? It's for family.

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,510
卡尔・以利亚  你有我
Well, Carl Elias, you got me.

221
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,210
还有你的养姐妹
And your foster sisters.

222
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,490
我有妈妈
I had a mother.

223
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,220
她去世了
She's gone.

224
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
或许我们可以调查一下
Maybe we could do some research,

225
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,340
找到更多名字填上去
find some more names to fill in.

226
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,050
比如我爸爸吗
Like my father?

227
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,540
亲爱的
H-honey...

228
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,860
你肯定知道些什么  他是谁
You must have heard something about him, who he was--

229
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,660
卡尔  拜托
Carl, do me a favor.

230
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,850
别纠结了
Let it go.

231
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,630
你觉得他知道
Do you think he even knows

232
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,320
妈妈身上发生的事吗
about what happened to my mom?

233
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,670
据我所知  宝贝
Here's what I know, baby.

234
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,000
我们每个人都是国王的后裔
We are all descended from kings.

235
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,320
你必须走自己的路
You gotta live your own life.

236
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,910
做自己的王
Be your own man.

237
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,180
明白了吗
You understand?

238
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,690
我正想你什么时候会打来呢  约翰
I was wondering when you'd call, John.

239
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,430
听说你下午目睹了一场惨剧
I heard you witnessed the tragedy earlier this afternoon.

240
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,660
希望你没在爆炸中受伤
I hope you weren't hurt from the explosion.

241
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,790
以利亚
Elias...

242
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,270
停手吧  别再伤害更多人了
End this before anyone else gets hurt.

243
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,820
我只是做了我认为最有利于这个城市的事
I'm only doing what I think is best for the city.

244
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,650
所以你要干掉每个挡你路的人吗
So you're gonna kill everyone who gets in the way?

245
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,810
虽然你不愿承认  但我们是同一类人
We're more alike than you'd like to admit.

246
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,950
都不惜杀人
Both killers in our own right.

247
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,180
不过现在你要救的是查理・伯顿那样的无辜者
But now you save innocent people like Charlie Burton,

248
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,480
而不是那些老黑帮
Not old gangsters.

249
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,140
就把他们留给我好了
Just leave those men to me.

250
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,100
你知道我不会那么做
You know I can't do that.

251
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,570
不出所料
I can't say I'm surprised.

252
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,460
回见吧
See you on the other side.

253
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,070
还有个麻烦  卡特警探
We have another problem. Detective Carter.

254
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,740
我还以为她没接电话
I thought she wasn't answering her calls.

255
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,590
是没接
She wasn't.

256
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,480
不过你知道的  我总能
But as you know, I've always taken

257
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,360
善用手机的各种功能
a somewhat liberal view of how to use a telephone.

258
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,560
她知道以利亚在计划些什么
She knows that Elias is up to something.

259
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,990
卡帕雷利被杀后  她开始联系
After Caparelli's murder, she started reaching out

260
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,650
其余的黑帮头目  要为他们提供警方保护
to the remaining dons, offering them police protection.

261
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,810
她不知道以利亚
She doesn't know that Elias

262
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,150
是要马上把他们全干掉
is planning to take them all out at once.

263
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,470
也不知道以利亚有HR的协助
Or that he's got HR's backing.

264
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,150
把她的位置给我  快
I need her location. Now.

265
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,070
你们跟我来
You come with me.

266
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,450
剩下的人封锁这个街区
The rest of you lock down both ends of the block

267
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,850
直到我们把这个人带走  明白了吗
until we get this guy out of here, understood?

268
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,670
我们要接谁啊  警探
Who are we bringing in, detective?

269
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,900
黑帮头目巴西莱
Don Basile.

270
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,310
我们抓到以利亚之前
He's going into protective custody

271
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,600
对他进行保护性监禁
until we can take down Elias.

272
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,830
-你是卡特吗  -是
- You carter? - Yeah.

273
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,200
我怎么知道不是以利亚雇你来的
How am I supposed to know you're not on Elias's payroll?

274
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,000
你是不知道
You can't.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,690
你要是有别的选择  那就别听我的
You got another option, I recommend you take it.

276
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,650
否则  就跟我走吧
Otherwise, let's move.

277
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,920
好吧  走  走
All right, come on, come on.

278
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,570
警探
Detective...

279
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,660
人都去哪儿了
Where'd everyone go?

280
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,710
退后
Get back.

281
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,060
快退后
Get back!

282
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,130
你真应该接电话的  警探
You really should return your calls, detective.

283
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,350
这些是新的盗版光碟  老大
Those new bootleg CDs, boss.

284
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,620
卢的车箱里还有更多
We got a whole bunch more in Lou's trunk.

285
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,580
等等  孩子
Hold on a second, kid.

286
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,390
我要跟他聊几句
I'd like a word, please.

287
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,080
也许我该留下  爸爸
Maybe I should stay, pop.

288
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,370
回家去  告诉你妈妈我已经吃过了
Go home, tell your mother I already ate.

289
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,900
可是  爸爸  我觉得...
But, pop, I was just thinking--

290
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,720
你是卢介绍来的  对吗
You came to us through Lou, right?

291
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,970
是的  先生
That's right, sir.

292
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,300
问题是  我并不太了解你  孩子
Thing is, I don't know much about you, kid,

293
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,920
不过你看起来很眼熟
But you look familiar.

294
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,230
再联系下名字  以利亚
Along with the name. Elias.

295
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,530
我想你明白我的意思
I think you know what I mean.

296
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,330
我的妈妈是玛琳・以利亚  先生
My mother was Marlene Elias, sir.

297
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,790
我想也是
I thought so.

298
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,130
美丽的女人
Beautiful woman.

299
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,200
据说是的  先生
I've been told that, sir.

300
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,630
我曾经想过这一天来临的时候
I thought about when this day might come.

301
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,930
我会对你说些什么
What I would say to you.

302
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,440
你来这儿做什么  孩子  你想要我做什么
What are you doing here, kid? What do you want from me?

303
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,090
我只想要一份工作  先生
I just want a job, sir.

304
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,990
一个向高手学习的机会
A chance to learn from the best.

305
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,730
来证明自己
To prove myself.

306
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,290
你知道钻石是怎么形成的吗  孩子
You know where diamonds come from, kid?

307
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,330
开始只是块碳
Starts out as carbon.

308
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,760
黑如煤  深埋在地球深处
Black as coal, buried miles beneath the earth.

309
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,770
承受重压  炙烤于比地狱更热的温度
Takes pressure, temperatures hotter than hell.

310
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,710
数以亿年  直到火山喷发
Billions of years, until a volcano

311
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,420
将其喷至地球表面
blows it to the surface.

312
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,200
这是成就一颗钻石的唯一途径
That is the only way to form a diamond.

313
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,790
从来没听说过
Never heard that before.

314
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,050
我也从不知道我父亲是谁
I didn't know my father either.

315
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,380
我活下来了
I survived.

316
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,470
我不知道这些  先生
I didn't know that, sir.

317
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,270
但是...
But...

318
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,630
你会来此是因为你明白了某些事情
You're here because you figured some things out.

319
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,980
所以你我之间
So now you and me,

320
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,050
有了自己的小秘密
we have our own little secret.

321
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,170
他们告诉我你很有两下子  孩子
They tell me you got a pair, kid.

322
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,740
坚忍不拔  精明能干
Tenacious. Capable.

323
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,590
-不胜荣幸  先生  -抬起头来
- I like to think so, sir. - You keep your head up.

324
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,340
这儿有你的一席之地
There's a place for you here.

325
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,530
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

326
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,730
很高兴终于跟你见面了
So nice to finally meet you.

327
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,440
那个警官情况已经稳定了
The officer's stable.

328
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,970
我们很幸运  你出现的正是时候
Lucky for us, you got good timing.

329
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,300
我想你已经知道了
I guess you should know,

330
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,310
联邦调查局特地为你成立了个特别小组
the FBI has a new task force set up in your honor.

331
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,360
他们认为你在为以利亚做事
They think you're working with Elias.

332
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,410
我经常被误解
I'm often misunderstood.

333
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,540
看来巴斯勒先生的事情未如所期
I take it things didn't go as expected with Mr. Basile.

334
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,720
我都不知道该相信谁了
I don't know who to trust anymore.

335
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
你可以相信我们...
You can trust us...

336
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,330
警探
Detective.

337
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,660
以利亚在过去48小时里把4百万美金
Elias transferred $4 million in the past 48 hours

338
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,550
转到了全市的数十处提现点
to a dozen cash and carry hubs around the city.

339
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,440
我们可以用这些转账记录追踪到
We could use those transfers to track down

340
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,140
为他做事的人  但...
the men working for him, but...

341
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,380
没有搜查证我没法进入他们的数据库
I can't access their database without a warrant.

342
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,390
也许我可以动用  另一种技术
Maybe I could use...other techniques...

343
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,170
查到我们所需要的信息
to access the information we need.

344
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,740
如果我们从以利亚的付款单顺藤摸瓜
If we track down the men on Elias's payroll,

345
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,640
也许能直接查到他本人
they may lead us right to him.

346
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,040
与此同时
In the meantime,

347
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,630
我还得说服那帮黑帮老大们
I need to convince those old dons

348
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,780
如果想活命的话就得跟我们合作
that the only way to stay alive is to work with us.

349
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,190
多谢这次的支援
Thanks for the backup.

350
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,610
如果下次我不能赶到
If I'm not there next time...

351
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,380
我希望你有所准备
I want you to be prepared.

352
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,380
这可不是标准制式武器
Not exactly standard issue.

353
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,610
我该问问你从哪儿弄到这些的吗
Should I ask where you got these?

354
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,580
最好不要问
Probably best if you don't.

355
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,420
你准备重返伊拉克还是怎么着
You getting shipped back to Iraq or something?

356
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,000
我需要个帮手
I need an assist.

357
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,260
我让你多带的防弹衣和弹药带了没
Did you bring the extra vest and ammo like I told you?

358
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,170
带了
Yeah.

359
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,750
上车
Just get in.

360
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,850
你是我现在唯一能信任的警察了
You're the only cop I can trust right now.

361
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,630
我跟的是什么人  芬奇
Who am I looking at, Finch?

362
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
我查了从以利亚账户转出的
I was able to trace the financial transactions

363
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
财务交易记录
coming out of Elias's accounts.

364
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,250
你跟的就是其中一个收款人
The man you're following is one of the recipients.

365
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,650
以利亚的付款单就像
Elias's payroll reads

366
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,920
美国刑事系统名人录
like a who's who of the US penal system.

367
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,840
我在跟着他
I'm following him.

368
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,460
那他在跟着谁
But who's he following?

369
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,190
是一家人
It's a family.

370
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,450
知道他们是谁吗
Any idea who they are?

371
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,700
也许他们和黑帮头目们有关
Maybe they're related to the dons.

372
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,080
以利亚可不惮威胁别人的挚爱
Elias isn't above threatening their loved ones.

373
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,240
理论正确
Right theory.

374
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,730
对象错误
Wrong organization.

375
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,760
以利亚的人在跟踪HR的家人  芬奇
Elias's people are following HR families, Finch.

376
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
我不明白他的策略
I don't understand his strategy.

377
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,720
HR跟他是一边的
HR are his allies.

378
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,460
在战争里  你必须像掌控敌人一般
In war, you need to be able to coerce your allies

379
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,050
牢牢掌控你的同盟
every bit as much as your enemies.

380
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,180
也就是说任何一名警方的内应
Which means if any of his law enforcement contacts

381
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,480
出了问题  他都有备用计划
gets out of line, he has a backup plan.

382
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,190
要我也这么做
That's what I would do.

383
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,280
如果你从一开始就听我的
If you had listened to me to begin with

384
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,950
我们就能在他绑架我父亲之前抓到他
we could have gotten him before he went after my father.

385
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,190
警探
Detectives.

386
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,420
什么风把你们吹来我们这个小俱乐部了
What's so important you bully your way into our club?

387
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,860
你们被保护性监禁了
You're going into protective custody

388
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
直到找到以利亚为止
until we can find Elias.

389
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,110
没这个必要吧
I don't think so.

390
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,210
这不是跟你们商量
It's not really up for discussion.

391
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,260
你搞不定他
You've failed to control this man.

392
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,240
你们有人企图跟他做交易
Some of you tried to cut deals with him.

393
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,990
结果现在他在追杀你们
And now he's coming after you.

394
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,270
我不会任由无辜民众惨遭杀害
I'm not gonna stand by and let innocent civilians get killed

395
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,440
就因为你们这些人无视眼前的事实
because you chose to ignore what was right in front of your nose.

396
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,450
吉米
Jimmy!

397
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,200
送警探们出去
Come show the detectives out.

398
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,690
你在干嘛  睡着了吗
What are you, sleeping?

399
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,450
吉米
Jimmy!

400
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,750
看来你们的小弟都抛弃了你们
Looks like your boys abandoned you.

401
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,300
想赌赌看以利亚的人是否就在不远处吗
You wanna bet Elias's men aren't far behind?

402
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,500
我们不和条子合作
We don't work with cops.

403
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,750
你们不想自愿跟我们走吗
You don't wanna come voluntarily,

404
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,850
那我们就要来硬的了
we're gonna take you by force.

405
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,910
你准备开枪打我吗
What are you gonna shoot us?

406
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,710
如果我打死你  那也许以利亚
If I shoot you, then maybe Elias

407
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,260
就不用炸飞整车的无辜市民
won't have to blow up a carload of innocent people.

408
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,780
我们要不要叫支援
Hey, shouldn't we call for backup?

409
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,840
你就是我的支援
You are my backup.

410
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,130
以利亚的人来了
Here come Elias's guys.

411
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,140
你好
Hello?

412
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,810
找你的
It's for you.

413
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,050
你好
Hello?

414
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,990
左转过两条街后去总统大街954号
Turn left and go two blocks to 954 president street.

415
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,120
真及时
You got good timing.

416
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,450
-下个路口左转  弗斯科  -上二楼
- Next left, Fusco. - Go to the second floor.

417
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,750
-密码是3288  -收到
- The code is 3288. - Got it.

418
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,020
这是谁的地方
Who owns this place again?

419
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,700
一个朋友
A friend.

420
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,270
你真有些诡异的朋友  卡特
You got some weird friends, Carter.

421
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,700
我不太记得我妈妈了
I don't remember a lot about my mom.

422
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,050
她死的时候我只有四岁
I was four when she died.

423
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,280
当然  这些你都知道
Of course, you know that.

424
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,570
但我经常想起一些她的片段
But every so often I get these images of her,

425
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,370
特别是当我闻到她的香水味时
especially when I smell her perfume.

426
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,840
应该是"一千零一夜"
Shalimar, I think.

427
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,840
{\an8}娇兰经典款香水

428
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,750
她有着黝黑的秀发
She had dark hair.

429
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,580
和蔼的眼神
Kind eyes.

430
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,990
其它的时候我只能想起那些血
Other times I just see the blood.

431
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,030
那么娇小的人  却流了那么多的血
Just so much blood from such a small person.

432
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,190
出了点问题  老大
There was a problem, boss.

433
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,880
那个警探  你想要干掉的那个
The detective-- the one you wanted gone.

434
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,820
她带走了他
She took him.

435
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,700
-哪个人  -所有人
- Which one? - All of them.

436
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,010
知道了
I see.

437
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,650
这次我们需要警方的朋友
We'll need our friends on the police force

438
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,850
跟我们合作了
to join us on this one.

439
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,820
卡特和弗斯科警探都安然无恙地
Detectives Carter and Fusco are both safe and sound

440
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,510
待在我的地盘  里瑟先生
at one of my properties, Mr. Reese.

441
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,740
剩下的黑帮头目们也在
As are the remaining dons.

442
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,060
很好  芬奇
Good to hear, Finch.

443
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,170
她怎么说服他们和她走的
How'd she convince him to go with her?

444
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,650
她没有  她直接绑架了他们
She didn't. She kidnapped them.

445
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,710
看来她受你影响了  里瑟先生
It seems you've had something of an influence on her, Mr. Reese

446
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,810
多谢夸奖  芬奇
Thanks, Finch.

447
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,830
我可不是在表示赞赏
I'm not certain I meant that as a compliment.

448
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,440
以利亚不会善罢甘休的  芬奇
Elias isn't gonna take this lying down, Finch.

449
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,760
还没他的线索  但我已经锁定了他很多手下
No sign of him yet, but I've tracked down a dozen of his men

450
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,660
他们都处于一旦事情有变  可以随时攻击
All positioned to strike against the families of HR cops

451
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,020
HR警察家人的位置
if things don't go his way.

452
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,250
幸好HR不知道黑帮头目们何在
Luckily HR doesn't know where the Dons are.

453
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,720
只有卡特和弗斯科知道
Only Carter and Fusco do.

454
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,540
芬奇
Finch...

455
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,710
我们跟踪的人中
The men that we're tracking...

456
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,490
有没有正在布鲁克林马伯里高中附近的
Are any of them near Marbury high school in Brooklyn?

457
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,900
有  怎么了
Yes, why?

458
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,920
卡特的儿子在那里上学
That's where Carter's son goes to school.

459
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,880
是什么事故  我妈妈没事吧
What was the accident? Is my mom gonna be all right?

460
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,270
现在还说不准
It's too soon to tell.

461
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,920
不过我会马上带你去医院
But I'll take you right to the hospital.

462
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,920
{\an8}未知号码

463
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,090
-喂  -泰勒
- Hello? - Taylor?

464
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,870
你不认识我  但你现在有危险
You don't know me, but you are in danger

465
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,750
你必须待在学校里
and I want you to stay inside the school

466
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,680
找个老师陪着你  等我们过去
with a teacher until we can get to you.

467
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,020
泰勒
Taylor?

468
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,160
别出声  否则要你好看
Just keep quiet, and you won't get hurt.

469
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,190
出示你的通行证
Hey, I need to see your pass!

470
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,180
我们得在这里待多久
How long you think we can stay here?

471
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,390
待到确定他们安全
Until we know they're safe.

472
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,910
他们可是黑帮老大  卡特
They're mob bosses, Carter.

473
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,810
可有的等了
That ain't gonna happen any time soon.

474
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,180
没搞错吧
You've gotta be kidding me.

475
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,210
以利亚的手下是怎么找到我们的
How did Elias's men find us?

476
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,940
我还以为你把他们甩开了
I thought you shook them off.

477
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,710
我甩开了  甩得干干净净
I did, we were free and clear.

478
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,460
有什么消息
What do you have?

479
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,090
卡特  我得告诉你件事
Carter, I need to tell you something.

480
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,990
你一定要知道  我不会让他出事的
You've gotta know I'm not gonna let anything happen to him.

481
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,290
明白吗  我会找到他的
You understand? I'll find him.

482
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,820
找到谁  发生什么事了  约翰
Find who? What's going on, John?

483
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,400
{\an8}来电
泰勒

484
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,630
泰勒
Taylor?

485
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,180
泰勒
Taylor?

486
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,470
你有个乖儿子  警探
You got a great kid here, Detective.

487
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,750
我发誓  你敢动他一根汗毛  我会杀了你
I swear to god, if you touch him I'll kill you.

488
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,800
你有办法救回他
You have the means to set him free.

489
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,310
你没法呼叫支援
You can't call for backup.

490
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,300
你还能相信谁呢
Who you gonna trust anymore?

491
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,520
你知道我不能把他们交给你
You know I can't hand these guys over to you.

492
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,100
那等于亲手杀了他们
I might as well kill them myself.

493
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,310
你如果这么做  那可帮了我一个大忙
If you're up to it, that would be extremely helpful.

494
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,730
你为什么要那些老大们死  以利亚
Why do you need the bosses dead, Elias?

495
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,880
你已经展示了你的威力
You've already shown how powerful you are.

496
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,110
你不明白自己在保护何等的魔鬼  是吗
You don't understand the evil you're protecting, do you?

497
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,120
让我帮你普及一下桑布拉诺的知识
Let me tell you something about Zambrano.

498
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,210
他靠向学生卖海洛因为生
He earns his living by selling heroin to schoolchildren.

499
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,370
格里福尼贩卖枪支  谁出钱给谁
Grifoni sells guns to the highest bidder.

500
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,260
我那道貌岸然同父异母的弟弟
My esteemed half-brother,

501
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,060
他不仅经手毒品
a man who not only imports drugs,

502
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,230
还贩卖少女
but young girls.

503
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,270
那就是你在保护的人
These are the men that you are protecting.

504
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,190
你管辖之下  一切都会更美好吗
Things would be much better under your watch, huh?

505
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,860
我掌管的组织高效运转
I run an efficient enterprise.

506
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,620
没有内讧  没有地盘争夺
There's no infighting, there's no conflict over territory.

507
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,480
我是有组织犯罪的进化版
I am the evolution of organized crime.

508
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,970
你堕落和懦弱的推动者
You're a force of corruption and weakness.

509
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,620
我的回答是  不
My answer is no.

510
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,720
他想要用泰勒换黑帮头目们
He wants to trade Taylor for the Dons.

511
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,910
-我怎么可以  -你不可以
- How can I do that? - You can't.

512
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,410
但你不必做出取舍
But you don't have to make that decision,

513
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,520
因为我会把你儿子救回来
Because I'm gonna get your son back.

514
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,440
不惜一切代价
No matter what the cost.

515
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,440
我不会让任何人伤害他
I won't let anyone hurt him.

516
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,500
明白吗  卡特
You hear me, Carter?

517
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,260
你保证
Promise me.

518
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,100
我发誓
You have my word.

519
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,750
芬奇  告诉我去哪里找那男孩
Finch, I need you to tell me where to find the boy.

520
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,980
已经在找了  里瑟先生
I'm a step ahead of you, Mr. Reese.

521
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,000
找到泰勒的唯一办法就是和魔鬼做交易
The only way to locate Taylor is to make a deal with the devil

522
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,450
我希望你指的不是以利亚
I hope you're not referring to Elias.

523
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,990
以利亚并非联络名单上唯一的堕落天使
Elias isn't the only fallen angel in our rolodex,

524
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,890
里瑟先生
Mr. Reese.

525
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,090
你还好吗  卡特
You okay, Carter?

526
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,510
他们抓走了我儿子
They got my kid.

527
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,480
你确定不要支援来这里吗
You sure not calling backup's the way to go here?

528
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,870
你不明白  弗斯科
You don't get it, Fusco.

529
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,250
看到穿西装的那两个人了吗
You see those two in the suits?

530
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,480
他们是15局风化组的
They work VICE at the 15th.

531
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,570
他们在这儿是为了帮以利亚
They're here to help Elias,

532
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,700
不是支援我们
not back us up.

533
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,130
你想要怎么做
What do you wanna do?

534
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,420
等着
Wait.

535
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,320
确保这里已经完全封锁
Make sure this place is sealed off.

536
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,010
行  我去彻底检查一下
Okay. I'll do a sweep,

537
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,170
保证这儿滴水不漏
and make sure it's airtight.

538
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,500
你应该是我们的领路人  卡特警探
You should have been our wheel-man, Detective Carter.

539
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,290
但你的搭档令人不敢恭维
I don't think your partner had it in him.

540
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,370
别去怪弗斯科  与他无关
Don't go blaming Fusco, this isn't on him.

541
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,560
你确定吗
You sure about that?

542
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,690
我可是隐约记得
Because I got this vague recollection...

543
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,780
你的搭档以前拿过脏钱
that your partner used to be on the take.

544
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,720
实际上  我再仔细想想
In fact now that I think about it,

545
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,780
就完全确定了
I'm sure of it.

546
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,010
他以前和那个  斯蒂尔斯警探合作  是吧
He was partners with that, Detective Stills, right?

547
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,180
那个涉嫌贪污  失踪数月的警察
That dirty cop who went missing a few months back?

548
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,830
那些人在城里的各种勾当中都插了一脚
Those guys had their paws around every game in town.

549
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,050
他们全都拿过脏钱
All of them on the take.

550
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,850
他们无所谓  因为只要扔些烂仔进去
And they didn't care because they'd just throw a piece upstairs

551
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,330
什么低层的毒贩啦  皮条客啦
you know, shaking down low-life drug dealers, pimps,

552
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,170
无所不用其极
whatever scratch they could get.

553
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,090
他们甚至搞过暗杀
They even did some wet work.

554
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,450
你好  警探
Hello, Detective.

555
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,040
我亲自来谈谈
I've come to talk it over in person.

556
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,050
你选好边站了吗
Are you ready to pick the right side?

557
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,400
你好  西蒙斯警官
Hello, Officer Simmons.

558
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,320
我能否占用你几分钟时间
I wonder if I might have a few minutes of your time.

559
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,070
你是什么人
Who the hell are you?

560
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,300
告诉我你是谁  还是要我逮捕你
You gonna tell me who you are or do I have to arrest you?

561
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,640
我想和你谈谈你的组织
I'd like to talk to you about your organization.

562
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,290
就是俗称的HR
The one commonly referred to as HR.

563
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,830
我注意到HR被一大笔钱收买
It's come to my attention that HR has been paid

564
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,080
从而对所有牵涉到
a large sum of money to ignore

565
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,580
以利亚这个人的犯罪活动都视而不见
any criminal activities involving a man named Elias.

566
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,440
是吗
Really?

567
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,050
你又是怎么注意到这个消息的
And how exactly did this come to your attention?

568
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,820
我会注意到一些事  警官
I notice things, officer.

569
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,720
一些被其他人忽视的事
Things the rest of the world ignores.

570
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,430
我还注意到一些关于以利亚的事
And I've noticed things about Elias

571
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
我相信你一定忽视了
that I believe you've overlooked.

572
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,880
我可不信
I doubt that.

573
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,040
我的洞察力相当不错
I'm a pretty observant guy myself.

574
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,740
你以为以利亚代表了
You think Elias stands for a return

575
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,090
旧规则的回归
to the way things used to be.

576
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,800
一个组织控制所有的黑帮
A firm hand on the reins of organized crime.

577
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
但他同时也代表了别的东西
But he also stands for other things.

578
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,490
这是以利亚对HR警官
This is Elias's surveillance of HR police officers

579
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,430
及他们家人的监控照片
and their families.

580
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,780
你在与魔鬼共舞
You're in bed with the devil.

581
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,640
此人为达目的  不择手段
This man will go to any length to get what he wants,

582
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,280
甚至不惜绑架儿童
including kidnapping children.

583
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,820
卡特警探的儿子只是他最新的受害人
Detective Carter's son is only his most recent victim.

584
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,050
我没听说过这个
I didn't hear anything about that.

585
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,020
我知道  警官  我现在
Look, I recognize, Officer, that I'm placing myself

586
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,510
跟你同桌而坐是在拿自己冒险
in danger by sitting here with you.

587
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,130
我希望你明白  你现在
I need you to understand that you're placing

588
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,630
跟以利亚做交易是在拿你的家人冒险
your family in danger by doing business with Elias.

589
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,570
这是什么东西
What the hell is this?

590
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,080
监视你妻子的人前科累累
The man following your wife is an ex-con

591
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,170
他的主要罪名包括强奸  过失杀人
whose prior convictions include rape, manslaughter...

592
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,760
以利亚牢牢控制着你和你的家人
Elias is keeping you and yours in check...

593
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,900
直到他的计划得以完成
Until his plan is finished.

594
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,760
而完成之后
After that...

595
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,190
他对你是否有别的打算就不得而知了
who knows whether he'll have any use for you.

596
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,600
我怎么知道这个人不是你的手下
How do I know this guy doesn't work for you, huh?

597
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,080
我想你不知道
I imagine you don't.

598
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,880
但你真的愿意拿你家人的生命当赌注吗
But are you really willing to bet your family's life on it?

599
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,410
你想怎么样
What do you want?

600
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,800
帮我找到关押卡特警探儿子的地方
You need to get me the location of Detective Carter's son.

601
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,460
然后撤掉你手下为以利亚卖命的所有人
Call off any men you have working on Elias's behalf.

602
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,500
从此刻开始  HR与以利亚一刀两断
HR severs its ties with Elias as of this moment.

603
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,600
我可不会在这等上整晚  警探
Not gonna wait all night, detective.

604
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,940
放了他  以利亚
Let him go, Elias.

605
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,360
他与此事无关
He's got no part in this.

606
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,150
泰勒看起来是个不错的小伙子
Taylor seems like a very nice young man.

607
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,460
我也不想伤害他
I'd rather not hurt him.

608
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,030
你必须接受现实
You need to accept the fact

609
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,390
没人会来救你的  你在孤军奋战
that no one's coming to save you -- you are all alone.

610
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,320
我想  我想就在那边了
I think -- I think it's right up over here.

611
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,860
简直比带上黄铜胸罩的巫婆奶头还冷
Colder than a witch's nip in a brass bra.

612
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,480
莫雷蒂头目在哪儿
Where's Don Moretti?

613
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,260
你说呢  小子
Yeah, you tell me, kid.

614
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,290
老大让我转告你
Well, the boss wanted me to tell you

615
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,360
他也希望他能来
he wished he could be here...

616
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,220
但是他有事来不了了
but he couldn't make it.

617
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,130
-走吧  -说到黄铜[厚颜无耻]
- Come on.  - Talk about brass.

618
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,870
以前那些头目们都是自己擦屁股的
Used to be the Dons would clean up their own mess.

619
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,990
莫雷蒂根本没种过来
Moretti didn't have the stones to be here.

620
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,140
德卢卡告诉我
You know, Deluca told me

621
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,750
他以前让他把那娘们儿干掉
he made him get rid of the broad back in the day.

622
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,480
现在又让我们来处理这倒霉杂种
Now we gotta deal with this miserable bastard.

623
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,890
搞什么名堂
For crying out loud.

624
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,450
这家伙还哭上了
Here come the waterworks.

625
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,490
怎么着  小子
What's the matter, kid?

626
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,190
不是你期待的阖家团聚吗
Not the family reunion you were hoping for?

627
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,400
我真蠢呀  我早该想到了
What an idiot, I should have known.

628
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,110
是啊  头目已经有了一个傻逼儿子了
Yeah, well, the Don's already got one idiot kid.

629
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,470
我猜他也不需要第二个了
Guess he didn't need another one.

630
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,600
你俩觉得自己很安全  因为是两个对一个
You two think you're safe because there's just one of me.

631
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,890
我很弱  你们俩却很壮
That I'm weak and that you're strong.

632
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,510
那不是力量
That's not strength.

633
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,070
而是软弱
That's weakness.

634
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,760
看看你们  两个心怀嫉妒的蠢货
Look at you...a bunch of jealous idiots.

635
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,050
背叛彼此的骗子
Liars, betraying each other.

636
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,950
我不需要这些
I don't need that.

637
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,690
我的力量源自孤寂
I get my strength from being alone,

638
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,750
我将以此毁掉你们所有人
and that's why I'm gonna destroy all of you.

639
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,940
把他的嘴给我堵上  行不
Shut him up already, will ya?

640
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,260
拜托  帮个忙呀  小杂种
Come on, help me out! Little bastard!

641
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,040
这就是他们囚禁泰勒的地方
This is where they're holding Taylor.

642
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,000
你有什么计划  约翰
What's your plan, John?

643
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,290
没有计划
No plan.

644
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,900
我就准备单刀直入
I'll just take the direct approach.

645
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,830
抱歉我在这方面就帮不上什么忙了
I'm sorry I'm not much use on this end of things.

646
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,780
这样吧
Look...

647
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,940
教我怎么用枪  我就可以帮得上忙了
show me how to fire one of these and I can help.

648
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,670
我可以
I'll...

649
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,590
转移他们的注意力  或者
create a distraction, I suppose, or...

650
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,890
别担心  哈罗德
That's okay, Harold.

651
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,020
你可以当我的接应司机
You can be the getaway driver.

652
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,100
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

653
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,060
再说了  你知道我最恨有人对孩子下手
Besides, you know I don't like it when people mess with kids

654
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,380
最后一次机会了  警探
Last chance, detective.

655
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,620
邪恶腐败的家伙们  还是你无辜的儿子
Those immoral, corrupt men or your innocent son.

656
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,620
做梦
No deal.

657
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,090
-你准备怎么办  -我就守在这
- What are you gonna do?  - I'm staying right here.

658
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,990
他们别想从我这过去
They're not getting past me.

659
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,680
我并不如你所想的那般孤军奋战
I'm not as alone as you think!

660
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,760
-你没事吧  -没事
- Are you okay?  - Yeah.

661
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,280
你是谁
Who are you?

662
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,520
我叫约翰
My name is John.

663
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,110
你妈妈派我来的
Your mother sent me.

664
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,930
你是来救我的
You here to rescue me?

665
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,080
还是来杀我的
Or shoot me?

666
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,680
今晚
Tonight...

667
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,400
救人
rescue.

668
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,910
卡特
Carter.

669
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,910
那些HR警察走了
Those HR cops just took off.

670
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,830
把那些头目们护在后面
Keep the Dons in the back.

671
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,180
你耳聋啦  退后
Hey, you heard the lady. Get back.

672
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,680
开门  警探
Open the door, detective.

673
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,070
我早该猜到了
I should have known.

674
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,790
说什么要跟以利亚分一杯羹
All that nonsense about bringing Elias into the fold.

675
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,200
你简直是耻辱  内鬼
You're an embarrassment! A rat!

676
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,870
以利亚给出的条件很好
Elias offered me a deal.

677
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,760
识时务者为俊杰
When change comes, you gotta adapt.

678
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,940
你和你老爸  从来就不懂
You and your old man, you never learned that lesson.

679
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,090
把枪放下  桑布拉诺
Drop it, Zambrano.

680
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,230
你先放我出去
Not until you let me out of here.

681
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,950
你就应该乖乖听以利亚的话
You should have given Elias everything he wanted

682
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,010
就像其他警察一样
like the rest of them.

683
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,900
我不会睁只眼闭只眼
I don't look the other way.

684
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,230
是啊  可是你的搭档会
Yeah, but your partner does.

685
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,740
对吧
Right...

686
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,040
弗斯科
Fusco?

687
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,340
你很清楚  三十秒后  这个城市
You see, in less than 30 seconds there's a guy

688
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,200
未来的话事人就会冲进来
that's gonna come into this room that's gonna run this city.

689
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,580
你是识时务的
You're a survivor.

690
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,370
你要选对边站
You gonna choose the right side?

691
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,670
还是跟你的搭档一起死在这
Or are you gonna die alone here with your partner?

692
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,060
站住  以利亚
Not one more step, Elias.

693
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,960
叫你的手下把枪放下
Tell your boys to put down their weapons...

694
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,870
不然他们的下场就会跟那边的桑布拉诺一样
or their day will end like Zambrano's over here.

695
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,080
你的工作很出色  警探
You're good at your job, detective.

696
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,920
我的工作也一样
I'm good at mine.

697
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,150
我希望我们能避免更多的流血事件
I was hoping we could avoid further bloodshed.

698
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,400
这就是结局了
This is where it ends.

699
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,010
此地  此时
Right here, right now.

700
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,660
我叫了支援
I called for backup.

701
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,870
你总得信任某些人  卡特
You gotta trust somebody, Carter.

702
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,050
这家伙并没有买通所有的警察
This guy doesn't own every cop.

703
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,520
趴下  趴下
Get down, get down!

704
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,940
卡尔・以利亚  你被捕了
Carl Elias, you are under arrest.

705
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,810
至于你的罪名  我得回头慢慢算
I'll have to check my notes for the list of charges,

706
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,450
但是首要的就是谋杀和绑架
but murder and kidnapping are at the top.

707
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,110
你是无法改变历史的必然  警探
You can't stop the inevitable, detective.

708
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,360
不管你接受与否  改变总是会发生的
Change will happen whether you embrace it or not.

709
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,460
我父亲在哪里
Where is my father.

710
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,340
你死定了
You're dead.

711
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,480
甚至不会有人记得你曾活过
No one's ever gonna remember you even existed!

712
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,670
你一无是处  听见了吗
You're nothing, you hear me?

713
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,460
-说话  -妈妈  是我
- Talk to me.  - Mom, it's me.

714
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,290
泰勒  你没事吧
Taylor. Are you okay?

715
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,330
你派过来的这个人可真不是好惹的
That guy you sent is kind of a bad-ass.

716
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,950
是啊  他自己也知道
Yeah, he knows it too.

717
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,460
那个戴眼镜的人是谁
Who's the guy with the glasses?

718
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,600
如果你发现了  别忘了告诉我
If you find out, let me know.

719
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,350
你在哪
Where are you?

720
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,430
我很安全
I'm safe.

721
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,760
待会见
I'll see you soon.

722
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,180
好吧
Okay.

723
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,860
很高兴你遵守了誓言
Good to know you keep your promises.

724
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,450
我说过  我不会让你儿子出事的
I told you I'd never let anything happen to your son.

725
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,710
谢谢
Thank you.

726
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,130
眼镜摘掉
Glasses off.

727
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,640
出生日期
Birth date?

728
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,290
1965年8月18日
August 18, 1965.

729
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,000
社保号码

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,090
306003894
306-00-3894.

731
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,450
你回来真好  爸爸
It's good to have you back, pop.

732
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,880
回来真好
It's good to be back.

733
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,310
回家吧  儿子
Let's go home, son.

734
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,240
喂
Hello?

735
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,760
你好  爸爸
Hi, dad.

736
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,740
你以为这样就能吓到我吗
What, is this somehow supposed to intimidate me?

737
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,950
我只是想跟你道个别
I just wanted to say good-bye...

738
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,940
真希望我能在现场
and that I wish I could have been there.
