1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,870
哦…我的颈部垫圈！
... O-oh, my head gasket.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,320
啊 这什么鬼地方？
Eh... what the?

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,450
虎子的战舰？
The Cons' warship?

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,040
救护车 别问我怎么来的…说来话长
Ratchet? Don't ask how I got here. Long story.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,870
救护车？听到了吗？
Ratchet? You copy?

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,110
噢 见鬼
Oh scrap!

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,720
悄悄地过去 打枪地不要…
Stealthy... stealthy...

8
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,860
红蜘蛛？
Starscream?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,430
为什么每次我回到我的旧基地
Why is it that every time I return to my old stomping grounds

10
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,590
都能发现有汽车人在大厅里闲逛！
I find an Autobot roaming the halls?

11
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,020
别告诉我你爬回来找威震天了
Don't tell me you came crawling back to Megatron.

12
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,130
不可能！别挡路！
Hardly. Now out of my way.

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,770
小红 你得告诉我离开这里的路
Scream. You've got to show me the way off this boat.

14
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,490
对不起 没时间！
Sorry, too busy.

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,520
别忘了 上次你落难的时候…
Look. When you needed help...

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,770
我记得 我们是公平交易
As I recall, we bartered.

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,580
所以 除非你能提供回报
So, unless you have anything of value to offer me

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,940
否则一边去！
step aside!

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,690
立马告诉我出口！
The exit. Now!

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,850
虽然上次我放过了阿尔茜
I may have given Arcee a free pass when she and I last met!

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,290
但我也可以毫不迟疑地刺穿你 就像对飞过山一样
But I won't hesitate to skewer you as I did a certain Cliffjumper!

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,000
去死吧 隔板！
Perish, Bulkhead!

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,400
这是为了飞过山！为了大黄蜂！为了你所做的一切！
This is for Cliffjumper! For Bumblebee! For everything.

24
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,240
这是你逼我的…
You left me no choice...

25
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,140
我愿不惜一切代价再次飞起来…
Argh! What I would not give to have wings again!

26
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,580
啊… 跟我离开时一样
Just as I left it.

27
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,800
先驱号的事情终于有了转机
The Harbinger. Things are finally looking up.

28
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,330
噢 真的假的？！一丁点能量残渣都不剩？
Oh really!? Not one scrap of energon!

29
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,900
一个实验室？
A laboratory.

30
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,460
并且还能运作…
And it's functional.

31
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,760
原生体…
Protoforms?

32
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,300
隔板呼叫基地 发现一个很强的信号
Bulkhead to base. Picked up a strong reading.

33
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,660
我去调查清楚
I'm going to check it out.

34
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,340
让我们看看 分子内二价键连接
Let's see... Transference of binary bonding, submolecular infusion, hmm...

35
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,000
这个方程式很容易弄懂
The formula seems straightforward enough.

36
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,150
好了 我的粘土小人儿 看来你们已经准备好塑形了…
Well, my little lambs of clay, you look like alright for the molding.

37
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,000
…我们来个快速克隆 怎么样？
Let's give cloning a whirl, shall we?

38
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,300
没有活动的迹象
No sight of activity.

39
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,540
哈哈哈哈…
Hahahahaha...

40
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,100
…赐予我生命吧！
Give me a light!

41
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,030
啊…同志们…终于找到组织了…
Like-minded company... at last.

42
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,740
能量体…打包待运？
Energon? Boxed and ready for pickup?

43
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,310
糟了！
... Scrap!

44
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,570
我亲爱的成员们
Esteemed members of my armada!

45
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,360
你们即将见证
You now stand upon the very precipice of glory

46
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,950
我长久以来不懈追求的光荣时刻
to meet the destiny which I have so tenaciously worked toward.

47
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,850
霸天虎的领导权应该轮流坐庄！
Dynamic leadership of the Decepticons!

48
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,360
我…很高兴咱们达成了共识 呵呵
I am... delighted to hear that we are on the same page, heh.

49
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,570
我们是一体的 指挥官
We are as one, Commander.

50
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,170
我们分享你的记忆
We share your memories.

51
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,330
你的切身感受
Your very feelings.

52
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,750
甚至你对权力无尽的渴求!
Even your insatiable quest for power.

53
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,270
我知道了
I see.

54
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,260
很幸运 先驱号的追踪系统还能
Fortunately, The Harbinger's tracking systems

55
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,090
追踪到威震天的飞船
have remained synced with Megatron's warship.

56
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,050
当然我们要先想个办法登上去
Of course, we shall require a means of reaching the...

57
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,310
啊？你们能变形？
Oh! You can transform!?

58
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,780
你们当然能变形！
... Of course you can!

59
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,500
否则怎么飞到飞船上去？
How else would you fly to the ship.

60
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,220
我只是想考验一下 你们都通过了
That was a test which you all... eh... passed.

61
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,880
现在飞过去熄灭威震天那被诅咒的火种！
Now take flight and snuff Megatron's accursed Spark!

62
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,060
哦…我的颈部垫圈！
... O-oh, my head gasket.

63
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,390
散开 保持隐蔽
Spread out. Keep to the shadows.

64
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,560
我们中任何一人被发现都会立刻受到攻击的
Any one of us is an instant target aboard this warship.

65
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,610
但要是被看到我们在一起 就没有奇袭效果了
But to be seen together would sacrifice the element of surprise.

66
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,480
无论是谁先找到了威震天 报告你的位置
Whoever manages to find Megatron first, report your position!

67
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,110
红蜘蛛？
Starscream?

68
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,100
我迫不及待地等着欣赏威震天死亡的场面
I cannot wait to savour the vivid details of Megatron's demise...

69
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,390
啊
Ah!

70
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,370
到底怎么回事？
What is happening?!

71
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,030
这是为了飞过山！为大黄蜂！为了你所做的一切！
This is for Cliffjumper! For Bumblebee! For everything.

72
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,610
啊！
Ahhhhh...

73
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,520
我的遗传代码给了克隆体们我早已失去的变形齿轮！
My genetic code provides my clones with a T-cog I no longer possess

74
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,870
而我得到的竟是他们的痛苦？
and all I get is their agony?

75
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,620
通讯台！
A comm unit.

76
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,490
隔板呼叫基地 听到了吗？
Bulkhead to base. Do you read?

77
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,130
听得到吗？
Do you copy?

78
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,300
虎子的烂设备 就没有好使的吗？
Come on... Stupid 'Con tech! Is this thing even on?

79
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,350
站住！
Halt!

80
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,800
霸天虎信号 终于找到了！
A Decepticon beacon, at last.

81
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,290
忠诚的奴仆们 机会终于来了！
Devoted servants, the time has come.

82
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,200
为复仇而战吧
For the ultimate retribution.

83
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,650
擎天柱 没有隔板的消息
Optimus, no word yet from Bulkhead.

84
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,180
不过我监测到一些奇怪的地下信号
But I am detecting some rather curious subterranean frequencies.

85
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,070
地球人的吗？
Of Earthly origin?

86
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,720
我还不确定是什么 但我知道它的位置
I do not yet know what they are, but I do know where.

87
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,280
坐标是我们最后遇到威震天的地方…
The coordinates at which we last encountered Megatron.

88
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,630
还有毒蜘蛛
And Airachnid.

89
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,840
还有毒蜘蛛的机器昆虫
And Airachnid's Insecticon.

90
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,910
出洞吧 我的虫群们 攻击！
Arise, my armada. And attack!

91
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,400
我们看到的 极有可能是一次针对威震天的刺杀行动
We are in all likelihood witnessing the launch of a mission to terminate Megatron.

92
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,400
我想不出阻止它的理由
I can't think of a reason to stop that.

93
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,470
虽然我们做得到
Even if we could.

94
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,430
但是我们能阻止毒蜘蛛
But we can stop Airachnid.

95
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,110
后卫部队 向汽车人开火
Rear guard, engage the Autobots.

96
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,780
悄悄地过去 打枪地不要…
Stealthy... stealthy...

97
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,090
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron!

98
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,100
嗯 什么事？
Yes, what is it?

99
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,280
有入侵者！
An intruder.

100
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,360
汽车人？
Autobot?

101
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,620
是红蜘蛛 刚刚出现在舰桥附近
Starscream. He was last seen in vicinity of the bridge.

102
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,090
不！
No!

103
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,390
钻地 还是老把戏
Underground. There's a surprise.

104
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,130
威震天…是算旧账的时候了…
Megatron. It has come time to settle old scores.

105
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,800
哈哈哈哈 是吗 红蜘蛛? 就凭你一个人？
Hahahahaha... really, Starscream? All on your own?

106
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,520
事实上…
Actually...

107
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,780
克隆 干得不赖啊 红蜘蛛
Clones. Well-played, Starscream.

108
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,070
你可能根本没有跟这些喽罗一起来
If you're even here among your underlings.

109
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,640
喽罗？我们是一体的
Underlings? We are as one.

110
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,050
同时也是个军团
Though many.

111
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,630
把红蜘蛛的脑袋带给我
Bring me Starscream's head on a stick.

112
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,250
我就让你们都当我的副官
And I will reward you as my Second-in-command. All of you.

113
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,230
不 你在骗我们！
No! You're trying to trick us!

114
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,760
有吗？
Am I?

115
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,210
是吧?
Is he?

116
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,570
采纳我的提议 我们都会是赢家
Accept my proposal and we all win.

117
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,310
否则你们只会死于抢夺战利品的争斗之中
Otherwise, you will merely end up terminating each other to get the spoils.

118
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,050
毕竟那是你们的天性…
It is your nature, after all.

119
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,460
别听他的！
Don't listen to him!

120
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,870
准备死在我手上吧！
Prepare to perish at my hand!

121
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,100
我们的手上！
Our hands!

122
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,380
没错 只有我们集中火力才能确保威震天被消灭
Yes! Only our combined firepower will assure Megatron's destruction.

123
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,670
准备！
Take aim!

124
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,630
你们听到了吗？
Do you hear that?

125
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,160
别管它 数到3就开火！
Ignore! Fire on three!

126
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,770
1 2
One. Two!

127
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,320
刚才是什么声音？
What was that?

128
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,450
翻盘的声音
The sound of the tables turning.

129
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,800
那上面发生了什么？
What is going on up there?

130
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,430
前三次摧毁你还是很惬意的
Exterminating you was so gratifying the first three times!

131
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,930
毒蜘蛛？刺客们今天赶集吗？
Airachnid. A busy day for assassins.

132
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,270
阿尔茜
Arcee!

133
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,000
当你熄灭我火种的时候 做得痛苦点
When you extinguish my Spark, make it hurt.

134
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,380
你知道我会对你下更重的手
You know: I would extend the courtesy to you.

135
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,980
我可不像你
I'm not like you.

136
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,220
很好…
Very well.

137
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,520
不！
No!

138
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,740
原谅我们 真正的主人
Forgive us, one true Lord and Master.

139
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,830
今天南辕北辙的事真是够多了
This day has certainly seen its share of thwarted intentions.

140
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,200
无论如何 我都要离开这艘破船！
One way or another, I'm getting off this boat!

141
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,470
又怎么了！
Now what?!

142
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,250
好狗不挡道！
Out of my way!

143
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,450
我的君王 我们的动力设备被破坏了
My Liege! Our power core has been compromised.

144
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,510
准备着陆…
Prepare for landing.

145
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,410
休眠状态 便宜她了
Stasis. She deserves worse.

146
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,010
我的原计划可不会这么温柔 你想象不到的
I intended worse. More times than you know.

147
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,520
你的这一选择 会让你变得更为强大
You are stronger for the choice you made.

148
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,390
伙计们 你们绝对想不到我这一天的经历！
Guys, you're not gonna believe the day I had!

149
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,520
你也是 嗯？
You too, huh?

150
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,240
红蜘蛛陛下 您最忠实的仆人回来了
Lord Starscream! Your most loyal servant has returned.

151
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,370
但我很遗憾地通知您 我们的任务失败了
