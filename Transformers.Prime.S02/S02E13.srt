1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,060
在前面的故事里…
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,390
有一名霸天虎受到擎天柱的尊敬
There is one who Prime seems to respect.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,420
骇翼 你有另一个选择
Dreadwing, there is another path.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,070
你这样喋喋不休有意义吗 擎天柱？
Is there a point to your bluster, Prime?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,370
尽管下载到的铁堡数据不完整
The download of the Iacon database may have been incomplete

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,110
但我们已经拥有了战舰所破译的四个坐标
but we now possess four sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,590
如果我们想赶在霸天虎之前得到铁堡的遗物
If we are to have any hope of recovering the Iacon relics before the Decepticons do

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,060
我们就必须分头行动
we must divide our resources.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,890
但是擎天柱
But, Optimus

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,750
我们人手本来就不足…
when it comes to numbers, we are already at a grave disadvantage.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,290
派出多支小队
Dispatching multiple squadrons will enable us to pursue all four coordinates simultaneously.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,370
同时开始定位另外三组坐标
Triangulate coordinates of the other three relics.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,980
这是一场我们输不起的竞赛
This is one race that we absolutely cannot afford to lose.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,340
坐标显示第二个铁堡遗物位于
The coordinates indicate that the second of these four Iacon relics

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,330
这个世界的最底端
lies at the very bottom of this world.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,020
为了贯彻您的意志
I will journey to the ends of this or any world

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,420
我愿意前往任何世界的尽头 威震天陛下
to serve your will, lord Megatron.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,140
那就带着我的战利品回来 骇翼！
Then return with my prize, Dreadwing.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,480
向我证明 作为一个副官
and prove you are more worthy of being my second-in-command

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,710
你比你的前任更加称职
than those who have preceded you.

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,880
指数仪 十字钳 激光手术刀
Inner stat, cross clamp, laser scalpel

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,440
钻头 还有一个轻微损伤的变形齿轮
durabyllium drill, and one slightly damaged but operational T-cog.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,990
来自我那狡诈的克隆体
courtesy of my traitorous clone...

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,920
能够将我完全修复的设备一应俱全
everything I require to make myself whole.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,120
只是一个简单 无痛的手术
A simple, painless procedure.

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,830
真的没什么
Nothing to it, really.

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,320
只要有勇气
Provided one possesses the nerve.

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
嗯？
Hmm?

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,870
四支霸天虎分队同时经过环陆桥前往四个不同地点？
Four detachments of Decepticons Ground Bridging to four different continents at the exact same time?

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,500
啊…手术推迟！
Ah. Procedure postponed.

31
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,760
小心行事 隔板
Be on your guard, Bulkhead.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,070
拉斐尔 锁定其余坐标
Raphael, lock on to the remaining coordinates.

33
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,900
我将前往南极
I will embark for the Antarctic.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,360
至于你 我的老朋友
As for you, old friend

35
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,330
我想让一个人陪同你执行任务
I would prefer that you have company on your mission.

36
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,670
没有人能跟我同行了 擎天柱
No one is left to join me, Optimus.

37
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,330
即便福勒探员恢复意识
Even if Agent Fowler were alert...

38
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,280
嗯…在说我什么？
Em? Who's talking about me?

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,190
他也不过是个人类
He's human.

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,830
这个星球上还有一个汽车人 我想他是最终人选
I was considering the only remaining Autobot alternative on this planet.

41
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,150
等等 你不是认真的吧！
But, you... you can't be serious!

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,140
千斤顶桀骜不驯 粗俗无礼
Wheeljack is insubordinate, a ruffian.

43
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,640
更何况 他是隔板的搭档
Besides, he's Bulkhead's partner.

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,160
你的专长是科技
Your expertise is scientific

45
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,000
而千斤顶是个强大的战士
but Wheeljack is a highly capable warrior.

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,400
由他暂时陪同对你有好处
You would be wise to welcome the temporary alliance.

47
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,160
啊 操作环陆桥的遥控器
Ah, a remote control for the Ground Bridge.

48
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,550
我爱霸天虎的科学家
I love Decepticon scientists.

49
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,350
呃…我讨厌这个星球！
I despise this planet.

50
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,320
不是灼热的沙漠
If it isn't a scorching desert

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,860
就是寒冷的不毛之地！
it is a frigid wasteland.

52
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,390
好了 我的霸天虎兄弟们你们在哪儿？
Now, where are you, my Decepticon brethren?

53
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,610
啊！快跑啊 你这悲催的蠢玩意儿！
Faster, you pathetic excuse for transportation!

54
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,560
霸天虎！知道你们打下了自己的战舰指挥官吗？
Decepticons, do you not realize you have just shot down your ship's Commander?!

55
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,190
啊！
Aah!

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,060
你指挥不了任何人 叛徒！
You command no one, deserter.

57
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,470
天震？但是 你已经…！
Skyquake? B-but you're...

58
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,820
你把我和我兄弟搞混了
You mistake me for my brother

59
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,060
他已经与火种源同在了
who is one with the Allspark

60
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,300
你最清楚他怎么死的 前任指挥官 红蜘蛛…
as you are, no doubt, aware, former commander Starscream.

61
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,110
啊…哈…哈哈哈
Ahhh... Hahaha...

62
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,540
要是我能做得了主
Were it up to me

63
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,370
我立马就会在这里把你了结
I would end this here and now.

64
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,650
但是作为威震天陛下的副官
But it is my duty as first lieutenant to Megatron

65
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,830
将叛徒带给我的主人进行公正的审判
to render all traitors to my lord and master

66
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,430
是我的职责
for due punishment.

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,040
副官？
First lieutenant?!

68
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,730
那是我的官位！
That's my post!

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,470
呃 曾经 是我的
Uh, was my post.

70
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,090
骇翼指挥官
Commander Dreadwing

71
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,290
威震天会派他的副手来 一定是一项十分重要的任务
this must be a very important mission if Megatron has dispatched his second-in-command.

72
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,750
是搜寻能量 还是其他的什么事？
Scouting for Energon, or something else altogether?

73
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,130
与你无关
That is none of your concern.

74
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,630
要是告诉我你在找什么
If I knew what you were looking for

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,180
或许我能提供帮助
perhaps I could help.

76
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,010
我们已经到达了坐标地点
We have arrived at the coordinates.

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,200
遗物 已经被带走了！
The relic. It has been taken.

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,540
遗物？什么遗物？
Relic? What sort of relic?

79
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,410
搜索附近区域！
Search the area!

80
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
骇翼指挥官
Commander Dreadwing

81
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,790
发现车辆的痕迹
we have discovered vehicle tracks.

82
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,370
汽车人！
The Autobots.

83
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,160
虽然有可能 但我从来不知道
Perhaps. Though I've never known them to plant flags 

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,300
他们还会留下旗帜夸示胜利
at the site of their victories.

85
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,190
别挑战我的耐性 叛徒！
Do not try me, traitor.

86
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,290
我会把你抛尸在这片冻原上
I will leave your lifeless husk in this frozen waste.

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,630
你们两个 看着囚犯
You two, guard the prisoner.

88
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,380
擎天柱 我只说一次 交出遗物！
Optimus Prime, I will request only once that you surrender the relic.

89
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,860
我把这话还给你 骇翼
I was going to request the same of you, Dreadwing.

90
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,220
那看来我们在同一起跑线上
Then I would say that we are on equal footing

91
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,510
只不过 我们是五对一
were it not that there are five of us and only one of you.

92
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,240
是六 要是你给我解开这荒唐的手铐
Six, if you'd relieve me of these ridiculous manacles.

93
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,380
你的准头真差
Your aim is poor.

94
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,290
只是目标不同罢了！
That is a matter of perspective.

95
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,190
不！
No!

96
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,660
这样僵持下去我们能…怎么样？
A stalemate would leave us where?

97
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,150
骇翼指挥官！
Commander Dreadwing!

98
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,640
我们配合真默契！
What a team we make!

99
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,260
我很高兴你能获胜 擎天柱！
I am so glad that you prevailed, Optimus Prime!

100
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,450
那个可恶的骇翼差点杀了我！
That wretch Dreadwing was going to terminate me.

101
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,360
好了 只要你给我解开手铐
Now, if you could just remove my bonds

102
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,020
我就带你去遗物那里
I can lead you straight to the relic.

103
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,890
不解开你也得带我去
You will lead me there regardless.

104
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,170
哼 不客气…
Hmph. You're welcome.

105
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,850
讲点道理 擎天柱！
Be reasonable, Prime!

106
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,220
严寒会把我们的促动器都冻住的！
This cold will freeze both our actuators.

107
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,450
这里的温度很低 但不足以影响到我们的生理构造
The current temperatures are not extreme enough to affect our biology.

108
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,210
你不会有事的
You'll be fine.

109
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,700
没事 却不好过！
Fine but miserable.

110
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,580
真没想到 我为汽车人做了那么多
And I cannot believe that you take our alliances for granted.

111
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,400
你却毫不领情！
After all I have done for the Autobots...

112
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,780
帮助你恢复记忆
helping to restore your memory

113
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,080
救了阿尔茜一命
saving Arcee's life.

114
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,560
你偶尔向我们提供帮助
While you have at times proved beneficial to us

115
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,850
只不过是为了你自己的利益
it has been only to further your own interests.

116
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,120
好吧 但我们不可能都像你那样无私 不是吗？
Well, we can't all be as selfless as you, now, can we?

117
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,990
啊哈！如我所料
Aha, as I suspected...

118
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,330
人类…遗物肯定在这里
humans. We will find the relic here.

119
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,060
让我们夺回本属于我们的东西吧 啊！
So, let us reclaim what is rightfully ours. Aah!

120
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,830
我们不能就这样冲进一个人类设施\N去搜索塞博特恩的圣物
We cannot simply enter a human facility to search for Cybertronian relics.

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,130
哪怕是他们偷走的 也不行？
Not even if they stole it?

122
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,990
我也不能让无辜的人类面对一个危险的霸天虎！
Nor can I expose innocent humans to a dangerous Decepticon.

123
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,520
拉斐尔 福勒探员恢复知觉了吗？
Rafael, has Agent Fowler regained consciousness?

124
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,660
我在这儿 擎天柱 你那边是什么情况？
I'm here, Prime. What's your situation?

125
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,540
我需要进入一处考察站 就在我所在的位置
I require access to a research facility at my current coordinates.

126
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,890
让我联系一下
Let me make a call.

127
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,670
我们就这么干等着挨冻？
Are we really going to wait out here in the freezing cold

128
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,890
完全被人类官僚驱使？
completely at the mercy of human bureaucracy?!

129
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,150
基地已经清空了 擎天柱 尽量不要破坏设施
Base is clear, Prime. Try not to wreck the joint.

130
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,410
十分感谢 福勒探员
Many thanks, Agent Fowler.

131
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,710
遗物仍被封在冰中
The relic remained sealed in the ice.

132
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,970
虽然早知道你毫无羞耻之心 红蜘蛛
I knew you were of questionable honor, Starscream

133
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,770
但你竟然投靠汽车人
but aiding the Autobots

134
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,510
这是我容忍的极限了
that is a capital offense.

135
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,090
什么？
What?!

136
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,080
但是我 我特意给你留下了记号！
But I... I left tracks for you on purpose!

137
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,180
好让你来营救我！
so you could rescue me from my captor.

138
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,330
骇翼 我不会让你带走遗物的
Dreadwing, I cannot allow you to leave here with this relic.

139
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,380
我知道 擎天柱
I know that, Prime

140
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,290
但我不打算给你选择的余地！
but I do not intend to give you a choice.

141
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,510
如此兴师动众 这遗物必定非同凡响！
Given all the fuss, this relic must be truly special.

142
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,380
一件护甲 出自霸天虎之手
Armor... of Decepticon origin.

143
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,190
精锐护甲…
The Apex armor.

144
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,090
十分合身！
A perfect fit.

145
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,580
你竟敢染指本属于威震天陛下的东西？
You dare to claim that which rightfully belongs to Lord Megatron?

146
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,660
你能奈我何 指挥官？
And what do you intend to do about it, Commander?

147
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,900
现在你看起来没那么高大强壮了 不是吗？
Not so big and strong now, are you?

148
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:43,210
自从上次在飞过山身上打个洞以来 我还从没这么高兴过！
I haven't had this much fun since I punched that hole in Cliffjumper.

149
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,770
让我送你去见你心爱的双胞胎兄弟吧
Allow me to reunite you with your beloved twin.

150
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,270
而你 擎天柱
And you, Optimus Prime.

151
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,980
我要把你的火种活生生地敲出来
I will beat the living Spark out of you

152
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,800
这样我就不用再忍受你那装模作样的态度了！
just so I never again have to endure your pontificating.

153
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,230
骇翼 我们的战斗还未结束
Dreadwing, our battle remains unfinished

154
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,600
但如果我们不团结起来对付我们共同的敌人…
but if we do not unite against our common foe...

155
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,770
红蜘蛛会把我们都干掉
Starscream will destroy us both.

156
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,990
我去吸引他注意力
I will draw his attention.

157
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,990
力气大不怕你会飞！
Might beats flight.

158
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,080
你才该魂归火种源！
You shall be the one to join with the Allspark.

159
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,460
像挠痒痒一样 哈哈哈 蠢货们！
That tickled! Ahhhahaha... Fools!

160
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,050
本座现在不光是英明 而且神武！
Not only am I intelligent, I am invincible!

161
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,940
但是你不能飞！
Yet you cannot fly.

162
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,010
没有人是完美的
Nobody's perfect.

163
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,400
好了 告诉我另外三个遗物
Now, tell me of the other three relics.

164
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,760
是不是也像我这件闪亮的新装甲一样威力无穷？
Are they as powerful as my shiny new armor?

165
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,780
正是为了避免像你这样的人染指
They were hidden away precisely to keep them from the hands of those like you.

166
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,900
他的威力太强大了 擎天柱！后退！
He is far too powerful, Prime! Fall back!

167
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,340
懦夫
Cowards.

168
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,110
你们休想逃出我的掌心！
You will not escape my might.

169
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,390
等等
Wait.

170
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,500
你们想算计我？
You two are up to something.

171
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,900
现在 我们联手的目的已经达到了
Now that our alliance has served its purpose...

172
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,460
精锐护甲随着红蜘蛛一起消失了
Starscream is gone and the Apex armor with him.

173
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,980
没有了目标 还有必要继续打下去吗？
Is there really a need to renew battle when the goal has been lost?

174
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,110
我们还有别的账要算…
We have other unfinished matters.

175
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,470
我对天震没有恶意
I bore Skyquake no malice

176
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,340
我导致了他的死亡 我也很遗憾
and I regret the role I played in his demise

177
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,860
所以我也向你提出相同的请求
so I will appeal to you as I once did your twin...

178
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
离开霸天虎势力
turn your back on the Decepticon cause

179
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
协助我结束这场战争
and help me end this war.

180
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,390
为了你兄弟和所有牺牲的战士
For his sake, and for all who have fallen.

181
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,380
今天你救了我一命
You saved my life today.

182
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,200
下次见面我再杀你！
I will terminate you the next time we meet.

183
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,560
如此也罢 骇翼
So be it, Dreadwing.
