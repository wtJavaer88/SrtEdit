Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.82,0:16:13.74,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But it didn't,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.18,0:16:15.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,because I was the one who dropped his guard.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:01.07,0:17:04.70,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But greatness begins and ends with putting the team first,

Dialogue: 0,0:17:19.65,0:17:21.06,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe I'm just not good enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.87,0:17:28.33,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Next time Optimus advises you to stop,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:28.58,0:17:29.99,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,perhaps you should listen.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:30.33,0:17:31.36,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I'll bring him back.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:32.73,0:17:34.89,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Smokescreen is young, Bulkhead,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.02,0:17:36.37,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,and has much to learn,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:36.58,0:17:39.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but right now he needs to clear his thoughts.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:39.42,0:17:43.22,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And I need to finish decoding the final Iacon entry.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:53.42,0:17:56.57,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,By the time I reached the location, it was gone,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:56.71,0:17:58.59,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,as were the Autobots.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:58.75,0:18:04.55,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It would serve us well to not only decode the final Iacon entry before Optimus Prime does,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.72,0:18:08.48,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but to recapture those relics currently held by the Autobots.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:09.20,0:18:12.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Soundwave. Despite your primary task,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:13.17,0:18:17.67,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I trust that you have been making progress pinpointing the location of their base.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:23.29,0:18:27.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Good. Given the recent accumulation of evidence,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.13,0:18:31.05,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,we possess a clearer idea of where their human colleagues reside.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.64,0:18:37.03,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And Laserbeak should soon determine whether the Autobots dwell in proximity.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.86,0:18:47.79,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Ah. The final entry has been decoded.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:49.84,0:18:50.67,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Has it?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.18,0:18:58.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Perhaps it's a layer of secondary encryption.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:02.35,0:19:05.46,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The coordinates are forming an image.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:05.62,0:19:09.90,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Why would the final Iacon entry be different from the others?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:13.33,0:19:15.42,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe it's a picture of the relic.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:15.62,0:19:19.89,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Of what possible use could that be to us without knowing its location?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:20.34,0:19:23.23,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I trust that Alpha Trion has his reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.95,0:19:32.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Smokescreen?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.12,0:19:35.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Prime's latest recruit
Dialogue: 0,0:19:36.39,0:19:38.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,is the final relic of Iacon?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:40.07,0:19:41.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Is this that hotshot's idea of a joke?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.81,0:19:45.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe he knows where the key is.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:46.32,0:19:47.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And never bothered to mention it?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:48.03,0:19:49.72,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,A more likely possibility
Dialogue: 0,0:19:49.84,0:19:54.41,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,is that Smokescreen himself somehow is the key, without knowing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:54.92,0:19:57.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Whatever the case, he could be in grave danger.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.11,0:20:01.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Smokescreen, return to base immediately.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:05.36,0:20:07.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,He may have deactivated his comm link.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:08.15,0:20:11.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Locate his position and prepare the ground bridge.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:27.11,0:20:30.72,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It seems our side project is already paying off.
