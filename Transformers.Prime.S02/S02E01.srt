1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,860
不久之前 我们力挽狂澜
In hindsight, we accomplished what was required.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,670
由于宇宙大帝的苏醒
With Unicron's awakening

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,480
我们不得不采取非常手段
extreme measures needed to be taken.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,590
与宿敌并肩作战
Enemies became allies

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,120
向同伴托付重担
allies became confidants.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,130
最终 借助领导模块的力量
And, with the Matrix of Leadership

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,510
地球得以平安无事
the planet Earth was saved.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,280
但这却是以巨大的个人牺牲为代价…
Though at immeasurable personal cost...

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,020
在擎天柱失去领导模块的同时
When Optimus surrendered the Matrix

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,630
也失去了历代领袖所积累下来的智慧
he'd lost more than the collective wisdom of the Primes.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,590
他们是谁？
Who are they?

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,340
是我们的死敌！
Our mortal enemies!

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,770
…他遗忘了自我
... He lost himself.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,740
这解释不通啊
That doesn't follow.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,460
擎天柱依旧认识威震天！
Optimus knew Megatron!

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,100
而且好得就跟老相识一样！
They were like BFFs!

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,630
如果说擎天柱不记得自己的名字
If Optimus did not know his own name

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,730
也许是因为他当时还没有被选为领袖
perhaps it is because the title of Prime hasn't yet been granted to him.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,990
- 哈？\N- 什么？
- Huh?\N- What?

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,670
再说一遍？
Say again?

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,660
由于领导模块的力量不再护佑他
With the power of the Matrix no longer within him

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,490
理所当然的 他回到了成为领袖之前的状态：
it would stand to reason that Optimus has reverted to his pre-Prime state:

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,250
历史档案保管员 奥利安・派克斯
the historical archivist, Orion Pax.

24
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,140
你是说 他是这么认为的
You mean, in his mind.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
你是说他现在是个图书管理员\N而且是个霸天虎？！
Are you telling me Prime thinks he is some kind of librarian and a Decepticon?!

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,900
全体船员注意
Attention, crew.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,270
我们的贵客目前尚须独处
Our guest is currently in isolation

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,600
以适应新的环境
to help ease his transition.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,010
当你们见到奥利安・派克斯时
But when Orion Pax emerges

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,470
必须以礼相待
he is to be shown every courtesy.

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,680
如果有人胆敢称呼他“擎天柱” 那我会揪出他的扬声器
And the first to address him as "Optimus Prime" will have his voice-box torn out.

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,860
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,940
无论如何 任由一个前任汽车人在这里晃荡
Is it wise, to allow an Autobot, current or former

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,090
这明智吗？
full run of the premises?

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,160
这艘船上的任何风吹草动都逃不过我的眼睛
Nothing happens aboard this ship without my knowledge.

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,210
你最好牢记这一点 毒蜘蛛
You will do well to remember that, Airachnid.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,680
不过没什么好担心的
But there's no need for concern.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,070
奥利安并不像擎天柱那般骁勇善战
Orion does not possess the same fight Optimus is so renown for.

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,780
那他对我们有何用？
Then what use is he to our Cause?

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,920
啊 放心吧 奥利安会证明自己的价值的
Ah, rest assured, Orion Pax will indeed earn his stripes.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,090
欢迎回归胜利之师
Welcome back to the winning team.

42
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,250
是否成为霸天虎需要做出选择 福勒探员
Being a Decepticon is a choice, Agent Fowler.

43
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,280
我绝不相信擎天柱会在有生之年做出这样的决定
One that I have a hard time believing Optimus would make at any point in his life.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
所以 如果他和虎子们狼狈为奸…
So, if he's riding with the 'Cons...

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,160
…肯定是威震天给他灌了某种迷魂汤
... it's because Megatron is working some kind of voodoo.

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,170
奥利安・派克斯也许现在不知道自己是汽车人
Orion Pax may not currently be an Autobot up here

47
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,190
但我坚信在他的内心深处 绝不会放弃追逐理想
but I must believe, he will never stop being one in here.

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,790
我们必须找到他来确认这点
We must locate him to know for certain.

49
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,730
等等 山姆大叔在我背上装了块芯片
Hold up. I have a chip lodged in my behind that let's Uncle Sam know

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,120
以防止我开小差
when I stop for donuts.

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,960
难道你们就没办法追踪到擎天柱了？
Are you telling me you can't just track Prime?

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,490
擎天柱的信号自他进入地心后就再也没出现过
Optimus's signal has not reappeared since he embarked for Earth's core.

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,490
但我们必须全力去找他
But we must get to work finding him.

54
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,180
如此一来 我们还是有机会启用应急方案的
If we have any hope of initiating his contingency plan.

55
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,350
…应急方案？
Contingency plan?

56
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,170
什么应急方案？
What "contingency"?

57
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,620
那只是个词吗?
Is that even a word?

58
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,790
是钥匙芯片！
The Key card!

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,460
好吧 它是做什么用的？
So, what's it do?

60
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,640
用来启动魔力神球
It grants access to Vector Sigma

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,710
历代领袖的智慧宝库
the repository of the wisdom of the Primes.

62
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,230
那是一种超级计算机么？
Is that some sort of supercomputer?

63
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,520
那么 我们只要把擎天柱的记忆重新下载一遍就行了？
So, we can just download Optimus's memories back into him?

64
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,490
太棒了！这个大球在哪儿？
Great! Which one is the big V?

65
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,720
这个？还是后面哪个？
Over here? Somewhere in back?

66
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,400
魔力神球可不光是一个“超级计算机”杰克
Vector Sigma is more than a "supercomputer", Jack.

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,020
它是一种神秘力量的古老源泉
It is an ancient source of mystical power.

68
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,100
在塞博特恩上
On Cybertron.

69
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,440
汽车人俘虏了你 并让你一直处在休眠状态 奥利安
You had been a captive of the Autobots and locked in stasis for quite some time, Orion.

70
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,820
在这期间 我们已经流亡到了另一个世界
Long enough for us to be in exodus on another world.

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,680
流亡？为什么？
Exodus? Why?

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,240
都怪大军阀救护车的鲁莽行径
Because the Warlord Ratchet's careless actions

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,110
导致了这一切
led to this.

74
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,950
啊…
Ahhh...

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,880
…塞博特恩！
... Cybertron!

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,090
杰克逊・达比！不许你到外星球去！
Jackson Darby! You will NOT be travelling to another planet.

77
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,060
那我去！
I'm in!

78
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,780
你也不能去 神子
You're not going either, Miko.

79
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,970
你们谁都不许去
Not when one of YOU can.

80
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,200
琼是对的
June's right.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,590
为什么要派一个男孩去做一个汽车人的工作？
Why send a boy to do a bot's job?

82
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,180
因为只有领袖才能启动魔力神球
Because only a Prime can access Vector Sigma.

83
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,670
或者领袖钦点之人
Or one chosen by a Prime.

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,620
擎天柱把钥匙芯片交给了杰克
Optimus gave the Key card to Jack.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,450
它已经匹配了他独有的生命特征
It is now imprinted with his unique biosignature.

86
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,200
那么你的意思是 杰克算是名誉领袖了？
So, you mean Jack's like some kinda honorary Prime?

87
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,900
直说吧 要想让擎天柱变回那个我们熟知的汽车人 只有杰克能做到
Let's just say, Jack is the only one who can return Optimus to the Autobot we knew.

88
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,000
但为什么擎天柱故意置一个人类于险境？\N还是一个孩子？
But why would Optimus willfully endanger a human? A child?

89
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,680
我不是孩子了 妈妈！
I'm not a child, Mom!

90
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,690
也许擎天柱相信杰克大有潜力可挖？
Maybe Optimus believes there's more to Jack than meets the eye.

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,350
说这些都毫无意义
All of which is moot.

92
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,170
如果到不了塞博特恩 钥匙芯片对我们毫无用处
The Key-card is useless to us without the means of reaching Cybertron

93
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,170
而现在我们却是一筹莫展
which we at present do not possess.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,440
伙计 那个怎么样？
Dude. What about THAT?

95
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,380
神子 环陆桥只能勉强送他们到地球轨道 记得吗？
Miko, the Ground bridge barely got them into Earth orbit, remember?

96
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,270
是啊 但是救护车造了这个
Yeah, but Ratchet built it.

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
他就不能给这东西增强功率吗？
Can't he just turbo-charge the thing?

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,290
我不相信救护车会做出这么可怕的事情
I cannot believe Ratchet capable of such horrors.

99
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,110
是啊 难以想象 放任这个江湖郎中追求权力会是什么后果
Yes. And to think the Doctor of Doom's mad quest for power continues...

100
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,810
他的爪牙把我们驱逐至这个星球轨道上
his marauders pursued us to this planet's orbit.

101
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,920
我们认为这星球上的物种还没准备好接受我们
We feel its species are not ready to behold us.

102
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,550
但我们已下定决心保卫这个星球 以避免重蹈我们的覆辙
But we have resolved to protect this world from the same tragedy which was dealt to our own.

103
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,620
我有一个问题 威震天
One question, Megatron.

104
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,770
我们为什么被称作霸天虎？
Why are we called Decepticons?

105
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,780
不过是汽车人的恐慌伎俩而已
Another craven Autobot scare tactic.

106
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,920
用这个名字来妖魔化我们
The name was meant to demonize us.

107
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,040
相反 我们将它视为荣誉的象征
Instead, we wear it as a badge of honour.

108
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,890
若追求真理被视作霸权的话
For if speaking the truth is deception

109
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,270
那我们甘当此罪
then we are gladly guilty.

110
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,100
奥利安 别着急
Now please, Orion.

111
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,530
还有很多时间给你补课
There will be plenty of time for catching up.

112
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,110
你现在得休息
You must rest.

113
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,450
威震天！
Megatron!

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,370
我会竭尽全力阻止救护车那罄竹难书的侵略暴行
I will do my part to stop Ratchet's unspeakable crimes of aggression.

115
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,440
我以自己的火种起誓
This I vow. With all my Spark.

116
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,360
看来我们成功获取了奥利安火种的信任
It seems we have successfully achieved control of Orion's spark.

117
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,920
现在要让他的脑子为我所用了
Now, to put his mind to work.

118
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,930
你清理完数据核心了吗?
Have you sanitized the data-core?

119
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,630
很好 我们的新档案员可以随心所欲地浏览我们的文件了
Excellent. Our new archivist will require unlimited access to our files.

120
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,050
若让他不巧撞见敏感信息 恐怕会带来不良后果
It would be counterproductive for him to stumble upon any sensitive information.

121
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,830
两份“巨无霸汉堡”特色餐 请慢用！
Two "body slamburger" specials. Enjoy!

122
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,940
嘿 杰克！
Hey Jack!

123
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,380
赛拉！
Sierra!

124
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,320
怎么我最近一直没见到你？
How come I never see you around?

125
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,600
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,960
我们有化学反应的啊
We have chemistry together.

127
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,700
呃 化学课！我是指化学课
Ehm, "class"! Chemistry class.

128
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,980
我是说 课堂以外的时候
I mean, outside of school.

129
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,410
我从来没在聚会上或是商场里看过你
I never see you at any parties or the mall.

130
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,560
嗯 大部分时间我都带着帽子站在这里
Well, mostly I'm here, wearing the hat.

131
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,890
而且你也知道 准备变动指数考试得下相当的功夫
And you never can study too hard for the old SATs, you know.

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,370
而且 我还有些别的…事情
And, there's some other... stuff.

133
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,260
噢！先别走！
Oh. Don't go anywhere!

134
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,180
KO汽车快餐欢迎您 请问您要点…
Welcome to K.O. drive-in, may I take your...

135
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,270
五点了 杰克 你该下班了
5 PM, Jack. Your shift is over.

136
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,010
我们该走了
Let's go.

137
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,110
哦！原来是“这事”
Oh! That kind of... "stuff".

138
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,160
赛拉！等等！
Sierra, wait!

139
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,890
…她是我妈妈！
She's my mother!

140
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,200
你妈穿皮衣真有型
Your mom looks good in leather.

141
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,040
还骑在你的摩托上
On your bike.

142
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,160
我不是故意要毁了你的社交生活的
Didn't mean to decimate your social life.

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,690
又不是第一次了
Not the first time.

144
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,930
有擎天柱的消息了吗？
Any sign of Optimus?

145
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,270
暂时没有
Not today.

146
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,530
只是暂时的！
Not yet!

147
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,740
当我们在塞博特恩内战中取得优势之时 我们占领了铁堡的档案馆
When we stormed the Iacon Hall of Records in the winning days of the war for Cybertron

148
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,250
从那里得到了一些高度机密文件
we acquired highly classified files.

149
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,350
这些文件被汽车人加密过了 我们无法破译
Files written with Autobot codes, which we had been unable to decipher.

150
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:01,050
汽车人的密文 对铁堡档案员奥利安・派克斯而言那是手到擒来啊
Autobot codes, which the Iacon archivist Orion Pax should have no trouble cracking.

151
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,580
考虑到潜在的风险
Considering what's at stake

152
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,500
我们是不是该加强这附近的安保？
shouldn't we beef up the security around here?

153
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,920
击倒 我倒认为奥利安需要一个完全不受威胁或拘束的环境
Knockout, I believe that Orion will perform most effectively

154
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,990
才会有效地完成他的工作
if he does not feel threatened or confined in any way.

155
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:24,980
当然 奥利安的工作室靠近能量储藏室绝非偶然
However, it is no coincidence that Orion's work-station is located in direct proximity to the Energon storage vault.

156
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,760
因为能量储藏室随时有人监管…
Which is under constant surveillance...

157
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,310
…陛下英明
Well played.

158
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,370
救护车！你在增强环陆桥的功率吗？
Ratchet! Are you turbo-charging the Ground-bridge?

159
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,180
只是随便弄弄
Tinkering.

160
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,710
不必抱太大期望
No need to get anyone's hopes up, just yet.

161
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,390
奥利安！“铁堡”计划进展得如何了？
Orion! How fares project "Iacon"?

162
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,860
恐怕我的技艺生疏了
I am a bit rusty, I fear.

163
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,330
我只破译了三个条目
I've only managed to decode three entries.

164
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,100
都是些什么内容？
And what do these entries comprise?

165
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,510
这些都是我在休眠期间的档案
They were logged by Autobot archivist during the war after I entered stasis.

166
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,440
我唯一了解的信息是
My only knowledge of its content so far

167
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,580
它们是坐标
is that they are coordinates

168
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,660
目标地点正是这个星球
targeting locations on this very planet.

169
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,700
我猜测 这些地方可能藏有塞博特恩的飞船
I surmise that they could indicate hiding places for vessels

170
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,730
用于保管某些东西
shuttled from Cybertron for safe-keeping.

171
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,410
比如历史文件或者艺术品？
Such as historical documents or cultural artifacts?

172
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,650
我更担心他们藏匿了大规模杀伤性武器
My greatest fear would be weapons of mass destruction.

173
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,330
以便不时之需
Hidden away for later use.

174
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,220
那更说明我们得竭尽全力
All the more reason it is essential that we do everything in our power

175
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,210
阻止汽车人得到这些飞船
to keep said vessels from Autobot reach.

176
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,070
能有你相助是我们的造化 奥利安・派克斯
We are fortunate to have you on our side, Orion Pax.

177
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,890
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

178
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,910
有一个信息令我很困惑
I am puzzled by one particular finding.

179
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,730
很多历史资料中提及您的副官红蜘蛛
I have discovered several historic references to Starscream as your second-in-command.

180
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,820
但我却没在船上看到他
Yet I have not seen him aboard the ship.

181
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,310
很不幸 红蜘蛛指挥官已经牺牲了
Sadly, Commander Starscream is dead.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,390
奥利安的问题太多了
Orion asks many questions.

183
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,120
对一个档案员来说这是好品质 但作为霸天虎则不然
A valuable trait in an archivist, but not in a Decepticon.

184
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,590
要不了多久 他就会识破我们的骗局
It is a matter of time before he unravels our fabrications

185
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,910
并重拾他与生俱来的是非观念…
and his innate sense of right and wrong rises to the surface...

186
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,940
我只希望奥利安能完成“铁堡”计划
I only hope that Orion will complete project "Iacon"

187
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,640
在我干净彻底地 销毁他之前
before I am forced to destroy him, once and for all.

188
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,090
救护车！
Ratchet!

189
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
你醒了吗？
You awake?

190
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,660
紧急情况！
This is an emergency!

191
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,240
福勒探员！是擎天柱吗？
Agent Fowler! Is it Optimus?

192
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,490
是虎子！
It's 'Cons!

193
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,730
他们又闯进了两个月前他们袭击过的军用实验室
And they're busting into the same military research lab they hit two months ago.

194
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
又想建太空桥了？
Another Space-bridge?

195
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,740
最重要的是擎天柱和他们在一起
But for all we know Optimus is riding with them.

196
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,140
出发！
Roll out!

197
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,230
放下动力装置！
Drop the power source!

198
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,520
你们是不是缺个人？
Aren't you missing someone?

199
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,910
把桥准备好！
Ready for that bridge!

200
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,340
我们一定代你们向柱子问好
We'll be sure to tell the big O you said "Hello".

201
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,340
阿尔茜！
Arcee!

202
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,180
见鬼
Scrap.

203
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,200
擎天柱在哪儿？
Where's Optimus?

204
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,680
回答我！
Answer me!

205
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,570
什么？！
What?!

206
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,560
阿尔茜…
Arcee...

207
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,130
让我来好好招待她
Allow me to welcome her aboard.

208
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,370
不！别说当着奥利安的面摧毁一个汽车人
No! If Orion so much as lays eyes on another Autobot

209
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,350
哪怕让他看到别的汽车人
let alone be allowed to witness its destruction

210
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,270
都会让他对之前相信的事情产生怀疑
everything he currently believes will be called into question.

211
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,070
立即确保阿尔茜被护送着离开这艘船！
See to it that Arcee is escorted off this ship immediately!

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
奥利安！请回到你的工作站
Orion! Please return to your station.

213
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,090
这是威震天陛下的命令
Lord Megatron's orders.

214
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,800
我听到了骚动声
I heard a commotion.

215
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,870
什么？
What the...?

216
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,230
你既没确定霸天虎的位置
You weren't able to determine the Decepticons' location

217
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,330
也不确定擎天柱是否在船上？
or if Optimus was even aboard ship?

218
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,080
我…不能确认
I... can't confirm.

219
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,230
隔板！
Bulkhead!

220
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,970
干嘛！？那个你有用吗？
What? You needed that?

221
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,480
我唯一需要的就是我们的头头回来！
Only thing I need is our head honcho back!

222
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,890
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

223
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,090
要是有人真心想救擎天柱 肯定会有办法
If any of us needed rescuing, Optimus would have found a way.

224
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,160
我没找到 就那么简单
I didn't. Simple as that.

225
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,140
救护车！
Ratchet!

226
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,040
你们都做了什么？
What happened out there?

227
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,170
我接到报告说十多人受伤了
Reports indicate at least a dozen wounded.

228
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,130
这让我怎么去解释
The hit's on me to provide some explanation.

229
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,820
你们干脆都回家去
You bots better get your act together or the Pentagon

230
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,590
要不五角大楼会让我封了你们的基地
will make me shut down your base.

231
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,350
那你们能去哪儿？
But... where would you go?

232
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,860
谁知道 也许他们会把我们用船运到某个岛上
Who knows. Maybe they'll ship us out to some island

233
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,640
或者是把我们送上太空！
or fire us into space!

234
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
我们倒乐得轻松
Wouldn't that be a welcome relief.

235
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,860
我不怪福勒！
I don't blame Fowler!

236
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,980
要是擎天柱在 他会在与虎子交战之前
Optimus would have evacuated all humans in the area

237
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,760
疏散那片区域的所有人类
before engaging the 'Cons.

238
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,560
实际上我们才不知道擎天柱会怎么做 因为他根本就不在这！
We don't actually know what Optimus would have done because he's not here!

239
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,140
你真会说废话 小隔
You're pretty good at stating the obvious, Bulk.

240
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,450
能讲点我们不知道的吗？
Anything else you'd like to mention that we already know?

241
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,050
在孩子们面前我没什么可说的
Nothing I can say in front of the children.

242
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,600
嘿！我们就不能看看积极的一面吗？
Hey! Aren't we overlooking one positive?

243
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,710
没人注意到虎子们接下来要做什么吗？
Nobody's talking about what the 'Cons just got their claws on.

244
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,790
是啊 他们终于如愿以偿
Yes, we managed to allow them to finally

245
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,690
得到了太空桥的动力装置！
acquire a power source for their space bridge!

246
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,740
那怎么能算积极的方面？
And how exactly that would be a positive?

247
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,950
我们让他们造好太空桥
We let them finish building their Space-bridge.

248
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,580
为什么？好让他们把更多的僵尸\N从塞博特恩带到这里来吗？
Why? So they can bring more zombies back from Cybertron?

249
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,310
不 好让我们去接管它
No. So we can commandeer it.

250
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,910
用它把我送到塞博特恩去
And use it to send me to Cybertron.

251
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,830
哇哦 那真是个好主意
Woah. That's a pretty good idea.

252
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,970
噢 好吧
Oh well.

253
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,560
如果神子觉得那是个好主意…
If Miko thinks it's a good idea...

254
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,870
没人把它当成儿戏 但你们以前曾经夺取过太空桥！
Nobody saying it will be easy but you've seized the Space-bridge before!

255
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,580
我们只是炸飞了一个
We blew one up.

256
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,560
那跟夺取并控制一个是两码事
That's a whole lot different than seizing and holding one.

257
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,920
小蜂是对的 我们先得找到那玩意
Bee's right. We have to find that thing first.

258
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,730
我说！
Hellooo!

259
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,170
要是太空桥的话 难道不应该在…？
If it's a space bridge... isn't it?

260
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,270
“太空”指的是传送范围
The term "space" refers to its transport range

261
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,390
不是它本身的地理位置
not its physical location.

262
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,130
上次事件以后我们就一直在监控地球轨道
And we've been monitoring Earth's orbit since the last one

263
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,750
要是有太空桥的话我们会知道的
we'd know if it were there.

264
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,490
那么太空桥可能就在地球上的某处？
So, the Bridge could be somewhere right here on Earth?

265
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,610
这相当于在一个废车场里找一个涡轮机
Like trying to find a servo at a scrapyard.

266
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,260
那我们最好现在就行动
Then maybe we better start looking.

267
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,970
但现状没有改变：
But the fact remains:

268
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,730
我们不知道霸天虎要对擎天柱做什么
We don't know what the Decepticons have in store for Optimus.

269
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,430
也不知道他是否还健在
Or if he's truly safe from harm.

270
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,520
红蜘蛛！
Starscream!

271
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,840
是“红蜘蛛指挥官”
That's "Commander Starscream".

272
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,320
你们短路了吗？
What's your malfunction?

273
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,750
立刻放下武器
Lower those weapons immediately.

274
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,960
对不起 长官 但是威震天陛下有令 如果你回到船上
I'm sorry, Sir, but Lord Megatron ordered that you be taken into custody

275
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,440
就立即将你逮捕
should you ever return to the ship.

276
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,130
什么？
What?

277
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,080
显然 这中间有些差错
Clearly, there has been a mistake.

278
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,870
看呐！
Lo!

279
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,320
擎天柱？！
Optimus Prime?!
