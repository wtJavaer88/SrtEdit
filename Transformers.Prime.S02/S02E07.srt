1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,150
恕我直言 威震天陛下
If it pleases you, Lord Megatron

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,180
现在声波在破译剩余的铁堡密码
once Soundwave discovers a means of decoding the remainder of the Iacon database

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,090
我们知道他定能手到擒来
-- as we know he will, I would suggest the deployment of an underutilized asset.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,090
同时我提醒您还有一种资源未被充分利用
-- as we know he will, I would suggest the deployment of an underutilized asset.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,210
什么资源 毒蜘蛛？
And what asset would that be, Airachnid?

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,180
我相信我卓越的侦查技能
I believe that my superior tracking skills would expedite

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,960
可以加快您寻找其余遗物的步伐
your quest to recover the remaining relics.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,810
我知道了
Noted.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,060
英明的决断 我的陛下
You are a gracious audience, My Lord.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,070
声波
Soundwave.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,030
我该信任她吗？
Remind me of her trustworthiness.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,160
“我们必须做出长远的打算 无需考虑威震天了”
"I believe we must consider the possibility of a future... without Megatron."

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,940
骇翼
Dreadwing.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,740
随时听从您的吩咐 威震天陛下
I am at your beck and call, Lord Megatron.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,780
我要交给你一个本该由我亲自督办的任务
I wish to entrust you with a task I would normally reserve for myself.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,380
这也是证明你能胜任副官的最好机会
That is, if you wish to prove yourself worthy of becoming my first lieutenant.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
这个职位目前属于毒蜘蛛
That post belongs to Airachnid.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,800
我们会怀念她的
She will be missed.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,860
我建议你最好带上后援 她可相当棘手
And I suggest you bring backup. She can be a handful.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,690
特别是被逼入绝境的时候…
Especially when cornered...

21
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,750
难道只有我认为威震天在小题大作吗？
Am I the only one here who considers this to be overkill on Lord Megatron's part?

22
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,280
我是说 他居然派遣两个得力部下
I mean, dispatching two of his most proficient warriors

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,070
去勘探一个未经开采的能量矿
to track down one unconfirmed Energon spike.

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,010
威震天认为我和骇翼就足以完成任务
Megatron knows me and Dreadwing here will get the job done.

25
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,670
事实上 我说的得力部下是我和骇翼
Actually, I was referring to Dreadwing and myself.

26
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,980
呃…
Eghh...

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,550
打击 专注你的任务
Breakdown, remain on task.

28
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,490
我们必须齐心协力
This must be a unified effort.

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,910
没错 打击
Indeed, Breakdown.

30
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,000
我知道你一只眼看不惯我一双眼
I know we've never seen eyes to eye

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,420
不过你还有补丁嘛
but that doesn't mean we can't patch things up.

32
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,520
呃 受够了！
That's it!

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
别这样！
Don't!

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,790
打击！别干傻事 先救我出来！
Breakdown, don't be a fool. Release me.

35
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,040
哈哈哈
Hahahahaha...

36
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,880
小菜一碟…
Easy prey.

37
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,490
打击 你怎么样了？打击!
Breakdown, what is your status? Breakdown!

38
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,640
机械党一号报告塞拉斯 我们有了意外的发现
MECH 1 to Silas. Our maneuvers have yielded unexpected results...

39
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,090
还是个老相识…
and a familiar face.

40
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,600
我居然沦落到靠捡能量碎片来度日？
How is it that I have been reduced to seeking Energon scraps merely to survive?

41
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,030
机器昆虫？在地球上！
An Insecticon, on Earth?

42
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,610
嘿 你个捡垃圾的！
You there, scavenger!

43
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,440
把那块能量给我
Deliver that Energon to me.

44
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,180
你胆敢对你的上司如此不敬？
You dare turn your back on a superior life-form?

45
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,830
我是红蜘蛛指挥官！
I am commander Starscream.

46
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,900
好吧！留着那块能量吧！
Fine! Keep the Energon.

47
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,990
希望它噎死你！
I hope you choke on it.

48
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,500
很好 奴隶 到我这儿来
Yes, minion, approach me.

49
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,500
服从我
Obey me.

50
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,900
朝拜我
Worship me.

51
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,750
不用这么客气
You shouldn't have.

52
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,250
什么？你拒绝了一个指挥官
What?! You reject a commander

53
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,160
却对那种小人物奴颜婢膝？
but grovel at the feet of that wretch?

54
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,860
红蜘蛛 别愁眉苦脸的
Starscream. Don't get your turbines in a twist.

55
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,030
毕竟 这个怪兽和我有些亲缘关系
After all, the beast and I are somewhat related.

56
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,820
甚至可以说 我们是心灵相通的
You might even say we are of... one mind.

57
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,690
你为什么会在这儿？
Why are you here?

58
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,930
霸天虎从来不会回到开采完毕的矿区！
Decepticons never return to stripped mines.

59
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,000
你并非唯一一个回来找能量的流亡霸天虎
You are not the only rogue Decepticon in need of Energon.

60
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,110
那是和汽车人战斗受的伤？
Was it a run-in with the Autobots?

61
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,190
还是威震天又邀请你参加他的“实地考察”了？
Or did Megatron invite you on one of his field trips?

62
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,400
威震天在忙别的事
Megatron was otherwise engaged.

63
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,220
不过你可以见到他的新仆人
But you should see his lackey.

64
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,660
你看 毒蜘蛛
You know, Airachnid

65
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:46,900
我们同为流亡者 应先将分歧放在一边
as fellow outcasts, we should consider putting aside our differences.

66
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,820
我们有了这种听从你指挥的生物
With this creature under your control

67
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,130
我们可以用他去了结威震天
... and at our disposal, we might employ it to terminate Megatron

68
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,150
夺取霸天虎的控制权
allowing us to rule the Decepticons.

69
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,500
一起？
Together?

70
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,890
我们只需要将威震天引到这儿
We would simply need to lure Megatron here

71
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,040
让他远离他的“支援系统”
away from his support systems

72
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,130
这样我们也许能逮到他…
so that we might catch him...

73
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,760
趁他放松警惕之时？
With his guard down?

74
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,990
一个迷人的计划
An intriguing proposal...

75
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,900
不过我并不希望与你共同统治霸天虎
If ruling Decepticons or spending any length of time with you

76
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,050
甚至是与你相处…
were of the slightest interest to me.

77
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,110
什么？啊！
That... agh? huh!

78
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,890
当然 你给了我一个打败威震天的机会
Of course, you had me at "terminate Megatron."

79
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,140
复仇会是甜蜜的…
Payback would be sweet.

80
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,520
总之你说了算
However you wish to spin it.

81
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,610
我需要确认我的刺客能胜任这份差事
I would need to ensure my assassin is up to the task.

82
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,520
也许需要一个测试…
Perhaps a test run is in order.

83
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,210
什么？我以为我们是同伴！
What? I thought we were partners.

84
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,340
剖开他！
Eviscerate him.

85
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,500
这是什么？
What is it?

86
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,690
一个含有嵌入信息的高频信号
A high-frequency signal with an embedded message.

87
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,310
又是他？
Again?

88
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,250
红蜘蛛 我有你最感兴趣的情报
Starscream. "I have obtained information of extreme interest to you."

89
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,990
带医疗箱过来
"Bring medical kit."

90
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,590
安全！
Clear!

91
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,870
快说！
Make it fast.

92
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,260
毒蜘蛛也成了像我一样的流亡霸天虎
It would appear that, like myself, Airachnid has gone rogue.

93
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,900
这对我们有什么用？！
What's it to us?

94
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,930
她计划报复威…
She is planning to retaliate against Meg...

95
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,050
…人类！
Eh... mankind.

96
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,630
我可以向你提供她目前的位置
I can provide you with her current location.

97
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,900
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

98
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,510
为什么？
Why wouldn't you?

99
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,210
我曾经告诉你霸天虎太空桥的位置
I directed you to the location of the decepticon space bridge

100
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,260
你才救回了奥利安・派克斯 对吧？
so you could rescue Orion Pax, didn't I?

101
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,700
是的 但随后你就帮机械党偷走了大黄蜂的变形齿轮
Yeah, but then you helped M.E.C.H. steal Bumblebee's T-cog.

102
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,980
是吗？但他又抢了回去 不是吗？
So? He got it back, didn't he?

103
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,810
我承认！与邪恶的人类合作
I admit... aligning myself with those vile humans

104
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,420
是个巨大的错误
was a colossal error in judgment.

105
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,150
但我孤立无援！我做的一切都是为了生存！
But I am alone. I do what I must to survive.

106
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,570
而且我为此付出了代价
But I have paid the price.

107
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,890
现在我失去了自己的变形齿轮！
I am now the one missing his T-cog.

108
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,810
你飞不起来了？
You're grounded?

109
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,080
所以对你们来说毫无威胁
Thus of little, if any, threat to you.

110
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
但是 毒蜘蛛和她的机器昆虫打算…
But Airachnid and her Insecticon intend to...

111
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,520
机器昆虫？！在这里？
An Insecticon?! Here?

112
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,510
怎么会？！
How?

113
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,180
本来我也想问个明白…
Well, I would have asked.

114
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,100
…但当时我急于从一个小缝隙里面挤过去
but I was too busy squeezing through a narrow crevice

115
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,200
以防止那只毒虫啃掉我的腿！
trying to keep the vermin from chewing my leg off!

116
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,760
而毒蜘蛛就在一旁看着…
While Airachnid watched.

117
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,760
我们已经搞清了为什么无法定位打击的信号
The reason for our inability to locate Breakdown's signal is all too clear.

118
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,660
但为何你连他的残骸都没能带回来？
But how is it that you were unable to recover his remains?

119
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,290
那是什么？
What is it?

120
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
想听听打击的最新消息吗？
Heard from Breakdown lately?

121
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,830
追踪信号
Trace the communication.

122
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,320
亲爱的威震天
Megatron, truly.

123
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,850
你居然派一个白痴喽罗 妄图消灭一个高级军官
You sent simple henchman to terminate a high-ranking officer.

124
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,280
我本以为你只会把这份殊荣留给自己…
I thought you reserved that honor for yourself.

125
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
这是个挑衅！
Is that a challenge?

126
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,660
一个邀请
An invitation.

127
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,360
毫无疑问 既然声波正在追踪这个信号
And since Soundwave is no doubt tracing this signal

128
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,650
那你知道在哪里能找到我…
you know where to find me.

129
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,350
我去去就来
I'll be back.

130
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,700
请允许我伴您同去
Allow me to accompany you.

131
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,720
我已经给过你机会了
You already had your chance.

132
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,510
红蜘蛛提供的坐标位于一座废弃的霸天虎矿区
The coordinates Starscream provided are within an abandoned Decepticon mine.

133
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,780
等等 你刚刚修好他 就打发他走了？
Hold on. You just fixed him up and sent him on his way?

134
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,130
不然你想怎么样
What were we supposed to do?

135
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,550
带他回来？
Take him back here?

136
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,630
我不会放弃任何一个追杀毒蜘蛛的机会
Not that I wouldn't jump at any chance to put Airachnid down

137
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,540
但她并非唯一一个杀害我搭档的人
but she isn't the only one who's robbed me of a partner.

138
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,230
当时你不在场 阿尔茜
You weren't there, Arcee.

139
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,600
红蜘蛛虚弱至极 毫无抵抗能力
Starscream was weak, defenseless.

140
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,460
此外机器昆虫的情报具有战略价值
And learning of the Insecticon could prove highly tactical.

141
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,750
根据以往的经验 红蜘蛛的情报是可靠的
Starscream's intel has proved credible in the past.

142
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,480
没错！在他不忙于暗算我们的时候
Sure, when he wasn't busy stabbing us in the back.

143
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,120
眼下我们缺少塞博特恩上的资源
Without the resources we possessed on Cybertron

144
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,560
用来监禁和束缚敌人
we lack ready means of capturing and imprisoning our enemies.

145
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,480
尽管如此 我仍然不能漠视无助的生命
Nonetheless, I do not condone the termination of any defenseless life-form.

146
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,800
您一向雷厉风行
You don't waste time.

147
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,850
你的缓刑期已经到头了！
Your stay of execution has come to an end.

148
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,260
我介绍你们俩认识一下
I will leave you two to get acquainted.

149
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,710
向威震天 你们的主人 鞠躬！
Bow before Megatron, your leader.

150
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,130
我说 鞠躬！
I said, "bow..."

151
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,460
你和你的畜牲给我记住了
You and your beast would do well to remember...

152
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,040
我可是在卡隆的角斗场里杀出来的！
I honed my skills in the pits of Kaon!

153
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,670
谨慎行事
Proceed with extreme caution.

154
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,280
结果他！
Finish him!

155
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,970
喔 小红可没提到威震天！
Whoa. Scream never mentioned Megatron.

156
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,680
看上去是红蜘蛛精心策划了这一幕
It would seem Starscream orchestrated this convergence

157
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,960
设计让他的敌人自相残杀 好坐收渔翁之利
in the hope that all his enemies would destroy each other on his behalf.

158
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,470
我中计了！
And I fell for it.

159
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,690
你可以随意处置威震天的遗骸 毒蜘蛛是我的
Well, you can have whatever's left of Megatron. Airachnid's mine.

160
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,980
阿尔茜 不！
Arcee! No!

161
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,340
你！
You.

162
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,270
今天真是惊喜连连！
So many surprises, today.

163
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,860
这是一个警告 给所有妄图挑衅卡隆角斗士的人！
Let that be a warning to anyone who dares cross a gladiator of Kaon

164
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,530
无论是霸天虎或是汽车人
be they Decepticon...  or Autobot.

165
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,620
我已经无力反抗了 全凭你处置
It would seem that I'm unarmed and at your mercy.

166
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,610
请告诉我擎天柱 你会放我一马吗？
So, tell me, Optimus. Do you intend to take me alive?

167
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,560
或是就此了结恩怨
Or end this here and now?

168
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,890
惊喜总是不断
The surprises never cease.

169
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,580
哦 糟了…
Oh, scrap.

170
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,170
不好!
Scrap!

171
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,580
或许今天我无法熄灭威震天的火种
This may not be the day that I take Megatron's spike

172
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,480
但我可以结果了你…
but it is the day I remove yours.

173
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,100
你说的很对 毒蜘蛛
How right you were, Airachnid.

174
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,900
复仇会是甜蜜的
Payback is sweet.

175
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,950
把威震天交给我们
Deliver Megatron to us

176
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,980
我们会让你们全身而退
and I will allow you to live.

177
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,990
永远不要相信虎子 打爆这个铁桶头！
Never trust a Con. Kick buckethead's bucket!

178
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,830
骇翼 我能信任你吗？
Dreadwing, do I have your word?

179
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,600
我的君王
My liege.

180
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,110
骇翼 也许你会遵守诺言 可我不会
Dreadwing may have given you his word, but I did not.

181
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,940
消灭他们！
Destroy them!

182
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,640
你们胆敢抗命追踪我到此
You disobeyed my orders in following me here.

183
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,260
你会是一个好副官的
You will make a fine first lieutenant.

184
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,500
这可真够刺激的
That was intense.

185
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,920
如果说除了八条腿的我还讨厌什么
Now, if there's one thing I despise nearly as much as eight-leggers

186
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,920
那就是两轮车…
it's two-wheelers.

187
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,170
来吧 动手吧
Go on. Get it over with.

188
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,080
我想起来了 这一幕似曾相识
As I recollect, in a similar predicament.

189
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,760
你留了我一命
you once allowed me to live.

190
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,520
现在我们扯平了
Consider us even.

191
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,340
阿尔茜 你情况如何？
Arcee, what is your status?

192
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,200
还活着 但需要帮助
In need of assist, but alive.

193
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,150
估计毒蜘蛛也一样
And so is Airachnid.

194
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,500
至少威震天除掉了她的害虫
At least Megatron took care of the other bug problem.

195
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,420
红蜘蛛 我发誓要拧下你的脑袋！
Starscream, I vow I will have your head.

196
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,070
原来我的“战士”不过是个前哨！
So, my warrior was merely a scout.
