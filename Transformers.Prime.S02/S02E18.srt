1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,750
删除大黄蜂 再替换上…
Removing Bumblebee and replacing him with...

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,540
踢踏舞猴子再度登场！
The tap-dancing monkey strikes again.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,030
大黄蜂在互联网上抛头露面不是什么好笑的事
Bumblebee sightings on the world wide web are no laughing matter.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,430
7 8 9…
7... 8... 9...

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,310
我就不能只开车吗？
Why can't I just drive from now on?

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,330
要是不用你的腿 它们会萎缩的
Because your legs will atrophy if you choose not to use them.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,740
噢…
Oh...

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,990
1 2 3…
1... 2... 3...

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,510
等等 那是什么？
Wait. What's that?

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,670
塞博特恩的逃生舱？
A Cybertronian escape pod?

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,430
在地球大气层里？
Here in Earth's atmosphere?

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,550
汽车人还是霸天虎？
Autobot or Decepticon?

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,790
图片很模糊 没法辨认
Impossible to tell, given the image resolution.

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,220
不管哪种情况我们都应调查一番
In any event, this merits investigation.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,140
没准是个圈套 此外我们还倒下一位
Could be a trap, and we're down one bot.

16
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,320
需要联系千斤顶吗？
Should we reach out to Wheeljack?

17
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,140
我听到了…
I can hear you!

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,310
我不管隔板是否能参加战斗
I don't care if Bulkhead isn't combat-ready.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,100
鉴于上次千斤顶和神子一手导演的复仇大戏 他还是去当世外高人吧
After that revenge stunt he pulled with Miko, Wheeljack can stay rogue.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,000
可能是一个遇难的汽车人
An Autobot may be in distress.

21
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,590
救护车 带上你的医疗箱
Ratchet, bring your medical kit.

22
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,410
是霸天虎那边的
It is of Decepticon origin.

23
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,290
里面的虎子已经跑路了
And the Con inside blew his way out.

24
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,580
那些虎子都是从一个舱里生出来的？
All those Cons came out of one pod?

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,450
按人类的说法 这是“英雄妈妈”
The humans refer to the phenomenon as a clown car.

26
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,470
有人过来了！
Incoming!

27
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,620
前面的趴下！
Down in front!

28
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,890
自己人？
Friendly?

29
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,340
后退！
Fall back!

30
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,080
哇噢 烫不烫 虎子们？
Whoo! Too hot for you, Cons?!

31
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,020
你的朋友？
Friend of yours?

32
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,050
从没见过他
Never seen him before.

33
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,790
点燃泄漏的能量
Torching that Energon leak.

34
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,320
我的点子不错吧？
Pretty good plan, right?

35
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,240
只不过那不是你的点子
Except that it wasn't your plan.

36
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,050
那不过是流弹造成的 而且差点连我们也一起烤糊了
It was a random shot that almost fried us to a crisp.

37
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,840
它管用了 不是吗？
Worked out, didn't it?

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,170
谢谢你 汽车人同伴
Thank you, fellow Autobot.

39
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,620
你的…勇气值得嘉奖
Your... valor... is to be commended.

40
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,050
我…难以置信！
I... don't believe it.

41
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,550
你是擎天柱！他是擎天柱！
Y-You're Optimus Prime! He's Optimus Prime!

42
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,980
- 我们知道\N- 是啊是的
- We know.\N- Yes, yes... yes.

43
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,000
你叫什么名字 战士？
What is your name, soldier?

44
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,940
烟幕 长官！
Smokescreen, sir.

45
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,970
欢迎来到地球 烟幕！
Welcome to Earth, Smokescreen.

46
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,100
来到这里是我的荣幸
It's an honor to be here...

47
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,470
尤其是能与您并肩战斗
Especially with you.

48
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,810
现在呢？我们不可能就这么带他回基地
Now what? It's not like we can just bring him back to base.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,850
我们有过被间谍“鱼目混珠”的先例
Wouldn't be the first time an ally turned out to be a plant.

50
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,470
看起来你在塞博特恩的精英卫队中接受过训练
I see that you received your training from Cybertron's Elite Guard.

51
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,250
没错 不过那儿和新兵训练营差不多
True enough... though it wasn't more than a boot camp by the time I joined.

52
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,880
连个像样的毕业典礼都没有
I never even got a proper graduation ceremony.

53
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,870
那是在战争时期！
There was a war going on.

54
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,790
嘿 我不过是想成为一名战士
Hey, all I ever wanted was to be a soldier

55
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,360
为汽车人事业而献身
serve the Autobot cause.

56
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,820
不过我最终却成为了一名铁堡的保安特遣队员！
But what I got was security detail at Iacon.

57
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,460
中央档案馆？
The Hall of Records of all places?

58
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,610
擎天柱 你不觉得这很可疑吗？
Optimus, do you not find this highly suspicious?

59
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,200
烟幕 你在档案馆的任务是什么？
Smokescreen, what was your assignment inside the hall?

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,880
当战争进入末期时负责护卫钛师傅
Guarding Alpha Trion during what turned out to be the final days of the war.

61
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,170
你直属于主档案保管员？
You served under the master archivist?

62
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,910
刚开始我很不开心
Eh, I wasn't thrilled at first...

63
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,520
不能去痛扁虎子 却要看着一个老头的背影
watching the back of an old bot instead of kicking Con tailpipe.

64
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,410
对不起 不过钛师傅真的是个良师…益友
Sorry. But the big "A" turned out to be a great teacher and a... true friend.

65
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,810
我是说 就是他在最高议会面前推举你为领袖的
I mean, he was the one who petitioned Halogen and the High Council to make you a Prime.

66
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,830
拉斐尔 启动环陆桥
Rafael... activate the ground bridge.

67
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,060
这就行了？
That's it?

68
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,860
就凭这几句话你就让他入伙了？
That's all you need to hear before inviting him to the party?

69
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,070
既然我的导师愿意与他分享这些信息
If my former mentor shared this information

70
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,660
就足以证明烟幕是可以信赖的伙伴
it is because he considered Smokescreen a trusted ally.

71
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,520
在千斤顶之后我们就再也没有新人入伙了！
We haven't had somebody new here since Wheeljack.

72
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,630
你的故事 烟幕？
What's your story, Smoke?

73
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,310
你从哪里来？怎么到这儿的？
Where'd you come from? How'd you get here?

74
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,990
你带了多少武器？
How many blasters you packin'?

75
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,930
这些就是我们要保护的生物？
So, these are the life-force we're supposed to protect?

76
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,820
他们都是这个样子的？
Are they all like this?

77
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,330
幸运的是并非如此
Fortunately not...

78
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:52,090
不过我和神子一样好奇你是怎么来到地球的？
but I too share Miko's fascination with how you came to arrive on Earth.

79
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,510
搭一艘霸天虎的逃生舱
In a Decepticon escape pod.

80
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,240
还是不信任我是吧？真难相处
Still got trust issues, huh? Tough crowd.

81
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,130
主战斗地点离档案馆至少有20公里
The main thrust of combat operations was at least 20 clicks from the Hall of Records

82
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,630
所以那里一度很平静
so things had been pretty quiet.

83
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,240
然而局势很快便急转直下
But the situation went downhill fast.

84
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,000
虎子们发动了一次大规模攻击\N击溃了铁堡外部的最后防线
The Cons launched a massive surge that wiped out the last line of defenses surrounding Iacon.

85
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,550
我是最后一个可以进行抵抗的人
I was the only thing left to them back

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,020
我得说 我尽力了！
and, let me tell you, I was pumped.

87
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,140
我是说 这是我第一次有机会参见真正的战斗！
I mean, this was my chance to see real action for the first time...

88
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,720
来证明我自己
to prove myself.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,300
直到我失去了意识
Until everything went black.

90
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,700
虎子们俘获了我 并将我绑到一艘运输船上
Cons took me prisoner and dumped me onto a transport ship.

91
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,410
不过我趁守卫不备钻进了一个逃生舱
But I managed to give a guard the slip and hopped in an escape pod.

92
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,590
很显然这是一个长距离逃生舱 它令我进入了休眠状态
Apparently, it was a long-distance pod, 'cause it knocked me into stasis.

93
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,210
等到我再次醒来的时候 正好重重摔落在地上
Next thing I knew, I'm hitting solid ground... hard.

94
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,810
霸天虎的战舰一定识别了逃生舱的信号\N并引导它来到了地球！
The Decepticon warship must have picked up pod's beacon and guided it to Earth.

95
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,820
这就解释了虎子们为什么会来迎接烟幕
Which would explain Smokescreen's welcoming committee.

96
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,850
那些虎子发现里面不是他们的同伙一定很失望
Bet those Cons were disappointed not to find one of their own inside.

97
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,440
烟幕 你知道在铁堡失守后
Smokescreen, do you know of Alpha Ttrion's fate

98
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,710
钛师傅怎么样了吗？
after the fall of Iacon?

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,110
我也想知道
I wish I did.

100
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,470
不过那是我最后一次见到他老人家
But that was the last I ever saw of him.

101
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,380
这就是我的故事
That's it... my life story.

102
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,590
不像我梦想的那般荣耀
Not exactly the glory I envisioned for myself

103
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,690
不过现在
... until now.

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,590
跟擎天柱在一起？
Being here with Optimus Prime...

105
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,910
我就知道我注定是块做大事的料
I knew I was destined for great things.

106
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,630
我是说 现在你有帮手了
I mean, now that you have help

107
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,590
结束这场战争能有多困难？
how hard could it be to end this war?

108
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,130
好好看看这个 新来的！
Take a good look, Newbie.

109
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,460
就有这么难！
This is how hard.

110
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,580
烟幕 我建议你花点时间适应下新环境
Smokescreen, I would suggest that you take some time to become acclimated to your new surroundings.

111
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,000
参观下基地是个不错的开始
A tour of the base would be an excellent start.

112
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,010
没问题！
Sure thing!

113
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,290
我的意思是 杰克可以提供一个内容丰富的旅程
I mean... Jack here offers a very informative tour.

114
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,080
这就是人类所谓的信息高速公路
This is what the humans call "the information superhighway".

115
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,070
一万亿个字节 没一个有用的！
A trillion gigabytes of data... none of it's useful!

116
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,230
尽管有些吸引人的奇怪东西
Though some oddly engrossing.

117
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,470
这是什么？
What is this?

118
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,510
啊… 愚蠢的生命体不知道他们找到的是什么
Ah... ignorant life-forms have no idea what they've uncovered.

119
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,280
红色能量
Red Energon.

120
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,430
如果我能拥有它的力量
If I can possess its power

121
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,180
我不仅能变得更强壮 也能变得更快
not only will I be stronger but also faster.

122
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,380
大大的加快！
Significantly faster.

123
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,220
相位仪 火种剥离器 静止器
Phase shifter... Spark extractor... Immobilizer...

124
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,000
这里保存的都是我们找到的埋藏在地球上的遗物
this is where we store the Cybertronian relics we found buried on Earth.

125
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,530
说起来世界真是小 因为这些大部分都来自…
And talk about a small universe 'cause most of them came from the...

126
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,330
铁堡档案馆
The Iacon hall of records.

127
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,470
我记得这些
I remember these.

128
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,240
哇哦！她算哪种遗物？
Whoa. What kind of relic is she?

129
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,090
你最好别招惹的那种
The kind you don't want to mess with.

130
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,210
如果你们想换掉我 最好叫千斤顶来！
If you wanted to replace me, you should have called Wheeljack.

131
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,740
那样我还能好受些
I could have lived with that.

132
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,990
没人要换掉你 隔板
No one is replacing you, Bulkhead.

133
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,480
况且烟幕还是个楞头青
For one thing, Smokescreen's too green.

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,920
隔板也够青
Well, Bulk's as green as they get.

135
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,470
阿尔茜的意思是
What Arcee means is...

136
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,300
烟幕需要学习的事情还有很多！
Smokescreen still has a great deal to learn.

137
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,020
那训练好他之后呢？
And once you got him trained, then what, huh?

138
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,630
他入伍？我退役？
He's in. I'm a doorstop.

139
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,610
隔板 你在我们中的位置不会受到任何影响
Bulkhead, your place with us is not in jeopardy

140
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,380
但毫无疑问的是 我们长久以来缺乏战斗力
but there is no dispute that we have long required additional firepower.

141
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,740
对于我们的队伍来说 现在应学会接纳新人
It is essential that our team learns to work with our new recruit

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,560
而不是排斥他
not against him.

143
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,980
但愿这小子的枪跟嘴一样厉害
Better hope the hotshot's blasters are as big as his mouth.

144
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,890
这有什么难的…
How hard can it be?

145
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,890
嘿 伙计们 看看这个
Hey, everyone. Check this out.

146
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,480
别告诉我又是大黄蜂目击新闻！哦 天啊！
But don't tell me it's another Bumblebee sight... oh my.

147
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,730
红色能量
Red Energon.

148
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,110
在地球上？
Here... on Earth?

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,170
红色能量是什么？
What's Red Energon?

150
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,810
一种十分稀有且极不稳定的能量形式
An extremely rare and volatile form of Energellum.

151
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,810
提炼出的燃料可以提供超高速
Refined into fuel, it provides the power of hyperspeed.

152
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,070
我们必须联系福勒探员 让他疏散挖掘地点附近的所有人类
We must have Agent Fowler clear the dig site of all human presence

153
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,350
我们不可能是唯一发现这个地点的人
in the event we are not the only ones who have discovered its location.

154
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,550
说得好
Now you're talking.

155
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,690
我们去打烂虎子的电路！
Let's scramble up some Cons' circuits.

156
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,870
鉴于你的实战经验有限
Given your limited field experience

157
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,000
我认为在参加战斗之前 你有必要接受更多的训练
I believe further training is required before you are battle-ready.

158
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,160
擎天柱 恕我直言…
Optimus, with all due respect...

159
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,530
此外 我们汽车人在地球上需要隐蔽
Furthermore, we Autobots live on this planet as robots in disguise.

160
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,940
你需要扫描一个地球的车辆形态
You will need to obtain an Earth-based vehicle mode.

161
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,250
为了保持低调行动
In order to maintain a low profile...

162
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,380
如果你能做得到的话
if that's possible for you.

163
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,430
你是说变车是吧？没问题！
If you're talking wheels, bring 'em on!

164
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,090
红色能量是我的 人类！
The Red Energon is mine, humans!

165
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,180
你们毫无胜算 因为你们面对的是伟大的红蜘…
For you are powerless in the face of the mighty Star...

166
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,180
什么？
What?

167
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,960
它哪儿去了？
Where is it?

168
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,280
不行
Nope.

169
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,580
那个怎么样？
How about that one?

170
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,530
呃 那速度更适合救护车 你不觉得吗？
Eh, it's more Ratchet's speed, don't you think?

171
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,190
水泥车？
Cement truck?

172
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,460
好吧 除非我是个挖地虎
Yeah, if I were a Constructicon.

173
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,480
老实说 这就是你们星球最拿得出手的？
Seriously, this is the best your planet has to offer?

174
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,270
不 这里毕竟是贾斯帕
No, but this is Jasper.

175
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,090
我找到了
I feel for you.

176
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,190
福勒就不能用吊车把它放下来吗？
Fowler couldn't have the crane operator lower the thing?

177
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,500
一定是人类准备把陨石装上货轮的时候
The humans must have been preparing to transfer the meteor to a cargo ship

178
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,190
接到了疏散指令
when they received his evacuation order.

179
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,340
滚回去 汽车人！
Run along home, Autobots.

180
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,210
那个红色能量本座指名要了！
That Red Energon has my name all over it.

181
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,150
并且我不惜为它而战！
And I am more than willing to fight for it.

182
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,970
夺取红色能量 叫救护车把它传送回基地
Secure the Red Energon and have Ratchet bridge it back to base.

183
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,700
别告诉我你忘了我们上次的交手了 擎天柱！
Don't tell me you've already forgotten our last encounter, Prime.

184
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,850
继续前进 小蜂！
Keep moving, Bee.

185
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,020
擎天柱 出什么情况了吗？
Optimus, is something wrong?

186
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,370
红蜘蛛来抢夺红色能量
Starscream has come for the Red Energon

187
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,950
恐怕没法让他打消这个念头
and I fear he will not be deterred in his quest.

188
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,040
红蜘蛛？我在塞博特恩听说过那个穿高跟鞋的家伙
Starscream? I heard stories about that stiletto-heeled creep back on Cybertron.

189
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,260
让我过去 医生！
Send me in, Doc.

190
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,150
如果擎天柱需要救援 他会提出的
When Optimus requires backup, he will ask for it.

191
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,760
噢 拜托 我已经准备好车辆形态了
Aw, come on. I got my V-mode and everything.

192
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,470
开足马力就等着出发了
I'm souped up and ready to roll.

193
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,700
打住！打住！
Eh! Eh! Eh!

194
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,790
更多的训练你听不懂吗？
What part of "further training" did you not understand?

195
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,100
爬得越高 摔得越惨！
The higher you climb, the harder you fall.

196
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,950
哈哈 汽车人 总是不长记性
Haha. Autobots... such slow learners.

197
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,280
擎天柱 你的情况怎么样？
Optimus, what is your status?

198
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,450
救护车 他们需要我 我能行的！
Ratchet, they need me. I can do this.

199
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,300
阿尔茜？大黄蜂？
Arcee? Bumblebee?

200
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,550
你听到我在说话了吗？
Did you hear what I said?

201
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,170
我听到了 但是没有理睬你
I heard, and I'm ignoring you.

202
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,320
看来你终于有机会了 烟幕…
This may be your opportunity after all, Smokescre...

203
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,040
烟幕呢？
Where is Smokescreen?

204
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,870
就是这个
That's the one.

205
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,130
你！
You, there!

206
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,180
看在火种源的份上 你知道你在做什么吗？
What in the name of the Allspark do you think you're doing?

207
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,510
要扔些重物下去了
Time to unload some more deadweight.

208
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,510
站稳了 汽车人！
Watch your step, Autobots!

209
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,110
很显然没人告诉他“低调”是什么意思
Apparently, no one defined "low profile" for him.

210
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,870
看来 汽车人有个新兵蛋子
So, the Autobots have a new recruit.

211
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,750
你就是红蜘蛛啊
And you must be Starscream.

212
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,610
还以为有多高大呢
I thought you'd be taller.

213
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,400
这下可不好收场了
This will not end well.

214
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,000
烟幕 退下！
Smokescreen, stand down.

215
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,150
你敌不过红蜘蛛的精锐护甲
You are no match for Starscream's Apex armor.

216
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,430
有什么遗言吗 烟幕？
Any last words, Smokescreen?

217
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,320
八个字：和你的盔甲吻别吧
Just four: kiss your armor goodbye!

218
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,920
相位仪？
A Phase shifter?

219
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,170
这可是个好点子！
Now, that was a plan!

220
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,920
你可不是唯一一个带着腕式装备的人！
You aren't the only one sporting a fancy wrist-mounted device.

221
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,420
动动脑筋吧！
Think fast!

222
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,180
不！
No!

223
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,880
都说了不过是借用一会儿！
Told you I just needed to borrow it for a while.

224
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,520
医生却认为我要偷你们的遗物
Doc here thought I was trying to steal your relics.

225
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,770
除非你先解释你的计划
Only until you explained your plan

226
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,940
而后得到我的批准
which I then sanctioned.

227
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,720
这叫做协议
It's called protocol.

228
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,410
救护车是对的
Ratchet is correct.

229
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,210
规则适用于队伍中的所有成员
Standard procedure must be observed by every member of this team.

230
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,720
不过 我相信烟幕是值得称赞的
However... I believe we must also commend Smokescreen.

231
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,780
你在选择策略制造声势方面学习的很快
You have proven to be a quick study by choosing to place strategy above bravado.

232
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,390
看来要开始和他一起生活了
There is gonna be no living with him now.

233
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,870
虽然这个仪式不如精英卫队那样壮观
While this may lack the pageantry of a proper Elite Guard ceremony

234
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,620
我真诚地欢迎你加入领袖卫队！
I wish to welcome you to team Prime.

235
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,490
这个新人确实干得不赖…
The Newbie did all right.

236
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,330
别担心 小隔
Don't worry, Bulk.

237
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,770
他不会抢你的饭碗的！
He's got nothing on you.

238
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,830
真的 一旦你的腿伤愈复出了
Seriously, once we get that leg of yours back in shape

239
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,120
烟幕就会知道谁是这里最强的粉碎球了！
old Smokey's gonna learn real quick who the top wrecking ball is run here.

240
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,200
隔板？
Bulkhead?
