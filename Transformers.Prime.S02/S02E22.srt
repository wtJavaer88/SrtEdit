1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,030
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime...

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,440
找到最后四个铁堡遗物是我们的当务之急
It is paramount that we recover the final four Iacon relics...

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,480
它们是“终极之钥”
the Omega keys.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,210
钥匙？
Keys?

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,390
能打开什么？
To what?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,620
我们的故乡涅重生的关键…
The regeneration of our home planet.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,620
一座古墓？
A tomb.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,090
据说这座古墓里长眠着一位元祖领袖！
One known to contain the remains of Primes.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,530
终于 领袖的力量现在属于我了！
At long last, the power of the Primes belongs to me!

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,260
钛师傅的讯息里还剩下四组加密坐标
Four sets of coordinates from Alpha Trion remain encrypted.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,140
我们可以推断出那就是终极之钥的位置
It is logical to conclude that each corresponds to the location of one of the Omega keys.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,380
这是我的第一件作品
My first creation

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,060
以宇宙大帝之血铸就
fashioned from the very blood of Unicron.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,930
我称之为暗黑星辰剑
I call it the Dark Star Saber.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,790
快点 交出遗物
The relic. now!

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,430
哦 你是说这个？谁找到归谁！
Oh, you mean this? Finders keepers.

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,050
你该看看擎天柱当时的表情！
You should have seen Optimus Prime's face

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,330
当他的宝贝星辰剑连同他的美梦\N和汽车人的胜利一起如玻璃般破碎之时
when his precious Star Saber shattered like glass and, with it his dreams of an Autobot victory.

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,270
毫无疑问
Granted

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,180
擎天柱抢占剩余遗物的决心会更加坚决
Optimus will be more determined than ever to discover

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,450
啊 很好
Ah, very good.

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,260
看来你已破译出了下一个坐标
I see you have decoded the next set of coordinates.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,920
真有你的 声波
Way to step things up, Soundwave.

24
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,900
我真希望这回别又是什么神圣之物
I do hope this Iacon relic is something less sacred and more profane

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,600
最好是电磁毁灭炮之类的
like an electro-disruptor cannon.

26
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,430
那会更加实用
We could use one of those.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,560
说的不错 击倒
Indeed, Knockout.

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,350
骇翼 立刻向舰桥报告！
Dreadwing, report to the bridge immediately.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,290
我恳求您 威震天陛下
Please, lord Megatron

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,520
将找回遗物的荣耀赐予属下
allow me the honor of retrieving this relic for you.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,570
我很惊讶 那次“事故”之后 你这么快就无所畏惧了么？
I'm surprised you would risk your finish so soon after your accident.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,410
尽管如此 我还是反复劝说自己 你是这次任务的最佳人选
Nonetheless, I remain unconvinced that you are the best choice for the task

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,190
虽然你没能拿回相位仪
since you failed to secure the phase shifter.

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,350
那是因为我缺乏合适的工具
I lacked the proper tools.

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,000
既然声波现在抽不出身
But since Soundwave's currently occupied

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,960
我想您不会介意我借用一下这个
I can't imagine he'll mind if I borrow this...

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,850
用它来带回您的战利品
So that I might better secure your prize

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,320
同时狠狠地教训那些汽车人！
and heap some hurt on the Autobots.

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,230
总有一天 我要成为像擎天柱那样伟大的战士
I'm gonna be a great warrior someday, like Optimus.

40
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,240
没错…好好学习 天天向上
Well, train hard and gain some wisdom along the way

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,350
你一定能如愿以偿的
and I'm sure it'll happen.

42
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,660
哦 那当然 这可是我的宿命
Oh, it will. It's my destiny.

43
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,190
何以见得？
How so?

44
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,430
你看 一分钟前我还在铁堡当保安
Well, one minute I'm on security detail at Iacon.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,240
下一分钟我醒来 就到了银河系的另一边
The next, I wake up on the other side of the galaxy

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,710
成为了擎天柱的部下
to find myself under Optimus' command.

47
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,550
我是说 这种事可不常见吧？
I mean, what are the chances, right?

48
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,270
这…这一定事出有因
Things happen for a reason.

49
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,130
我们懂了 烟幕
We get it, Smokescreen.

50
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,670
你是特别的 有你在是我们的造化
You're special. We're lucky to have you.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,110
我真正想说的只是…
All I'm really saying is

52
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,110
我跋山涉水来到这里 可不想辜负了这个机会
I've come a long way, and this is one opportunity I don't plan on messing up.

53
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,660
汽车人 下一个铁堡遗物的坐标已经破解
Autobots, the next Iacon coordinates have been decoded.

54
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,440
救护车 准备好环陆桥
Ratchet, ready the ground bridge.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,920
最后一个摸到终极之钥的 倒一个礼拜能量废罐！
Last one to the Omega key has to scrub the Energon tanks for a week.

56
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,580
我们还计分呢？
Didn't know we were keeping score.

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,670
阿尔茜 大黄蜂 准备出发！
Arcee, Bumblebee, prepare to roll out.

58
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,440
等等！那我呢？
Wait. What about me?

59
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,580
哼
Hum.

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,810
我是说 我和隔板呢？
I mean me and Bulkhead.

61
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,080
你们二人在此待命
The two of you will remain here

62
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,400
以防我在他们回来之前就破译出下一个坐标
in the event i'm able to decode a subsequent database entry before the others return.

63
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,410
擎天柱是对的 考虑到塞博特恩的命运危在旦夕
Optimus is right. Considering the very fate of Cybertron is at stake

64
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,320
反应时间就至关重要
response time is critical.

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,340
敬候佳音吧 小子
Keep your engines idling, kid.

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,180
走吧 小蜂“宿命”在等着我们呢
Come on, Bee. Destiny awaits.

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,980
这叫中场休息
We call it a pit stop.

68
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,870
咱们会回到赛场的
We'll get back in the race.

69
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,280
在那儿
Over there.

70
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,210
看谁来了 正是人家所期待的呢
Well, well, just the Autobots I wanted to see.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,540
我来对付变态医生 你去抢钥匙
I'll handle the mad doctor. You grab the key.

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,990
人家正想为过往的回忆…感谢你们呢！
I've been waiting to thank you both for all the memories.

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,750
谁能想到“声波”也有如此魅力…能“击倒”众生！
Who knew that sound waves could be such a.... Knockout?

74
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,680
脚步声太慌张了 我都能听到！
What's that, dear? I can't hear you!

75
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,220
小蜂 快抢遗物！
Bee, the relic!

76
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,000
讨厌！
Scrap.

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,210
这东西…也能这么用
How low can it go?

78
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,370
要么放手要么去死
Subwoofer or depth charge?

79
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,180
糟了！
Scrap.

80
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,760
嗯…这个和擎天柱从我手中抢走的一模一样
It appears identical to the one taken from me by Optimus Prime.

81
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,360
或许这是汽车人故意让你抢走的赝品
Ah. Perhaps it is a decoy the Autobots allowed you to seize

82
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,830
好妨碍我们的行动？
as a means of sabotage.

83
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,410
看起来不像 我的君王
Unlikely, my liege.

84
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,680
他们为夺此物简直是奋不顾身
They battled too desperately for it.

85
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,850
或许 这只是整盘棋局里的一小步？
Then pieces of a larger puzzle, perhaps.

86
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,790
做得好 声波
Excellent, Soundwave.

87
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,640
运气好的话 这些新坐标会为我们理清头绪
Coordinates will shed some light on the subject.

88
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,590
声波真是锋头正劲啊 我也一样！
Soundwave's on fire. And so I am.

89
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,690
别被虚荣冲昏了头脑 医生
Keep your vanity in check, doctor.

90
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,990
难道我还没证明自己吗？
Haven't I proven myself?!

91
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,440
对我而言 你更大的价值在于使用专业的科学技能
Your scientific expertise remains of greater use to me

92
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,120
来分析我们新的战利品
analyzing our latest acquisition.

93
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,800
我必须知道这是何物 有何用途
I must know what this relic is and what it can do.

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,460
对不起 擎天柱
I'm sorry, Optimus.

95
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,240
击倒早就等在那里了
Knockout was there, waiting for us.

96
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,740
看来虎子们的破译水平提高了
Seems the 'Cons are improving their decoding skills.

97
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,350
鉴于两块终极之钥已经分开
And it seems that, with two keys already separated

98
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,150
眼下无人能让塞博特恩重现生机了
no one currently possesses the means to revive Cybertron.

99
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,370
尽管我们复兴故乡的工作陷入了僵局
While our quest to restore our planet may have reached a stalemate

100
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,920
保护好已有的终极之钥仍是当务之急
securing the remaining keys is still the most prudent course of action.

101
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,520
天啊 击倒还有那声波武器什么的一定很刺激！
Man, it must have been crazy with Knockout going all sonic.

102
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,620
我真希望当时也在场 好…
Oh, I wish I'd been there. I would have...

103
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,610
好什么？
Would have what?

104
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,520
好像上一次一样夺回钥匙？
Recovered the key like you did the first one?

105
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,980
或许吧 谁知道呢？
Maybe. Who knows?

106
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,270
我只是想把所见之物都轰成渣
I just want us to be firing on all cylinders

107
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,200
你知道 我们已经失去了星辰剑
you know, now that the Star Saber's gone.

108
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,850
而我目前为止干得还不错
And I have a pretty good track record so far.

109
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,600
听着 小子 阿尔茜和大黄蜂并没有气馁
Look, kid, Arcee and Bumblebee are no slouches

110
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,940
在没有那把大剑的漫长岁月中 擎天柱也一直做得很好
and Optimus managed just fine for eons without the big sword.

111
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,030
当然 你不可能知道这些
Of course, you wouldn't know about that.

112
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,570
当我们在此奋战之时 你还在外太空飘着呢！
And you've been locked in stasis the whole time we've been fighting this war.

113
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,810
所以！我已准备好弥补错失的时间了！
Exactly, and I'm ready to make up for lost time.

114
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,130
那得等擎天柱说你行才可以
When Optimus says you're ready.

115
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,410
你要耐心等待
You got to be in this for the long haul.

116
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,760
稳扎稳打才能赢得比赛
Slow and steady wins the race.

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,260
啊…怎么还没好！
Hurry up, already!

118
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,380
提速能量怎么会比普通能量液化得更慢？！
How is it possible that speed-enhancing Energon takes longer to process than regular Energon?!

119
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,610
整整一大块红色能量才液化成这么一丁点儿？
An entire chunk of Red Energon, and this is all I get?!

120
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,670
这顶多够我喝一口…最多两口！
There's enough here for one dose, maybe two!

121
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,820
霸天虎有动作了？
Mmm. Decepticon movement.

122
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,000
超级速度或许代替不了精锐护甲的强大威力
While speed is hardly a suitable replacement for the might of the Apex armor

123
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,310
不过 却能让我在抢夺强大的先祖遗物时占尽先机
it should provide me with enough of an edge to obtain a more formidable relic.

124
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,170
下一个坐标破译了！
The next coordinates are ready.

125
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,050
那么只剩最后一个了
There remains one set left to decode.

126
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,700
马上就去 老大
On it, boss.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,460
我一定会把钥匙带回来
I'm gonna bring back that key.

128
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,680
嗯…小隔
Uh, Bulk?

129
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,180
是不是落下什么了？
Forgetting something?

130
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,740
看好咱们的“宿命之子” 好吗？
Make sure you keep an eye on destiny's child, okay?

131
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,760
哈…跟照顾神子比起来 简直小菜一碟
Compared to watching Miko, piece of cake.

132
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,100
靠近点 提高警惕
Stick close. And stay focused.

133
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,440
我懂
Gotcha!

134
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,540
我是认真的！
I mean it.

135
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,300
我也是！
Me too.

136
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,380
那是什么声音？
What is that?

137
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,810
是你丧钟的鸣响！
One of the last sounds that you will ever hear.

138
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,330
骇翼…
Dreadwing.

139
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,450
我们得马上离开这儿 快！
We got to get out of here, now!

140
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,640
烟仔 我来对付骇翼 你快去拿遗物！
Smoke, I'll handle Dreadwing. Go get the relic.

141
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,030
没问题！
You got it.

142
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,770
你就喜欢躲在暗处放冷箭 对吧？
You love doing your dirty work from a distance, don't you?

143
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,890
真可惜 你没种跟我堂堂正正地较量一番！
Too bad you don't have the ball bearings to fight up close and personal.

144
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,600
就目前的情况而言
In this particular case

145
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,910
我很乐意为你破例！
I will be all too happy to make an exception.

146
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,350
你的努力值得夸奖
An admirable effort

147
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,580
但你显然忘了咱们上次的交手是如何收场的
but you obviously forgot how our last encounter ended.

148
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,750
不 我没忘
No, I didn't.

149
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,140
烟仔 我马上就来
Smoke, I'm on my way.

150
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,860
我的宿命…
Destiny.

151
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,740
烟幕！醒醒！
Smokescreen! Wake up!

152
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,510
呃…发生什么事了？
Wh-what happened?

153
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,920
我还想问你呢
That's what I want to know.

154
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,200
终极之钥！
The Omega key.

155
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,390
我都拿到了！
I had it

156
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,620
直到什么东西从背后袭击了我…
until something hit me from behind.

157
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,860
骇翼肯定有帮手
Dreadwing must have had backup.

158
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,750
那个遗物早就被带走了
That relic's long gone.

159
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,080
救护车 打开环陆桥
Ratchet, we need a bridge.

160
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,520
我…我答应过擎天柱会把钥匙带回去…
I-I told Optimus I'd return with that key.

161
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,620
听着 孩子 钛师傅说过我们得把四个钥匙都弄到手
Listen, kid, Alpha Trion said we need all four keys

162
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,690
才能让塞博特恩重生 记得吗？
to restore Cybertron, remember?

163
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,210
我们只要保护好手头上的
We just need to hang on to the one we have

164
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,560
再想法从威震天那里把剩下的抢过来就行了
and find a way to get the others back from Megatron.

165
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,370
塞博特恩重生的希望…掌握在我的手上
The promise of a new Cybertron in the palm of my hand...

166
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,140
只要我能集齐全部四把钥匙！
when I obtain all four.

167
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,510
烟幕是被人打了闷棍
Smokescreen was sucker-punched.

168
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,050
换了谁都会中招的
Could have happened to any of us.

169
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,740
事实并非如此！
But it didn't

170
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,950
分明是我放下了戒心
because I was the one who dropped his guard.

171
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,420
是我搞砸了任务
I was the one who blew it.

172
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,230
我这算哪门子的“伟大”战士
Some great warrior I'm turning out to be.

173
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,310
你还是没搞懂 是吗？
You still don't get it, do you?

174
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,220
几次胜利是不足以让你成为传奇的
A couple of victories aren't gonna make you a legend.

175
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,680
也不是每次任务都能成功
And not every mission results in success

176
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,470
我不能 小蜂不能 甚至包括擎天柱在内
not for me, not for Bee, not even for Optimus.

177
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,860
我们得到了一些遗物 也失去了一些
We've gained relics, and we've lost some.

178
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,250
我们还失去过朋友 甚至失去了一个世界
We've also lost friends. We've even lost a world.

179
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,030
但是 这一次我们可以从头再来
But this is one time we get a do-over.

180
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,860
现在我们有机会让塞博特恩重生
We have a chance to bring back Cybertron

181
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,560
这是在场的每个人的事！
and everyone in this room needs to be in sync.

182
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,370
而不是你一个人的“宿命”
This isn't about you or your destiny.

183
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,920
阿尔茜 你说得够清楚了
Arcee, you have made your point.

184
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,130
擎天柱 他需要彻底明白
Optimus, he needs to hear this.

185
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,760
或许有一天 你真的成为了一名伟大的战士
You might actually become a great warrior one day

186
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,960
我真心希望如此
and I sincerely hope that you do.

187
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,700
但以团队为重才能造就伟大
But greatness begins and ends with putting the team first

188
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,460
只顾个人表现是行不通的！
not your personal scorecard.

189
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,800
我愿意为大家做任何事！
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you guys.

190
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,210
那就别总去逞英雄了
Then stop trying to be a hero

191
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,340
先学着当一个汽车人吧
and start being an Autobot.

192
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,510
你知道吗？
You know what?

193
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,060
或许是我还不够优秀！
Maybe I'm just not good enough.

194
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,330
下回擎天柱建议你打住的时候
Next time Optimus advises you to stop

195
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,990
你或许应该听他的
perhaps you should listen.

196
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,360
我去把他叫回来
I'll bring him back.

197
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,890
烟幕还年轻 隔板
Smokescreen is young, Bulkhead

198
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,370
还有很多东西要学
and has much to learn

199
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,270
不过现在 他需要理清一下思绪
but right now he needs to clear his thoughts.

200
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,220
我则需要破译最后一个铁堡坐标
And I need to finish decoding the final Iacon entry.

201
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,950
你竟然连遗物的影子都没瞅着？！
You never even spied the relic?!

202
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,570
当我到达时 它已经不见了…
By the time I reached the location, it was gone

203
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,590
汽车人也不见了
as were the Autobots.

204
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,550
优秀的忠仆不仅能抢在擎天柱之前\N破译最后一件遗物的位置
It would serve us well to not only decode the final Iacon entry before Optimus Prime does

205
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
还能抢回汽车人手中的那些！
but to recapture those relics currently held by the Autobots.

206
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,910
声波 把你的主要工作先放一放
Soundwave. Despite your primary task

207
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,670
我相信对汽车人基地的定位 你已取得进展
I trust that you have been making progress pinpointing the location of their base.

208
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,000
很好 根据最近得到的线索
Good. Given the recent accumulation of evidence

209
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,050
我们已掌握了他们的人类同伙的确切位置
we possess a clearer idea of where their human colleagues reside.

210
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,030
激光鸟应该很快就能抵近汽车人的藏身之处
And Laserbeak should soon determine whether the Autobots dwell in proximity.

211
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,790
啊 最后一组坐标也破解了
Ah. The final entry has been decoded.

212
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,670
你确定？
Has it?

213
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,380
唔…可能还有一层二级加密
Perhaps it's a layer of secondary encryption.

214
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,460
坐标正在形成一幅图像
The coordinates are forming an image.

215
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,900
为何最后的铁堡记录会如此与众不同呢？
Why would the final Iacon entry be different from the others?

216
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,420
没准儿这是遗物的图？
Maybe it's a picture of the relic.

217
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,890
不知道地点的话 光要这图能有什么用？
Of what possible use could that be to us without knowing its location?

218
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,230
我相信钛师傅自有原因
I trust that Alpha Trion has his reasons.

219
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,380
这是烟幕？！
Smokescreen?

220
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,910
擎天柱的新兵…
Prime's latest recruit

221
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,810
是最后一个铁堡遗物？
is the final relic of Iacon?

222
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,840
…那会是激射开的玩笑吗？
Is this that hotshot's idea of a joke?

223
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,750
没准儿烟幕知道钥匙在哪儿！
Maybe he knows where the key is.

224
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,730
…那他只是懒得说了？
And never bothered to mention it?

225
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,720
最可能的情况是
A more likely possibility

226
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,410
烟幕本身就是那个钥匙 而他自己却不知情！
is that Smokescreen himself somehow is the key, without knowing it.

227
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,780
无论如何 他现在的处境都极度危险！
Whatever the case, he could be in grave danger.

228
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,380
烟幕 立刻返回基地！
Smokescreen, return to base immediately.

229
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,560
他可能关掉通讯器了
He may have deactivated his comm link.

230
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,520
锁定他的位置 开启环陆桥！
Locate his position and prepare the ground bridge.

231
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,720
看来我们的次要计划 已经有回报了
It seems our side project is already paying off.

232
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,340
老子今天心情不好 虎子！
You picked the wrong day to mess with me, 'Con.

233
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,100
烟幕…
Smokescreen.

234
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,460
不！
No!
