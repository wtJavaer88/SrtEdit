Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.68,0:00:20.13,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And, with the Matrix of Leadership,

Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.53,0:00:28.28,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Though at immeasurable personal cost...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.63,0:00:31.02,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,When Optimus surrendered the Matrix
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.02,0:00:34.63,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,he'd lost more than the collective wisdom of the Primes.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.21,0:00:54.63,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If Optimus did not know his own name,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.17,0:00:59.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,perhaps it is because the title of Prime hasn't yet been granted to him.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.90,0:01:44.94,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Is it wise, to allow an Autobot, current or former,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.06,0:01:47.09,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,full run of the premises?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.24,0:01:50.16,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Nothing happens aboard this ship without my knowledge.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.42,0:01:53.21,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You will do well to remember that, Airachnid.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.48,0:01:55.68,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But there's no need for concern.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.80,0:02:00.07,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Orion does not possess the same fight Optimus is so renown for.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.80,0:05:03.24,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Because the Warlord Ratchet's careless actions

Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.53,0:05:50.20,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So, you mean Jack's like some kinda honorary Prime?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.35,0:05:56.90,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Let's just say, Jack is the only one who can return Optimus to the Autobot we knew.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.04,0:06:01.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But why would Optimus willfully endanger a human? A child?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.14,0:06:02.68,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm not a child, Mom!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.98,0:06:05.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe Optimus believes there's more to Jack than meets the eye.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.80,0:06:07.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,All of which is moot.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.66,0:06:22.38,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Miko, the Ground bridge barely got them into Earth orbit, remember?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.52,0:06:24.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, but Ratchet built it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.36,0:06:26.04,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Can't he just turbo-charge the thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.60,0:06:35.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I cannot believe Ratchet capable of such horrors.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.93,0:06:42.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes. And to think the Doctor of Doom's mad quest for power continues...

Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.07,0:06:59.77,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Why are we called Decepticons?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.64,0:07:04.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Another craven Autobot scare tactic.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.79,0:07:06.92,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The name was meant to demonize us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.03,0:07:10.04,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Instead, we wear it as a badge of honour.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.40,0:07:12.89,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,For if speaking the truth is deception,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.16,0:07:15.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,then we are gladly guilty.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.48,0:07:19.10,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Now please, Orion.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.22,0:07:21.53,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,There will be plenty of time for catching up.
