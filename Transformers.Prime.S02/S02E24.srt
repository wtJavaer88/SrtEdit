1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,710
在上一集中
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,430
有一套啊 你这小滑头！
Well, aren't you the clever one?

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,480
你正好给那些胆敢让我失望之人
You shall serve as a constant reminder to those who dare

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,710
做个警示！
fail me.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,770
什么？！
What?!

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,180
现在有三枚钥匙了
Three keys are accounted for.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,480
看来这地儿现在由我做主
It would seem I have the run of the place.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,470
啊 在这儿呐！
Ah, there you are.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,850
无论红蜘蛛有何企图
The fate of Cybertron now rests in Starscream's hands...

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,320
塞博特恩的命运都掌握在他手中了…
whatever his intention.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,550
请原谅我的不请自来 威震天陛下
Please pardon my unannounced visit, Lord Megatron.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,870
小人有礼物敬呈于您…
But I have come bearing a peace offering.

13
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,410
天下没有白吃的午餐 说吧 红蜘蛛
Few things of value come without a price. So, tell me, Starscream.

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,150
你想要什么回报？
What is it that you wish in return?

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,800
小人只愿重回霸天虎之列
Only to be a Decepticon once again.

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,400
我现在的副官是骇翼
Dreadwing is my first lieutenant now.

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,850
在我缺席期间发生的变故 我已坦然接受
And I accept that much has changed during my absence.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,990
我只想为您效力
I only wish to serve you

19
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,350
我唯一真正的主人
my one true master

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,150
任您差遣 绝无怨言
in any way that you deem fit.

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,550
你此次立下大功 我深感欣慰 红蜘蛛
I am deeply impressed by your accomplishment, Starscream.

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,730
你的贡献 我必将善加用之
And know that I will put your offerings to good use

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,510
无论结果如何…
whatever the outcome.

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,490
啊 结果？什么结果？！
Uh, outcome? Of what?

25
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,480
赶快把击倒从墙中挖出来！
See to it that Knockout is extracted from the wall.

26
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,860
啊…
Ah.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,860
人家自由了！
It's good to be back.

28
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:07,260
这次您想知道什么呢 我的君王？
Now, what will we be fishing for today, my liege?

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,530
红蜘蛛的真实意图！
Starscream's true motives.

30
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,110
霸天虎们 我怀着沉痛的心情
Decepticons, it is with deep sorrow

31
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,570
向大家宣告…
that I note for the log

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,890
威震天的火种已经熄灭了
Megatron's spark has been extinguished.

33
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,620
红蜘蛛…万…岁！
All hail Starscream.

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,510
红蜘蛛万岁！
All hail Starscream!

35
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,810
哎呀呀 你可真是惜时如金呐
Well, well. You certainly didn't waste any time.

36
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,850
什么？！
What?!

37
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,000
我刚才看见你已经死了！
I just watched you perish!

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,690
昔日的我未曾覆灭
I did not perish then

39
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,050
而今的我与你相随！
and I'm very much with you now...

40
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,600
此时此刻你我同在…
the present you

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,260
恰如彼时彼刻！
as well as the past.

42
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,900
红蜘蛛万岁！
All hail Starscream!

43
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,410
本座听不见…
I can't hear you!

44
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,580
红蜘蛛万岁！
All hail Starscream!

45
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,790
再来一次！
One more time!

46
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,500
红蜘蛛万岁！
All hail Starscream! 

47
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,160
沙发看戏…
This is going to be juicy.

48
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,570
呃…您正在小人脑中 是么？
Ah! You're inside my head, aren't you?

49
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,300
这是大脑神经接入器
The cortical psychic patch.

50
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,400
如你所见 此地只有记忆 没有秘密
You see, there are no secrets in here... only your memories.

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,930
你既无法操纵其内容
You cannot manipulate their content

52
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,960
也无法修饰其结果
or modify their outcome.

53
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,180
你我所见的是曾经发生的事实！
What we see is how it happened.

54
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,060
如果你想成为一个真正的首领 红蜘蛛
If you want to be a true leader, Starscream

55
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,660
那就不要走威震天的老路
then stray from Megatron's path

56
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,890
你要带领霸天虎走向和平
and lead the Decepticons toward peace.

57
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,960
我会真心考虑停战的
I would be willing to consider a truce...

58
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,930
只要你真心向我称臣 擎天柱
if you would be willing to bow before me, Optimus Prime.

59
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,390
你又违背本座的命令了！
You have defied my orders yet again!

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,830
这是我的失误 长官
My mistake, Commander Starscream.

61
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,820
叫我陛下！
It is Lord!

62
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,640
你没听说吗？
Haven't you heard?

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,090
本座如今贵为霸天虎统领！
I lead the Decepticons now.

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,510
我们看到哪儿了？
Now, where did we leave off?

65
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,740
喔对
Oh, yes.

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,790
红蜘蛛万岁？
"All hail Starscream"?

67
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,310
提一个明显的小小争议：
A rather obvious motif, Starscream.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,650
你竟自视比我更有资格领导霸天虎？
You deem yourself more able to lead the Decepticons than myself?!

69
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,560
不！不再是了！
No, not anymore.

70
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,370
在经历如此之多的失败以后 主人
I have learned from my many failures, master.

71
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,250
我亲爱的成员们
Esteemed members of my armada...

72
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:44,580
你们即将见证 本座长久以来不懈追求的光荣时刻
you now stand upon the very precipice of glory... to meet the destiny which I have so tenaciously worked toward.

73
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,430
霸天虎的领导权应该轮流坐庄！
Dynamic leadership of the Decepticons.

74
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,270
那是克隆体说的 不是我！
That clone said it, not me!

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,550
看来 你并未阻止任何颠覆我政权的言行
It seems you would stop at nothing to disrupt my rule

76
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,890
包括那场行刺！
including assassination.

77
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,250
那是他们的主意 不是我的！
It was their idea, not mine!

78
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,140
我们有了这种听从你指挥的生物
With this creature under your control and at our disposal

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,720
我们可以用他去了结威震天
we might employ it to terminate Megatron

80
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,590
夺取霸天虎的控制权
allowing us to rule the Decepticons.

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,190
这里没有什么克隆体 这也是他们的主意？
I see no clones here. Was this their idea, too?

82
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,660
小人对此毫无印象…
I don't remember any of this.

83
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,350
我那时一定是在抽风呢
I must have been half-crazed at the time

84
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,900
肯定是没能量吃 饿昏了头！
a victim of Energon deficiency.

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,260
告诉我为什么要欢迎你？
Tell me why I should welcome back someone

86
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,330
你生命中的每一次脉冲 都用来刺伤我
whose every waking impulse has been to thwart me

87
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,360
暗算我
undercut me

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,090
推翻我！
overthrow me?!

89
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,420
绝非如此！
Not true.

90
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,480
小人一直视陛下之命重于泰山！
I have always put your well-being before my own.

91
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,000
这就是所谓的“重于泰山”？
How does this revolting chapter constitute attending to my well-being?

92
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,440
我只是想帮您
I was simply trying to help

93
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,510
以免黑暗能量污染您的圣体！
by ridding you of the dark matter polluting your body.

94
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,190
看来我拥有唯一一个
Seems I possess the only thing that

95
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,660
能让你从病榻上重新站起来的东西！
would allow you to rise off that slab and walk again

96
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,930
最最亲爱的威震天…
my dearest Megatron.

97
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,570
我甚至为您险些被活埋！
I even risked being buried alive for you.

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,360
我…我没有抛下您 主人
I did not abandon you, master.

99
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,640
我回来…是要救您！
I returned to save you!

100
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,550
火种可鉴 威震天陛下
Look into my spark, Lord Megatron.

101
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,520
我是真心的！
My intentions were true.

102
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,130
真是如此吗 红蜘蛛？
Were they, Starscream?

103
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,650
你这辈子真心过吗？
Were they ever?!

104
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,250
现在轮到谁翻不了身啦？
Well, now who has hit rock bottom?

105
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,830
说什么？对不起
What's that? I'm sorry.

106
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,710
隔着一座五行山 我什么都听不清
I can't hear you beneath all that rubble.

107
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,790
哈哈…告辞了 威震天陛下！
Ha ha... Farewell, Lord Megatron.

108
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,700
愿你一锈到底！
May you rust in peace!

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,480
不过 这种遭遇对你来说是小儿科
But you have survived far worse.

110
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,140
如果你自己逃了出来
If you managed to free yourself

111
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,520
就会怪罪我见死不救
you would blame me for your setback.

112
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,210
你发火的时候 我肯定会理亏
And there is nowhere that I could possible escape from your wrath.

113
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,780
更不用说
Or, worse yet

114
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,730
那些傻瓜随从肯定会来找你
your mindless followers will come looking for you

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,410
并因为营救你而立功
and take credit for your rescue...

116
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,050
这个功劳 应该属于我！
credit that could rightfully be mine!

117
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,910
啊啊！威震天！
Ah! Megatron!

118
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,500
听我一句忠告…
A word of advice?

119
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,970
…别再把心里话大声喊出来了！
Stop thinking aloud.

120
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,700
我已经不想再玩这个游戏了！
I don't want to play this game anymore.

121
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,970
拿走钥匙吧！
Take the keys.

122
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,830
就当这事儿没发生过！
We'll pretend I was never here.

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,590
没门儿 红蜘蛛！
No, Starscream.

124
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,260
此事只能有两种结果
There are only two possible outcomes

125
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,320
待我彻底看透你这颗扭曲的心灵之后
based upon what I find here in your twisted, little mind.

126
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,200
若是我发现你没有资格重回霸天虎之列
If I do not deem that you are worthy of rejoining the Decepticons

127
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,960
那今天就是你的末日！
you will perish on this very day.

128
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,500
啊 杀死我是不是过于极端了？
Ah. Isn't termination rather extreme?

129
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,030
我是指…您平日的教训就很有效了…不是么？
I mean, a really good trouncing usually straightens me out, doesn't it?

130
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,310
不 主人 不要！
No, master. Nooo!

131
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,280
您何不对我作为霸天虎的天赋善加利用呢？
Why wouldn't you wish to harness my talents for the Decepticon cause?

132
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,590
您知道我的狡猾也能派上用场！
You and I have so much deviousness to offer.

133
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,850
就当是为您的回归献上的贺礼！
Consider it a "welcome home" present.

134
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,510
您瞧 我也可以变得慷慨 陛下！
See how generous I can be, my liege?

135
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,990
你只在必要的时候
When it suits you...

136
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,920
主人 那就是你的计划？
Master, that's your plan?!

137
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,070
复活死掉的汽车人 让我们挨揍？
Bring Autobots back from the dead to attack us?!

138
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,130
随后 你立即就变得傲慢无礼！
At other times, you could be quite insulant.

139
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,180
我很抱歉
Apologies.

140
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,620
我只是…初次杀死那个汽车人时 费了不少周折！
It's just that I'd gone to so much trouble to terminate the Autobot in the first place.

141
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,480
只有像战士一样杀死他才会如此！
Trouble would have been facing him as a gladiator.

142
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,890
小人一向认为智慧才是最犀利的武器
I've always considered my wits to be my sharpest weapon.

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,580
慢着
Wait.

144
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,630
你们想算计我！
You two are up to something.

145
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,670
你从不吸取教训 红蜘蛛
You never learn, Starscream.

146
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,580
你的傲慢凌驾于智慧之上！
Your arrogance will trump your wits every time.

147
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,260
你伤不了我
You cannot harm me

148
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,740
黑暗能量已经流遍了我的经脉 我已不可战胜！
while Dark Energon flows through my veins! I am invincible!

149
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,420
你个头很大
You're a big one.

150
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,100
吸收时间要长一点了
This could take a while.

151
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,380
什么？她把杀掉他的功劳安在自己头上？！
What? She's taking credit for scraping him now, too?

152
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,820
那是我干的！
That was my doing!

153
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,460
噢不！不要！呃…别开枪！
Oh, no! No! Eh... No!

154
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,870
有什么遗言吗 烟幕？
Any last words, Smokescreen?

155
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,700
我的变形齿轮
My T-Cog.

156
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,340
嗯 只是一个暂时的小插曲
A, uh... a temporary setback.

157
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,520
还有其他汽车人 其他的变形齿轮
Other Autobots, other T-Cogs.

158
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,310
我们很快就能找到另一个
We shall find a replacement soon enough.

159
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,750
那不够快 现在就要！
Not "soon enough". Now.

160
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,540
呃…啊！怎么？！
Huh? Ah! What?

161
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,810
汽车人！
Autobots!

162
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,260
我的变形齿轮！
My T-Cog!

163
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,700
你已经不能再飞了？
You no longer possess the ability to take flight?!

164
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,730
是的…我刚想说这件事…
Uh, yes, I-I was going to bring that up.

165
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,250
您可以想象 我目前的窘境令我无比痛苦！
And, as you might imagine, my predicament pains me to no end.

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,960
很幸运 先驱号的追踪系统\N还能追踪到威震天的战舰
Fortunately, the Harbingers' tracking systems have remained synched with Megatron's warship.

167
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,780
当然我们要先想个办法登上去
Of course, we shall require a means of reaching the...

168
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,200
啊？你们能变形？
Huh? You can transform?!

169
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,620
啊对 你们当然能变形！
Uh, of course you can.

170
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,430
否则怎么飞到飞船上去？
How else would you fly to the ship?

171
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,820
我只是想考验一下 你们都通过了
That was a test in which you all... passed.

172
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,470
我希望您考虑下帮我重拾飞机形态
I hope that you might see fit to express your gratitude for the Omega keys

173
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,130
当做我送来“终极之钥”的回报
by restoring my jet mode.

174
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,900
毕竟
After all

175
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,970
能飞的我 对您的用处更大
would I not be more valuable to you with wings?

176
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,160
喔 我每次变形都帅得掉渣！
Ooh, I do transform with an exceptional sense of style.

177
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,350
呃…我把这句话说出口了 是吗？
I said that aloud, didn't I?

178
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,960
威震天不念旧情 想把我干掉
Megatron tried to extinguish my spark in cold blood

179
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,670
还有那个一心想取代我的混蛋毒蜘蛛
then all but replaced me with that traitorous wretch, Airachnid.

180
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,230
她竟然丢下我不管！
She abandoned me

181
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,340
让我自生自灭！
left me for scrap!

182
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,750
所以 干嘛不过河拆桥呢？
So why not rat them out?

183
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,420
没人想把你赶出霸天虎阵营
No one asked you to leave the Decepticon fold.

184
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,530
可我当时并不招人待见！
But I wasn't exactly made to feel welcome at the time.

185
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,760
主人 求您了！
Master, please

186
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,270
再给我一次机会吧 我给您磕头了！
give me one more chance! I beg of you!

187
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,040
对于我痛悔往昔并愿意为您\N奉献一切的心情 您无动于衷
Despite the fact that I had seen the error of my ways and dedicated my spark to you.

188
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,190
我已经认清了自己在宇宙中的位置
I have gained a clear understanding of my place in this universe...

189
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,520
认清了自我 那个自始至终的我
of who I am... of who I was always meant to be.

190
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,340
红蜘蛛 副指挥官
Starscream, second in command

191
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,370
威震天陛下的心腹侍从
humble servant to Lord Megatron.

192
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,410
直到你又有机会推翻我！
Until the next opportunity arises to subvert me.

193
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,710
病人今天状况如何？
And how is the patient doing today?

194
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,080
老样子
Same old.

195
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,540
保持这种植物人状态 真是让他无地自容
An inglorious fate that he should remain in this vegetative state.

196
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,590
正相反 威震天的身体也许成了废铁
On the contrary. Megatron's body may be scrap metal

197
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,630
但他的思维还是很活跃的
but his mind is still percolating.

198
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,180
你自己知道就行了！
Keep that to yourself.

199
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,230
那该死的声波好像有千里眼和顺风耳！
That blasted Soundwave sees and hears everything.

200
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,850
他是霸天虎的耳目嘛
The eyes and ears of the Decepticons.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,870
只要他们的主子一天不醒 他们就是群无头苍蝇
Well, as long as their master remains in limbo, so does their cause.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,500
霸天虎急需一位强悍的 警醒的领袖
The Decepticons deserve a strong, alert leader.

203
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,340
这位领袖也需要一个忠诚的副官
One who would require a loyal second in command.

204
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:42,510
要想坐上副官的位置 必须干得漂亮点 才能让那个“耳目”闭嘴
A candidate would need to earn that post by making a strong case to said eyes and ears.

205
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,540
需要发发慈悲吗 红蜘蛛陛下？
A case for showing mercy, Lord Starscream?

206
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,040
啊哦
Uh-oh.

207
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,820
这机器有快进快退按钮吗？
Does this thing have a fast-forward button

208
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,210
或是删除也行啊！
or better yet, erase?

209
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,690
击倒 麻烦你向声波讲一下 专家的治疗意见
Knockout, if you would be so kind as to provide your expert medical opinion to Soundwave

210
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,390
以便记录在案
for the historical record.

211
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,350
简单来说 如果没有外力协助 威震天会永远保持这种假死状态
Simply put, unaid, Megatron could remain in this deathless slumber forever.

212
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,420
我们的主人不会希望自己成为这个样子
Our master would not have wanted to be seen this way

213
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:18,560
眼看着他的灵魂被禁锢 我们却无所事事 这不公平
to stand idly by while he remains captive in his own body... is not just.

214
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,920
脑电波的活动不能证明他拥有意识
Brain-Wave activity... not evidence of consciousness

215
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,100
只是陷入了无穷的梦境 威震天或许永远都无法醒过来
but merely of an endless dream from which Megatron may never wake.

216
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,540
声波 我们必须面对现实
Soundwave, we must face reality.

217
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,620
我们已经痛失威震天
Megatron is lost to us.

218
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,740
唯一体面的选择 就是让他解脱
The only honorable option would be to show him mercy.

219
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,160
只是拨动一个开关而已
A simple throw of the switch.

220
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,850
等威震天醒来以后
When Megatron comes out of it

221
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,910
就不是把我塞回墙壁里那么简单了！
he'll do more than just stick me back in that wall.

222
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,700
他会把红蜘蛛的脑袋砍下来 还有我的！
He'll have Starscream's head and mine!

223
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,380
不过…如果我在机器关闭之前 就强行拔出接头的话
But... if I disconnect before a proper power-down

224
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,500
连接就会中断
the link is severed and...

225
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,880
老大将永远无法从红蜘蛛的脑中逃脱
the big guy will never emerge from Starscream's head.

226
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,570
这儿…没问题吧？
Everything okay here?

227
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,390
就是看看接头插好没！
Just checking cable integrity.

228
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,270
还有别的事情能拿来评估你的忠诚度吗？
Is it any wonder that I've come to value loyalty above all else?

229
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,490
这个…您知道
Well, you know

230
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
咱们可是霸天虎…
we are Decepticons.

231
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,260
我相信即便是您亲爱的骇翼也并非完美
I'm sure that even your beloved Dreadwing isn't perfect.

232
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,040
人无完人 红蜘蛛
No one is perfect, Starscream

233
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,410
但如同其分离的孪生兄长一般
but like his departed twin

234
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,830
骇翼他懂得荣耀！
Dreadwing understands honor.

235
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,840
苏醒吧 战士
Awaken, warrior.

236
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,860
醒过来 侍奉你的新主人！
Rise and serve your new master!

237
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,990
天震只侍奉一个主人
Skyquake serves only one master.

238
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,530
很好
Excellent.

239
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,910
你的忠诚和奉献精神将成为军队的好榜样
Your loyalty and devotion will set a fine example for the troops.

240
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,130
不必拘谨 天震
No need to be timid, Skyquake.

241
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,390
俯首称臣吧
You may bow.

242
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,450
你没听懂我的话
You fail to grasp my meaning.

243
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,660
派我来这里执行任务的
I am here on a mission 

244
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,990
是我唯一的主人 威震天
assigned to me by my one master... Megatron.

245
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,500
对 他嘛…
Yes... him.

246
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,150
很不幸 威震天已经离我们而去了
Sadly, Megatron is... no longer with us.

247
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,760
不可能！
Impossible.

248
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,240
为什么所有人都难以接受事实？
Why is this so difficult for everyone to accept?

249
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,570
啊 强大的天震葬身于此
Ah, the grave site of the mighty Skyquake.

250
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,210
生前你不假思索地拒绝我的领导
So quick to reject my authority while you lived.

251
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,330
但作为被我复活的第一名战士
But, as the first of my reanimated warriors

252
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,700
你应该听我号令！
you shall bow to my command.

253
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:55,740
是的…黑暗能量之力…是我的了！
Ah! Yes! Power of Dark Energon, be mine!

254
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,800
融为一体 哈哈哈…我感觉到了！
Symbiosis. Hahaha... I can feel it!

255
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,870
他先前不是死去了么？
I understand he perished that day.

256
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,900
嗯…他既非生者亦非亡者
Well, Skyquake is neither living nor dead

257
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,020
现在一定仍在另一重维度空间中游荡着
and no doubt continues to wander through some dimensional neverealm

258
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,500
寻找他的断肢
in search of his missing limb.

259
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,730
你够聪明的话 就别将此事告诉船上的任何人
It would be wise to keep that to yourself around the warship.

260
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
完了…
Awkward.

261
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,290
但…您的意思是…？
B-But, does this mean...

262
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,130
是的 我允许你重回我们的队伍
Yes. I will allow you to return to our ranks

263
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,810
只因这样比与你为敌更为有利！
if only because you are more valuable beside me than against me.

264
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,290
我的个娘啊…感谢火种源！
Oh! Thank the Allspark!

265
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,380
在你缺席期间霸天虎已经因为内讧而四分五裂了
Infighting has nearly destroyed the Decepticons during your absence.

266
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,660
如果我们还想征服塞博特恩就必须团结一致
We must operate as a united front if we are to revive and conquer Cybertron.

267
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,430
所以谁都不可有二心 击倒！
That means each and every one of us, Knockout.

268
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,250
威震天可真是会笼络人心啊…
Megatron sure knows how to patch things up.

269
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,310
对吧…骇…
Eh, Dreadwing?

270
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,770
骇翼？
Dreadwing?
