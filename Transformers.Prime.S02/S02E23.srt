1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,120
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime...

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,050
钛师傅的讯息里还剩下四个加密坐标
Four sets of coordinates from Alpha Trion remain encrypted.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:13,340
我们可以推断出那就是终极之钥的位置
It is logical to conclude that each corresponds to the location of one of the Omega keys.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,840
糟了！
Scrap!

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,960
这个和擎天柱从我手中抢走的一模一样
It appears identical to the one taken from me by Optimus Prime.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,620
或许 这只是拼图中的一块？
Pieces of a larger puzzle, perhaps.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,450
钛师傅说过我们得把四个钥匙都弄到手
Alpha Trion said we need all four keys

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,360
才能让塞博特恩重生 记得吗？
to restore Cybertron, remember?

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,550
我们只要保护好手头上的
We just need to hang on to the one we have

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,980
再想法从威震天那里把剩下的抢过来就行了
find a way to get the others back from Megatron.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,060
最后一个坐标也破解了
The final entry has been decoded.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,910
坐标正在形成一幅图像
The coordinates are forming an image.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,570
这是烟幕？！
Smokescreen?

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,150
擎天柱的新兵是最后一个铁堡遗物？
Prime's latest recruit is the final relic of Iacon!

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,280
不！
No!

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,010
太阳晒屁股啦！
Wakey, wakey.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,980
啥？！
What?!

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,080
你在找相位仪么？谁找到归谁！
If you're looking for your Phase Shifter, finders keepers.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,100
少耍嘴皮子 击倒！
Enough prattling, Knockout!

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,960
把最后一个铁堡遗物交出来 快！
Hand me the final Iacon relic... now.

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,450
唔…这我真的无能为力
Yeah, I can't really help you.

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,080
我只有一个相位仪
That's the only one I was packing.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,290
声波
Soundwave.

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,590
你搞错了 威总
You got the wrong guy, chief.

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,830
擎天柱才是唯一能破译铁堡数据库的人
Optimus Prime's the one who can decode the Iacon database.

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,030
啊…可搞错的人是你
Ah, but you misunderstand.

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,410
最后一个数据已经被我们破解了！
The final entry has been decoded by us!

28
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,900
根据我们的发现
And according to our findings

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,060
显然我手上的人才是“真命天子”
it would appear I do indeed have the right guy.

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,730
问题在于你的身上到底还藏着什么
The question is, what is it that you are still packing?

31
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,150
哇哦 果然腹中有乾坤！
Why, hidden treasure, of course!

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,820
烟幕肯定是被带上霸天虎战舰了！
Smokescreen must have been taken aboard the Decepticon warship.

33
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,480
没法穿透战舰的屏障追踪他的信号
Tracing his signal through its shielding will be impossible.

34
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,840
继续监控所有频道 救护车
Continue monitoring all frequencies, Ratchet.

35
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,980
危在旦夕的不仅仅是烟幕的命运
Far more than Smokescreen's fate may be at stake.

36
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,760
我还是不明白 烟幕怎么会成为终极之钥？
I... don't get it. How could Smoke be an Omega key?

37
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,780
或许他并非钥匙本身 而是装载钥匙的容器？
Perhaps he isn't the key, but its container.

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
其他铁堡遗物是用宇宙舱送来的
The other Iacon relics were sent to Earth in pods.

39
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,610
为何独此与众不同？
Why not this one?

40
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,180
或许当霸天虎洗劫铁堡时
When the Decepticons stormed Iacon

41
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,510
钛师傅已来不及将最后一个钥匙送入太空了
it may have been too late for Alpha Trion

42
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,440
钛师傅已来不及将最后一个钥匙送入太空了
to launch the final Omega key into space...

43
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,440

to launch the final Omega key into space...

44
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,170
…至少常规方法已经行不通了
at least, by standard means.

45
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,790
那么当烟幕昏迷时 他以为是被霸天虎打的
So Smokescreen assumed everything went black because he was hit by Decepticons.

46
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,930
但实际上那是钛师傅所为
But Alpha Trion's the one who actually turned out the kid's lights.

47
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,330
考虑到我的导师担心烟幕\N被敌人俘获而向他隐瞒事实
It stands to reason that my mentor did not want Smokescreen to know

48
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,660
…这事合情合理
what he was carrying in the event of capture.

49
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,280
既然遗物是活动的
And with a mobile relic

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,990
钛师傅自然无法提供确切的坐标
Alpha Trion couldn't possibly supply fixed coordinates.

51
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,960
于是钛大爷转而扔给我们一个线索 烟仔的大头照！
So the big "A" slipped us a clue instead... Smoke's mug shot.

52
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,740
但霸天虎抢先抓走了烟幕
But the Decepticons got to Smokescreen first.

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,190
恐怕他们也破解了同一个线索
I fear they have decoded the same clue.

54
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,930
又是一个一模一样的遗物？
Yet another of these identical relics?

55
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,520
快把它取出来！
Remove it swiftly.

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,500
乐意效劳
With pleasure.

57
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,400
人家一向讨厌比我还闪亮的漆面
I do so resent a finish flashier than my own.

58
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,690
哈 吓着你了吧！
Ha! Made you squirm.

59
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,910
梦幻般的效果…
Trippy.

60
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,800
…还可随意操控
And intuitive.

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,150
适当的接地功能 能防止使用者陷入地板
Proper grounding ensures that its user won't phase through the floor.

62
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,980
我让你快点！
I said swiftly.

63
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,550
啊 啊 把你的脏手拿开！
Ah. Ah. Get your stinkin' hand out of my gears!

64
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,210
嗯…这不是…拿到啦！
Mm, and... gotcha!

65
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,310
告诉我这些遗物作何用途！
Tell me the function of these relics.

66
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,920
门钩？刮胡刀？首饰？这可难住我了
Doorstops? Shavers? Bling? Beats me.

67
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,570
哼 可惜这小玩意儿不能让我探进他的大脑
Hmm. A pity this little gadget won't allow me to just reach into his brain pan and

68
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,410
把那些情报一把拽出来
pluck out the info.

69
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,700
幸运的是 我们拥有这样的设备
Fortunately, we possess a device that can.

70
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,590
尽管单个终极之钥毫无用处
Individually, each of these so-called Omega keys is useless.

71
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,440
但这仍能大大增加我的谈判筹码
Yet possessing even a single one grants me tremendous negotiating power

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,110
不管对方是汽车人还是霸天虎
with either Autobots or Decepticons.

73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,120
不过 想像一下我成功得到其他三个的话…
Still, imagine if I manage to acquire the other three.

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,890
我可以让塞博特恩重生！\N并以“红蜘蛛一世”之名称帝…
I could revive Cybertron and seize the throne as Starscream the first.

75
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,340
至高无上的霸主！破坏大帝！
Supreme overlord and emperor of destruction!

76
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,420
可我不像威震天
But unlike Megatron

77
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,180
我没有建立这种强权统治的基础条件
I lack the necessary infrastructure to enforce such a reign.

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,630
没有战舰 没有军队 只有这破实验室里的东西
No warship, no army... only my meager laboratory finds

79
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,550
一个环陆桥的遥控开关 最后一剂红色能量液
a ground-bridge remote control, a single remaining dose of Red Energon

80
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,420
还有你 老朋友…
and you, old friend.

81
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,150
不过 我很乐意用这东西做笔交易
But I would all too gladly trade this

82
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,200
只为恢复以往的荣耀…
simply to be restored to my former glory.

83
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,760
我并未听说过这些终极之钥
While I am unfamiliar with the lore of these Omega keys

84
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,620
但钛师傅知道很多秘密
Alpha Trion knew many secrets

85
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,060
我们的先祖拥有许多神奇的科技
and the ancients possessed technology

86
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,340
在我们的现代科学中早已失传
that has long been lost to what we consider modern science.

87
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,220
尽管还不清楚功能和原理 但有一件事可以确定
Whatever their function, this much is certain.

88
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,320
那就是只有集齐四枚终极之钥 才能让塞博特恩复苏
We cannot restore Cybertron without all four Omega keys in our possession.

89
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,190
故乡的未来就指望它了！
The future of our home world depends on it.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,300
观影结束
That's a wrap.

91
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,210
可以依我意愿…再造塞博特恩的力量…
The power to remake Cybertron as I see fit.

92
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,160
我会杀了擎天柱 夺回另外两枚钥匙
I will pry the other two keys from Optimus Prime's lifeless fingers.

93
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,790
我们必须找到汽车人基地的确切位置
We must find the exact location of the Autobot base.

94
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,490
必要的话 把烟幕的脑子撬开都行
Patch in and tear apart Smokescreen's mind, if you must.

95
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,500
由我来？
Me?

96
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,900
你说呢？
Who else?

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,330
你以为我会把护送钥匙的重任交付给你吗？
Do you think I would entrust you to see this key safely to the vault containing the other one?

98
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,780
呼…还是继续撬脑壳吧
Once more, into the brain pan.

99
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,810
不！别来了！别动我的脑袋！
No! Not again! Stay out of my head!

100
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,460
安分点儿 乱动只会让你的情况更糟
Now, now. You'll only make things worse for yourself.

101
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,320
更糟？怎么个糟法？
Worse how?

102
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,100
有一套啊 你这小滑头
Well, aren't you the clever one?

103
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,110
这艘船在万里高空之上 船上遍布霸天虎
This is ship is miles in the sky and swarming with Decepticons!

104
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,570
你真的以为自己可以逃脱？
Do you really think you can escape?

105
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,870
谁说我要逃了？
Who says I'm lookin' to escape?

106
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,600
灵机一动！
Think fast!

107
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,130
什么？！
What?!

108
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,090
出口不在这边儿？
Oh, this isn't the way out?

109
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,660
交出钥匙！
The keys.

110
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,030
可惜你不会飞
A pity you are incapable of flight.

111
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,330
切 好像我会怕似的？
Yeah, like I'm gonna let that stop me.

112
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,980
烟幕的信号又出现了！
Smokescreen's signal, it's back online!

113
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,720
这小子逃出了战舰！
The kid escaped the warship!

114
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,000
烟幕呼叫基地 我非常需要环陆桥！
Smokescreen to base. I could really use a ground bridge.

115
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,190
快去抢终极之钥 快！
Retrieve the Omega keys! Quickly!

116
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,840
会飞的！我需要会飞的！
Fliers! I need fliers!

117
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,370
设定坐标 怪了…
Setting coordinates. Strange.

118
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,920
有什么问题？
What's the problem?

119
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,000
烟幕的遥测数据不对劲
Smokescreen's telemetry data doesn't make sense.

120
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,940
我无法锁定他的位置！
I can't lock onto his position.

121
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,910
我发现问题所在了
I've isolated the problem.

122
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,220
烟幕正在自由落体！
Smokescreen is in free fall.

123
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,470
烟幕 我要在你的正下方开启环陆桥！
Smokescreen, I'm opening the ground bridge directly below you.

124
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,820
各位留神 我马上要进来了
Brace yourselves. I'm gonna make an entrance.

125
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,930
他…偏离路线了！
He's... off course.

126
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,420
你算偏了？
You missed?

127
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,350
再开一个 快！
Open another one... fast!

128
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,240
希望这接地功能 对实际地面不起作用！
I hope proper grounding on this thing doesn't apply to actual ground.

129
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,780
不！
No!

130
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,320
检查所有残骸！
Scour the wreckage!

131
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,430
把钥匙给老子找出来！
I want those keys!

132
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,980
嘿 救护车？
Hey, Ratchet.

133
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,000
我还是需要环陆桥！
I could still really use that ground bridge.

134
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,780
我早说了吧？
Did I tell you?

135
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,700
宿命！钛师傅知道我能保护好它！
Destiny! Alpha Trion knew I'd keep it safe.

136
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,090
干得不错 后生！
Nice work, kid.

137
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,670
威震天那儿就这一把钥匙
It was the only key in Megatron's vault.

138
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,920
那么现在有三枚钥匙了
Then three keys are accounted for.

139
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,440
第四枚仍在虎子战舰上的某处
Then the fourth is still somewhere on the Cons' warship.

140
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,960
除非…威震天一开始就没拿到那一个？
Unless... Megatron never had it to begin with?

141
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,290
高频信号
A high-frequency signal...

142
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,740
隐藏着一条信息
with an embedded message.

143
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,810
是红蜘蛛
Starscream.

144
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,820
我捡到了一个你们很想要的东西
"I have obtained something of interest to you

145
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,780
但似乎对我来说用处不大
which seems to be of no practical use to me".

146
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,780
肯定是终极之钥！
It's got to be the Omega key!

147
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,590
他就是打我闷棍的那混蛋！
He's the one who blindsided me!

148
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,580
除此之外别无可能
What else could Scream be referring to?

149
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,620
还有呢！带上医药箱
Ep, ep! There's more. "Bring medical kit.

150
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,700
作为交换 我只要求为我进行一次变形齿轮移植手术
I only ask for the surgical replacement of my T-Cog in return."

151
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,980
哈！说得好像我们会把他的翅膀还给他！
Heh! Like we're gonna give scream back his wings.

152
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,910
没有那把钥匙 塞博特恩将永无生机
Without the missing key, Cybertron will remain devoid of life.

153
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,560
我知道 这是破天荒的机会 但那可能是个圈套
Broken record, I know, but... it could be a trick.

154
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,890
红蜘蛛可能还不知道
It is possible that Starscream does not yet realize

155
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,180
所持之物的重大意义
the significance of what he holds.

156
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,180
而且我们也知道他很久不能飞了
And we do know that he's been incapable of flight for some time.

157
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,960
事关重大 我们必须考虑红蜘蛛的要求
The stakes are too great for us not to consider Starscream's proposal.

158
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,630
尽管如此 我们仍须小心戒备
However, we will take precautions.

159
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,130
在那儿！
There.

160
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,920
红蜘蛛？交出终极之钥
Starscream, show us the Omega key.

161
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,630
放弃吧 小红！
Give it up, Scream.

162
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,970
哈？
Huh?

163
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,170
太迟了
We're too late.

164
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,360
变形齿轮也帮不了他了
The T-Cog won't help him now.

165
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,420
看来这地儿现在由我做主
It would seem I have the run of the place.

166
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,410
哦…现在掏出你的心是多么容易啊！
Oh, how easy it would be to gut you.

167
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,460
干掉你们所有人！
To gut all of you.

168
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,060
可惜 本座另有要事…
But... first thing's first.

169
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,820
擎天柱把钥匙都放哪儿了？
Where does Optimus keep his key ring?

170
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,510
不在这儿 不在 不在
Not here. Nope. No.

171
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,840
我还在想那个婊子上哪儿去了呢
Bleh, I was wondering what happened to that wretch.

172
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,940
啊 这些人是不是以为我很闲！
Ah! Do they think I have all day?

173
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,250
啊 在这儿呐！
Ah, there you are.

174
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,050
奇怪 红蜘蛛死了有段时间了…
Curious. Starscream has been deceased for quite some time.

175
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,280
那怎么可能？他才刚给咱们发了消息啊
Well, how's that possible if he just sent us a message?

176
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,200
我们中计了！
We have been deceived.

177
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,090
喔哦 这是怎么了？
Whoa! Whoa! What was that?

178
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,200
阿尔茜 关掉环陆桥！
Arcee, close the ground bridge now.

179
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,710
现在我拿到了你们的小玩意儿
Now that I have your trinkets

180
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,670
我终于有空刮花你的…
I'm free to enjoy slitting your...

181
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,730
哼 可惜本座得赶时间…
But, as I appear to be pressed for time...

182
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,330
汽――车――人――
Autobots.

183
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,960
原――地――驻――守――
Maintain positions!

184
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,780
抱歉 你说什么？
I'm sorry. What was that?

185
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,220
呜哇哦哇…
Wo.. oh... woo... oh...

186
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
你们汽车人总以为自己多么优越
You Autobots think you're so superior

187
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,600
可实际上呢？
but do you know what you really are?

188
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,090
迟钝！
Slow!

189
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,290
红色能量耗尽了 是不？
The red energon wore off, didn't it?

190
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,680
他拿着终极之钥！
He has the Omega keys!

191
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,110
快点儿！
Come on!

192
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,770
不――！！！
No!!!

193
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,210
我们会抓住他的
We'll get them back.

194
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,190
钥匙对红蜘蛛一点用也没有
The keys can be of no use to Starscream

195
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,030
他不过是像吸屑虫一样见什么咬什么！
while he scrounges in the wild like some scraplet.

196
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,540
我们肯定能拿什么东西和他交换！
There must be something that we can offer him in exchange.

197
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,220
无论红蜘蛛有何企图
The fate of Cybertron now rests in Starscream's hands...

198
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,320
塞博特恩的命运都掌握在他手中了
Whatever his intention.

199
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,400
求您了 陛下
I beg you, my liege

200
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,150
请将我从这窘境中解脱出来吧！
release me from this absurd predicament!

201
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,440
不！你正好给那些胆敢让我失望之人
No! You shall serve as a constant reminder to those who dare

202
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,670
做个警示！
fail me.

203
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,520
我不能允许擎天柱成为塞博特恩的救世主！
I cannot allow Optimus Prime to be the one to revive Cybertron.

204
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,870
我们一定要找到汽车人基地 然后进攻 夺回终极之钥！
We will locate the Autobot base, invade it, and retrieve the Omega keys.

205
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,490
我已经去过了 且大功告成
Been there... done that.

206
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,200
请原谅我的不请自来 威震天陛下
Please pardon my unannounced visit, lord Megatron.

207
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,510
小人有礼物敬呈于您…
But I have come bearing a peace offering.
