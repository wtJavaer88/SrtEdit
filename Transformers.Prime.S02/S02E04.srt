1
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,930
威震天？
Megatron?

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,740
看来你侦测到的远古汽车人信号是准确的
It seems you've detected the ancient Autobot frequency precisely because it was unearthed.

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,740
他们已经把东西挖出来了
 

4
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,430
没关系 我们的后援快到了
Well, our backup shouldn't be far behind.

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,440
在不知道霸天虎挖出何物的情况下
Without knowing what the Decepticons have exhumed

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,280
我不愿意再等下去了
I do not think I am willing to wait.

7
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,010
给我看看
Show me.

8
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,700
拿过来给我 千万小心！
Bring it to me. With utmost care!

9
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,740
威震天
Megatron!

10
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,720
我不允许你窃取汽车人的遗产
I cannot allow you to pilfer Autobot relics.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,410
你颠倒了黑白 擎天柱
Not only are you misinformed, Optimus.

12
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,130
另外我建议你放下武器
But I would strongly advise you to lower your weapons.

13
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,400
除非你想跟我同归于尽
Unless you're in the mood for mutually assured destruction.

14
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,290
这不可能
It can't be!

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,220
火种剥离器…
The Spark-Extractor.

16
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,630
其貌不扬…
Rather unassuming...

17
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,590
却能将它作用范围内的火种尽数吸走
yet capable of extracting every Spark within its radius.

18
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,400
再想到是你引领我得到它的… 擎天柱
And to think that you led me straight to it, Optimus!

19
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,250
噢…或者我应该说 是奥利安・派克斯
Or should I say, Orion Pax did.

20
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,280
你真应该好好留着你的霸天虎标志
You really should have left your Decepticon shield intact.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:47,720
你根本想不到 在我们短暂的蜜月里 你的密码破译技术帮了多大的忙
For you have no idea how useful your code-breaking skills proved to be, during our all too brief time together.

22
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,020
声波 打开环陆桥！
Soundwave! Send the Groundbridge.

23
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,490
消灭他们！
Engage them!

24
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,050
大黄蜂 夺回火种剥离器！
Bumblebee! Secure the package.

25
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,350
什么？！
What?!

26
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,980
特技不错嘛 哈
Loop-de-loop, hah.

27
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,010
你的漆蹭掉啦 大黄蜂
You have some brass bearings, Bumblebee.

28
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,890
擎天柱
Optimus

29
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,180
这儿
here.

30
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,210
这是我们探测到的古老频率的来源
The source of the ancient frequency we detected.

31
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,650
是铁堡所用的定位信号
An Iacon homing beacon.

32
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,210
这上面为什么会有汽车人的定位器？
What's an Autobot locator doing on THAT?

33
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,320
战时收缴的霸天虎A级兵器 都被封存在铁堡的地下室里
The class "A" Decepticon weapons confiscated during the War were sealed within the vaults below Iacon.

34
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,820
就是你曾担任档案员的地方
Where once you worked as an archivist.

35
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,050
铁堡不仅是文化中心 还是战时要塞
Iacon was both a cultural center and a stronghold.

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,230
在汽车人萎靡不振之际 威震天袭击了铁堡
Which Megatron raided when Autobot troops were at their nadir.

37
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,660
考虑到铁堡可能沦陷 明智的选择是
It stands to reason that in anticipation of Iacon being overrun by enemy forces

38
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,810
遗弃这些武器 以免落入霸天虎之手
these weapons were jettisoned off-world to keep them far from Decepticon reach.

39
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,570
显然 这个定位信号
Clearly, the beacon was added as a safety measure

40
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,870
是这些武器被敌方发现时的防范手段
should the weapons ever be found by the undesired party.

41
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,130
多亏了我们的特技小子 这一个被我们收回了
Well, thanks to our hot-shot stunt driver this one is going in our vault.

42
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,000
你觉得威震天从你那里得到的情报是否只有这些？
Do you think this is the only intel you supplied to Megatron?

43
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,800
阿尔茜 你问的很对
Arcee, you are right to ask.

44
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,040
可惜的是我…不记得了
And I am afraid I... do not remember.

45
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,110
擎天柱
Optimus.

46
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,810
威震天确实在你失忆时利用了你
Megatron clearly took advantage of your amnesia.

47
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,470
但就我们目前所知 只有这个火种剥离器而已
But for all we know this Spark-extractor is the extent of it.

48
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:51,150
他向你暗示还有其他东西 也许只是为了扰乱你的判断
Have you stopped to consider that he might have suggested otherwise merely to plague your thoughts?

49
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,510
火种剥离器原本已经到手了！
The Spark-extractor was in my grasp!

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,320
当初真应该杀了那个侦察兵
I should have removed more than that scout's voice-box

51
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,290
而不是只毁掉他的发声器！
when I had the chance!

52
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,150
没错 声波
Indeed, Soundwave.

53
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,220
奥利安走之前留下的坐标还有两个
We possess two more sets of coordinates which Orion decrypted before departing our ranks.

54
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:21,650
看看我们还能找到哪些失落已久的宝藏
Let us see what other long lost treasures we might be re-united with.

55
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,730
是的 我刚刚收到了相同的信号
Yeah. I just picked up the same signal.

56
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,210
可能又是一个定位信号
Could be another homing beacon.

57
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,270
我们在坐标处集合
Let's rendezvous at the coordinates.

58
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,680
塞拉斯 另有一个目标在向我们靠近
Silas. Another one's headed to our position.

59
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,540
预计…两分钟后抵达
Estimated arrival - two minutes.

60
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,700
加快动作
Work briskly.

61
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,660
原来这信号是个陷阱
It would appear the signal was a trap.

62
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,560
还好是大黄蜂 不是我
Better Bumblebee than me.

63
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,790
支援部队提前到了
The backup is ahead of schedule.

64
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,710
还算走运
As luck would have it

65
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,690
我干完了
so am I.

66
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,200
收队
Move out.

67
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
小蜂！
Bee!

68
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,560
这是谁干的？虎子？！
Who did this? 'Cons?!

69
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,670
我们追上去就知道了 快走！
One way to find out. Come on!

70
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,510
到底走不走啊？！
We rolling’ or not?!

71
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,190
你不能？什么意思？
What do you mean, "you can't"?

72
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
你一定能修好小蜂的 是吧？
You can fix Bee, can't you?

73
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,890
大黄蜂伤得很重
Bumblebee was hit pretty hard.

74
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,330
震荡射线可能击穿了他的变形齿轮
The stun blast may have fried his T-cog.

75
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,840
那是一种变形关节吗？
Is that like a T-bone?

76
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,970
不完全是
Not exactly.

77
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,610
是我们用来扫描车辆和变形的器官
It's the organ that allows us to scan vehicles and transform.

78
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,580
火种源在上！
By the Allspark!

79
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,670
大黄蜂的变形齿轮不是损坏
Bumblebee's T-cog isn't damaged.

80
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,030
而是不见了！
It's missing!

81
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,680
但霸天虎也会变形
But the Decepticons transform too.

82
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,040
他们偷它干什么呢？
Why would they steal that?

83
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,710
虽然威震天唤醒过僵尸 但他不会偷器官
Megatron may be known to raise zombies but he is no ghoul.

84
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,840
如果不是威震天干的 会是谁呢？
If Megatron wasn't behind this then who was?

85
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,010
把打击拆掉的那群人
The ones who cannibalized Breakdown.

86
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,840
他们还想挖出我的心
And tried to gut me!

87
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,220
机械党
M.E.C.H.

88
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,400
看来他们对塞博特恩人的生理机能更精通了
And it would appear their knowledge of Cybertronian bio-tech has grown more sophisticated.

89
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,930
可是 为什么他们要大黄蜂的零件？
But why would they want Bumblebee's part?

90
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,110
大黄蜂 别
Bumblebee, please.

91
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,240
以你目前的状况无法胜任
You are not presently equipped to handle this.

92
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,810
你误会了 我的朋友
You are mistaken, my friend.

93
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,660
我当然可以体会失去自身重要部分的痛楚
I do know what it's like to lose a vital part of oneself.

94
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,690
也正因此
And, as a result

95
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,740
我更懂得要信赖自己的团队
I know the value of putting one's faith in the strength of those around you.

96
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,070
我们发誓会竭尽全力让你完好如初
We vow to do everything in our power to make you whole again.

97
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,660
就算不能 救护车也会为你量身打造一个新…
And if not, Ratchet can just make you a new...

98
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,200
…什么齿轮来着？
cog-thing. Right?

99
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,990
我说错什么了？
What did I say?

100
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,850
神子! 变形齿轮是生理器官 不是随处可见的旧零件
Miko! A T-cog is a bio-mechanism, not a scrap-yard find.

101
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,220
如果像你想的那么容易
If it were that easy don't you think

102
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,240
我不早就给大黄蜂换上新的发声器了吗？
I would have replaced Bumblebee's voice-box by now?

103
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,840
你不是一无是处 小蜂！
You are not useless, Bee.

104
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,450
好吧 好吧
All right all right

105
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,210
我们在大黄蜂的部件找到之前都不变形
I say none of us transform until Bumblebee gets his cog back.

106
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,430
你的心肠很好 隔板
Your spark’s in the right place, Bulkhead.

107
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,500
但现在可不是自缚手脚的时候
But I don't think now was the time to be limiting ourselves.

108
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,800
尤其是在威震天搜寻可以毁灭世界的装置之时
Not with Megatron potentially seeking other Doomsday devices.

109
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,550
而我还担心机械党在利用大黄蜂的变形齿轮
And I fear not while MECH uses Bumblebee's T-cog

110
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,480
干他们不可告人的勾当
for their own sinister purpose.

111
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,310
开始第二阶段测试
Commence beta-test.

112
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,610
安装成功 开始扫描
Installation complete. Commencing scan.

113
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,900
扫描成功
Scan successful.

114
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,520
开始变形
Commencing transformation.

115
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,950
就是你们拆了倒霉的打击 并把他变成了可怜的科学实验品？
You are the ones who turned poor Breakdown into a pitiful science experiment?

116
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,800
没从实验中得到你们想要的吧？
Didn't learn much from the experience, did you?

117
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,380
这足以知道你的弱点在哪儿了 霸天虎
Enough to know where the soft spots are, Decepticon.

118
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,990
拜托 我已经不属于那个阵营了
Oh please. I am no longer affiliated with that entity.

119
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,640
再说 如果我是来替大块头寻仇的
Besides, if I were here to avenge the big lug

120
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,390
你早就跪地求饶了
you would be screaming for mercy by now.

121
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,000
你来这儿做什么？
Why are you here?

122
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,740
来与你们结盟
To propose an alliance.

123
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,620
你看 我们之间的共同点比你想象的要多
You see, we have much more in common than you might think.

124
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,660
我说的可不只是身上的伤痕
And I am not merely referring to our battle scars.

125
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,830
那么 这场交易能带给我什么好处？
What could I possibly gain from such an arrangement?

126
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,470
业内知识
Insider knowledge.

127
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,830
明智的选择
Wise choice.

128
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,130
变形齿轮不是技术产品 而是生理器官
Now. A T-cog isn't technology. It is biology.

129
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,110
这意味着它排斥一切能源 除了能量体
Which means it will reject any power source other than energon.

130
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,140
接着说
Go on.

131
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,370
能量体就是燃料
Energon is the fuel

132
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,950
是所有塞博特恩人的弹药和生命源泉
the ammunition and the lifeblood of all Cybertronians

133
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,260
无论他们是哪个阵营
whatever their affiliation.

134
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,290
你们和我都想得到它
You and I both want it.

135
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,800
现在我缺少定位它的手段
And currently I lack the means of locating it.

136
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,770
不过 只要我向你提供…
But once I supply you with the...

137
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,220
其独特的化学构成
particulars of its chemical make-up...

138
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,010
我们就能利用你手头的资源
we can utilise your considerable resources

139
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,210
探测出新的能量矿藏
to devise a means of detecting new deposits.

140
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,350
供我们同享
For us to share.

141
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,480
前提是这个供应能满足机械党的大量需求
IF the supply meets M.E.C.H.'s rather significant demand.

142
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,100
啊哈…想建立一支军队 是吧？
Aah... Intending to build an army, are you?

143
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,530
我对这样的野心可一点都不陌生
I am no stranger to ambition.

144
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,340
擎天柱和隔板暂时还没报告
Optimus and Bulkhead haven't reported in yet.

145
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,510
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

146
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,600
有消息我会告诉你的！
I will let you know the moment I hear something.

147
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,080
看在原始天尊的份上!
Oh for Primus' sake!

148
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,400
谁来给他找点事儿干 好让我专心工作？
Will someone keep him occupied so I can get some work done?!!

149
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,640
嘿 小蜂
Hey, Bee.

150
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,320
来把游戏怎么样？
How about a videogame?

151
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,280
不合时宜
Bad call.

152
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,150
对不起
Sorry.

153
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,510
嘿 不要紧
Hey, no big deal!

154
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,060
反正这游戏也很烂
That game is lame.

155
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,000
看看电视怎么样？
What do you say we watch some TV?

156
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,150
新款厄巴纳500 不仅仅会震撼你的世界
The new Urbana 500. It won't just rock your world.

157
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,980
还会改变你的世界
It will transform it.

158
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,760
汽车人没了汽车还真是糟糕
Taking the "auto-" out of an Autobot is so not a good thing.

159
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,810
小蜂 别这样 你没轮子也一样耀眼
Bee, c'mon! You're just as amazing without wheels!

160
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,740
我的意思是 速度不代表一切
I mean, speed isn't everything.

161
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,850
个人最佳纪录 阿尔茜！
Personal best, Arcee!

162
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,730
轻松打破1分20秒！
You hit 1:20 easy.

163
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,540
啊哦…
Uh-oh.

164
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,590
大黄蜂！你去哪儿？
Bumblebee! Where do you think you're going?

165
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,820
你不能就这样随便出去散步！
You can't just go for a walk!

166
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,940
我们是隐蔽行动的机器人！
We are robots in disguise.

167
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,200
离开基地会将你置于险境
Leaving the base in this form puts you at risk of being seen

168
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,160
而且暴露我们的行踪
and of us being discovered.

169
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,090
你就呆在这儿 直到…
You''ll just have to remain in the silo until...

170
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,520
是的 大黄蜂 直到我能把你治好
... yes, Bumblebee. Until I can fix you.

171
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,850
上车 走人
In you go.

172
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,370
谢谢你接我回家
Thanks for the lift home

173
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,950
杰克的妈妈 在…在医院里做护士
friend of Jack's Mom who is a nurse at... at... the hospital!

174
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,480
其他人呢？
Where are the others?

175
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,790
杰克在打工
Jack's at work.

176
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,520
神子又留堂了
Miko's in detention... again.

177
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,660
我还以为隔板会来
I was expecting Bulkhead.

178
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,530
好吧 很抱歉让你失望了 不过他在执行任务
Well, I’m sorry to disappoint but he is on watch duty.

179
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
想试试警笛开道么？
You want to ride with the siren on?

180
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,670
不 谢了
No, thank you.

181
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,070
应该没错 我要通知其他人
This could be it. I'll alert the others.

182
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,710
我知道你能胜任
I know you and I can handle it

183
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,040
不过 小蜂 没理由…
Bee, but there is no reason to...

184
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,760
你想证明什么？
What are you trying to prove?

185
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,990
救护车
Ratchet.

186
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,560
大黄蜂的发声器是怎么回事？
What happened to Bumblebee's voice-box?

187
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,950
是在战斗中 严重受损
It was... severely damaged in battle.

188
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
怎么搞的？
How?

189
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,680
你觉得呢？
How do you think?

190
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,220
当然很惨
Tragically, of course.

191
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,730
这发生在和平圣坛
It happened at Tyger-Pax.

192
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,340
（Tyger Pax 和平圣坛 代表生命的圣坛 真人电影中设定为供奉火种源的神坛)
Our brave scout was captured by Megatron's forces and interrogated.

193
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,910
不过他没有透露任何情报
But he refused to provide intel.

194
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,470
为此付出了惨重代价
And paid a grave price for his courage.

195
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,270
大黄蜂几乎成为了一堆废铁
Bumblebee was left for scrap.

196
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,890
不过汽车人部队找到了他 并送进了救护站
But Autobot troops found him and evacuated him to a triage facility.

197
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,190
一个战地医生稳住了他的伤势
Where a field medic managed to stabilize his condition.

198
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,040
所以 大黄蜂的性命多亏了那位战地医生？
So, we owe Bumblebee's life to that field medic?

199
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,200
从某个角度来说可以这么认为
That's one way of looking at it, I suppose.

200
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,210
不过那个医生…本可以做得更好
Though the medic... could have done better.

201
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,550
安全
Clear.

202
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,500
天晓得我怎么会帮你这么干
I still don't know how you talked me into this.

203
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,140
你比神子还不安分
You're worse than Miko.

204
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,140
好好好 我知道
Yeah-yeah-yeah, I know.

205
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,840
不是每次任务都需要高速追击
Not every mission ends in a high-speed pursuit

206
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,140
但你要是不能…
but without your...

207
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,270
好 我不说了
Fine. I'll drop it.

208
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,150
不过如果擎天柱发现了 别说这是我的主意
But if Optimus finds out, this was not my idea.

209
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,660
信号来源就是那儿
Signal's coming from over there.

210
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,660
正朝我们过来 还很快
And it's coming our way, fast!

211
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,260
有本事就来抓我啊！
Catch me if you can!

212
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,430
我去抓住他！
I'll get him!

213
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,040
好吧 你去！
Okay. You get him!

214
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,230
你在锻炼身体么？
Sporting of you?

215
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,710
不准备打爆我的轮胎么？
You're not even gotta try and shoot up my tires?

216
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,370
大黄蜂 你那传说中的马力呢？
Bumblebee! Where is your famous horse-power?

217
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,790
让我看看你的速度！
Show me some speed!

218
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,030
那个老爷车是啥情况？
What is with the rent-a-car?!

219
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,250
我也想陪你套会儿圈圈…
I'd stick around and do some doughnuts around you...

220
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,470
不过我现在有货要送
But I have a delivery to make.
