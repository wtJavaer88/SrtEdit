1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,010
在上一集中
Previously on Transformers Prime:

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,660
隔板 准备出发
Bulkhead, prepare for departure.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,730
拉斐尔和福勒探员负责联络和进行传送
Rafael and agent Fowler will be your communication and transportation hub.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,320
谁是你们中的最强者？
Who is fiercest among you?

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,590
我是硬壳
I am Hardshell.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,020
你要去替我拿回一样东西 毒能
You will retrieve something for me: Tox-en.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,510
你带着它走？那东西不是有毒吗？
You are carrying it? I thought that stuff was toxic.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,440
你的火种是我的了 救援队小子！
Your spark is mine, Wrecker!

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,280
就是这样 大兵 回家吧
That's right, soldier. Come on home!

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,750
救援队小子留了我一条命
The Wrecker let me alive.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,480
这是致命的错误
The last mistake he will ever make.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,470
不…
No!

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,220
我们拿到了相位仪 还刮花了击倒的脸… 噢耶！
We got the Phase shifter, and we messed up Knock Out's face... Oh yeah!

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,820
嘿！
Hey!

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,340
让我猜猜 你和拉夫在驾车时听首席音调
Let me guess, you and Raf spend all your drive time listening to chip tunes.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,430
好吧 那很有趣
Well, its been fun

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,100
不过我已经准备好回到老搭档隔板的身边…啊！
but I'm ready to get back to my regularly scheduled partner, Bulkhea... Ah!!!

18
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,470
隔板 回答我！
Bulkhead respond!

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,020
隔板？
Bulkhead?

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,200
隔板？
Bulkhead?

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,060
发生了什么事？
What happened?

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,450
暴露在有毒物质中
Tox-en exposure, among other things

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,070
隔板的系统全面故障
Bulkhead had suffered a complete systems failure.

24
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,200
等等 毒物 还有？
Hold on, toxic-en?

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,240
帮我把他扶进医疗舱 快！
Help me get him into the medical bay, now!

26
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,170
不！
No!

27
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,510
如果我没有去纽约的话…
If I hadn't gone to New York.

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,990
这与你无关
There's nothing you could have done.

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,280
是那个硬壳在背后放的冷枪
Hardshell sucker-punched the big lug while he was down.

30
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,360
谁？
Who?

31
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,980
某只机器昆虫 不过那不是重点
Some Insecticon, it doesn't matter.

32
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,400
重点是这不是你的错 明白了？
Point is, it's not your fault. You got that?

33
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,660
明白了
Got it.

34
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,790
这怎么可能？
How is this possible?

35
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,870
四个遗物本该唾手可得
Four relics, each within our grasp.

36
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,120
只有声波有所交代 而其他人只有借口
And yet, only Soundwave has return with something other than excuse!

37
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,450
告诉我硬壳 你的是什么？
Tell me, Hardshell. What is yours?!

38
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,570
我没有借口 陛下 我没能找回毒能
I have none, my lord. We failed to retrieve the Tox-En.

39
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,830
不过那个绿色的汽车人已被摧毁
But the green Autobot has been... terminated.

40
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,690
那么这次并非一无所获
Then perhaps this day is not lost after all.

41
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,440
如果属实 那真是很久都没人熄灭过汽车人的火种了
If that is true. It has been a while since anyone has extinguished an Autobot's Spark.

42
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,540
那是因为机器昆虫已经很久未得到机会去一试身手了
Because it has been a while since an Insecticon warrior has been provided the opportunity to do so.

43
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,500
真的假的？\N我指挥的那些虫子可都是些酒囊饭袋
Really now? Because the bug under my recent command was utterly useless.

44
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,540
够了！
Enough!

45
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,210
硬壳 你确定那个叫隔板的已经被摧毁了？
Hardshell, are you certain the one called Bulkhead was exterminated?

46
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,310
我亲手所为 威震天陛下
By my very own hand, lord Megatron.

47
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,740
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,910
原来是你们在纽约的冒险被安保摄像机拍下来了
Turns out, highlights of your Big Apple adventure got caught on security tape.

49
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,990
五角大楼让我去收拾残局
The Pentagon needs me to run interference with the Mayor.

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,730
我想留下 但是…
I tried to stall, but...

51
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,270
去你需要去的地方 福勒探员
Go where you are needed, Agent Fowler.

52
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,670
现在你对隔板无能为力
There is nothing more you can do for Bulkhead at this time.

53
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,580
保持联络 擎天柱
Keep me posted, Prime.

54
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,140
我说真的
I mean it.

55
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,550
千斤顶正在路上
Wheeljack's on his way.

56
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,340
我真不敢相信你们已经放弃隔板了！
I can't believe you're giving up on Bulkhead already!

57
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,070
我只是觉得千斤顶和隔板关系很好
All I meant was Wheeljack and Bulkhead are close.

58
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,720
我认为他想来这儿
I thought he'd want to be here.

59
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,500
我知道你的意思
I know what you meant.

60
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,580
神子 你要去哪里？
Miko, where are you going?

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,920
回家！好吧 趁福勒探员还能让我搭个便车
Home! While Agent Fowler can still give me a lift.

62
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,250
她需要时间
She needs time.

63
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,060
隔板现在情况稳定
Bulkhead is stable, for the moment

64
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,020
不过他需要静养
but I've had to induce stasis.

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,100
伤情如何 大夫？
What's the damage, Doc?

66
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,140
隔板的中枢神经系统损伤严重
Bulkhead suffered massive trauma to his central neural conduit.

67
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,330
那什么还在工作呢 这方面你是专家
I've watched you work, you're a maestro.

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,880
与毒气接触 使他最微小的系统也大面积停机
The Tox-En exposure has caused system-wide shutdown on a sub-micronic level.

69
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,910
除非隔板能恢复一些元气 否则我根本无法开展手术
I can't even begin to operate until Bulkhead regains some strength.

70
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,580
你是不是不打算告诉我是谁干的？
You gonna tell me who did this to him?

71
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:15,130
我认为比起复仇 眼下我们更应关注如何令隔板恢复
At the moment, I believe it is best to focus our attention on Bulkhead's recovery rather than revenge.

72
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,580
这活儿交给你了
You do that.

73
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,510
你知道 千斤顶肯定会莽撞行事的
Wheeljack will most likely do something rash, you know.

74
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,710
可我不确定 如果他执意如此 我们能否阻止得了他
And I am not sure we could stop him if we wanted to.

75
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,100
你在这里做什么？
Where are you doing here?

76
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,500
去找伤害隔板的虎子 你加入吗？
Going after the Con who hurt Bulkhead. You in?

77
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,150
我送你回去
I'm taking you back.

78
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,990
不 等等！
No, wait.

79
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,200
孩子 我明白
Kid, I get it.

80
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,950
你想以牙还牙 你和我想的一样
You want payback, you and me both.

81
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,700
隔板也是我的搭档
Bulkhead is my partner, too.

82
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,780
相信我 威震天那个害惨我们大男孩的手下\N一旦被我找了出来
Trust me, when I find out which one of Megatron's goons jumped our boy

83
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,680
我会让他尝尝…我的方式
I'll take care of him... my way.

84
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,280
我知道是谁干的
I know who did it.

85
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,370
谁？
Who?

86
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,260
带上我 我就告诉你
Take me and I'll tell you.

87
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,230
你应该亲眼看看雷霆救援队的火种被熄灭
You should have seen the Wrecker's face as his Spark expired

88
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,760
他知道自己死在了一个真正的战士手中
knowing that he perished at the hand of a true warrior.

89
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,840
威震天陛下现在明白了
Lord Megatron now understands

90
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,220
艰巨的任务最好分配给机器昆虫
that the difficult tasks are best assigned to an Insecticon.

91
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,370
恶臭的食腐者
Pit-bound scavengers.

92
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,980
吃垃圾的
Scrap eaters.

93
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,610
你说什么？
What did you say?

94
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,790
这种小事若打击还在的话要简单的多
Detailing was so much easier when Breakdown was around.

95
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,150
这是怎么回事？
What is going on out there?

96
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,140
我要怎么…啊！
How am I supposed to concentr... AH!

97
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,250
人家才打磨过的！
I just buffed that!

98
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,760
你知道在哪里能找到霸天虎的能量矿？
You know where to find Decepticon mines?

99
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,710
你以为我到这颗小石头球上 是来混日子的？
You didn't think I've just been sitting on my can since I've been on this rock?

100
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,720
你确定这是一个霸天虎的虫巢？
But shouldn't we be at an Insecticon hive?

101
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,440
机器昆虫由一个整体意识联在一起
The bugs are bound by a single mind.

102
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,740
想从中找出一个个体几乎是不可能的
Trying to draw just one of them out is nearly impossible

103
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,080
所以我们要弄出点动静
so we're gonna make some noise.

104
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
然后让虎子们交出硬壳
And get the Cons to hand over Hardshell.

105
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,730
你溜进去探查情况比我要容易得多
Now, you can sneak in there and scope things out a lot easier than I can.

106
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,640
在主矿区有五至六个机械兵
We got five, maybe six troopers in the main cavern

107
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,580
上面还有两个负责放哨的
and two more keeping an eye on things from the second floor.

108
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,260
干得好 孩子 继续前进
Good job, kid. Keep going.

109
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,190
还有一个舱室
There's another chamber.

110
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,500
似乎是他们的仓库
Looks like they're just using it for storage.

111
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,980
千斤顶 你在吗？
Wheeljack, you there?

112
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,290
现在怎么做？
Now what?

113
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,850
我们给威震天一个惊喜
We give Megatron a shout.

114
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,030
看看他们做了什么？
Just look what they've done.

115
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,700
少跟我装相 击倒
Spare me the dramatics, Knockout.

116
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,050
不过是些小擦伤
It's merely a scratch.

117
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,690
这不仅是我的个人问题 威震天陛下
This isn't about me, Lord Megatron.

118
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,790
机器昆虫在队伍中制造混乱
The Insecticons are creating dissension among the ranks.

119
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,640
这群野蛮人对战舰以及船员都构成了威胁
These savages are a threat to this warship and its crew.

120
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,000
他们必须受到限制与约束！
They should be confined... restrained, even!

121
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,580
你可拿不出什么强劲到足以限制我们的措施来
You could not produce restraints strong enough to hold us!

122
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,570
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

123
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,000
我们接收到一条来自TVC15矿区的紧急信息
We're receiving an emergency transmission from mine TVC-15.

124
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,880
发生了什么情况？
What seems to be the problem?

125
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,220
不清楚 君王 该通讯只有您能接听
Unclear, my liege. The caller will speak only to you.

126
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,200
什么事？
What is it?

127
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,980
你这儿的工作不错啊 威震天
Nice operation you got here, Megatron

128
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,390
不过你或许会说 现在它换了新经理
although, technically, you might say it's under new management.

129
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,300
千斤顶 人送外号爆炸千
Wheeljack, the one who enjoys explosive devices.

130
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,040
我能说什么呢 老大 我生来如此
What can I say, Chief? I'm uncouth.

131
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,420
不过我现在正在你一个矿藏丰富的矿洞上方
And right now, I'm sitting on top of one of your big, juicy mining ops.

132
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,730
损失一点资源对霸天虎的伟业造不成什么打击
The loss of one asset is hardly a blow to the Decepticon cause.

133
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,370
或许吧 不过我会一个接一个地摧毁它们
Maybe, but I'm gonna keep on hitting them, one by one

134
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,820
直到你交出我想要的东西
until you give me what I want.

135
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,760
你想要的东西？
And what, pray tell, would that be?

136
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,970
试图杀害隔板的机器昆虫渣滓
The Insecticon scum who tried to frag Bulkhead.

137
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,030
试图？
Tried?

138
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,910
你是说那个汽车人还活着？
Are you saying the Autobot lives?

139
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,640
他在虚张声势
He is bluffing!

140
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
要不要打个赌 听听条件吧
Wouldn't bet on it. So, here's the deal.

141
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,230
我将会发送下一个目标的坐标
I'm gonna transmit the coordinates of my next target.

142
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,120
如果硬壳来见我
If Hardshell cares to meet me there

143
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,920
他没准能让你避免另一场损失
maybe he can save you from another loss.

144
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:01,250
威震天 你想不想知道3吨的能量爆炸是否悦耳？
And, Megatron, just in case you ever wondered what 3 tons of exploding Energon sounds like...

145
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,960
你没能杀死那个汽车人？？
You allowed the Autobot to live?!

146
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,760
哼 虫子们干的活漏洞百出
Hmph! Bugs. Not all they're cracked up to be.

147
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,130
威震天陛下 我对火种源发誓
Lord Megatron, I swear upon the Allspark

148
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,810
那个汽车人受的伤绝对致命
the Autobot could not have survived his wounds!

149
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,150
你欠我一个火种
Then you owe me a Spark.

150
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,040
如果不是隔板的那一个
And if it's not the one belonging to Bulkhead

151
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,600
那就给我千斤顶的！
it had better be Wheeljack's!

152
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,020
或许你需要进入节电模式一会儿
Maybe you ought to power down for a while.

153
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,290
我很好
I'm good.

154
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,830
他会挺过来的 对吧？
He's gonna make it, right?

155
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,250
没问题的 孩子
No question, kid.

156
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,910
隔板是我认识的最坚韧的雷霆救援队员
Bulkhead's the toughest wrecking ball I've ever known

157
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,300
小救是位好大夫 最好的
and Ratchet's a great Doc, the best.

158
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,460
没错 隔板没理由错过我们计划好的全部活动
Yeah. There's no way Bulk would miss all the stuff we have planned...

159
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,300
汽车滑行 环球大破坏 我都排在日程上了
car sledding, worldwide smash-a-thon. We've been making a list.

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,000
就像我说的 隔板无比坚强 一定会挺过来的
Like I said, Bulkhead's too stubborn not to pull through.

161
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,770
我明白这点 我知道你也明白
I know it, and I bet you do, too.

162
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,250
我起来了
I'm up!

163
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,650
该怎么做？
What's the plan?

164
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,210
孩子 如果我发生了什么不测 按这个
Kid, if anything happens to me, press this.

165
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,750
我预设了自动驾驶 可以送你回擎天柱的基地
I've preset the autopilot to get you back to Prime's base.

166
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,950
什么？没门儿！
What? No way!

167
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,210
我们说好了
We had a deal.

168
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,770
你说过我可以帮忙
You said I could help!

169
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,380
你确实做到了
And you did.

170
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,190
不过到此为止吧
But it ends here.

171
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,810
这也是我的战斗！
This is my fight, too.

172
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,200
抱歉了孩子 不过隔板就要醒了
Sorry, kid, but Bulkhead's gonna wake up.

173
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,990
如果那时你不在 他会连我的铆钉都踢下来的
And he'll file off my rivets if you're not there when he does.

174
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,130
千斤顶！
Wheeljack!

175
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,780
你在那里吗 虫子？
You in there, bug?!

176
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,020
感谢你那位废物朋友
Thanks to your crippled friend

177
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,700
我已经习惯你们雷霆救援队的小把戏了
I am all too familiar with your Wrecker tricks.

178
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,280
怎么了 硬壳？
What's the matter, Hardshell?

179
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,350
不习惯和没中毒的对手作战吗？
Not used to fighting a bot who hasn't been doused in Tox-En?

180
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,270
在战斗中谈话是弱小的表现
Talk during battle is a sign of weakness.

181
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,900
那只能证明你过于原始 无法一心二用
Only when you're too primitive to do two things at once.

182
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,870
快去拿手榴弹！
Go for the grenade!

183
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,010
千斤顶！
Wheeljack!

184
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,890
不！
No!

185
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,720
走 孩子 快离开这里
Go, kid. Get out of here.

186
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,440
你的火种将敬献给威震天陛下！
Your Spark will now belong to Megatron.

187
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,100
干得漂亮 孩子
Nice work, kid.

188
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,880
千斤顶 快跑！
Wheeljack, run!!

189
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,640
我记得我告诉你按自动驾驶键的
I thought I told you to hit autopilot.

190
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,500
没有我罩着 汽车人总会碰上各种麻烦
Bad things happen to bots when I leave their side.

191
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,850
目标太多
Too many to pick off.

192
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,570
我需要使用爆炸范围更广的武器
I'll need something with a wider blast radius.

193
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,070
我还以为你…
But I thought you...

194
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,820
我一次只携带一个
I only carry one at a time.

195
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,460
欢迎加入雷霆救援队 孩子
Welcome to the Wreckers, kid.

196
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,020
隔板会为你骄傲的
You did Bulkhead proud.

197
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,560
但我觉得这不会改变什么
Then why don't I feel any different?

198
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,400
神子？你还好吗？
Miko, you okay?

199
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,700
她很好 这孩子很专业
She's fine! Kid's a pro.

200
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,100
我没和你说话！
I wasn't talking to you.

201
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,250
他怎么样？
How is he?

202
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,010
隔板会活下来
Bulkhead will survive.

203
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,660
但他或许永远也无法痊愈了
He may never be fully functional again.

204
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,440
神子！我认为你还不能…
Miko, I don't think it's wise for you...

205
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,190
我…我不确定我现在是否想见隔板
I'm... not sure I want to see Bulk right now.

206
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,290
不想在这种情况下…
Not like this.

207
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
我再也不会离开你了
I'm never leaving you again.

208
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,800
这是汽车人干的？
The Autobot did this?!

209
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,230
不是 我的陛下 是… 一个人类小女孩
No, my lord. It was... a human girl.
