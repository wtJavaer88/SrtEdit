1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,090
在上一集中
Previously on Transformers Prime...

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,220
尽管下载到的铁堡数据不完整
The download of the Iacon database may have been incomplete

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,130
但我们已经拥有了战舰所破译的四个坐标
but we now possess four sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,840
如果我们想赶在霸天虎之前得到铁堡的遗物
If we are to have any hope of recovering the Iacon relics before the Decepticons do

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,160
我们就必须分头行动
we must divide our resources.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,660
派出多支小队 同时前往这四个地点
Dispatching multiple squadrons will enable us to pursue all four coordinates simultaneously.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,530
保持警惕 隔板
Be on your guard, Bulkhead.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,170
救护车 到这边来！
Ratchet, come here.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,350
铁堡数据库
The Iacon database.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,510
它下载到我们的主机上来了！
It's downloading into our mainframe.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,590
哈哈哈！拉斐尔你真是个天才！
Hahahahaha! Rafael, you are a genius!

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,560
隔板回来了 福勒探员
Bulkhead's coming through, Agent Fowler.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,410
我等不及要分享这个消息了！
I can't wait to share the news.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,760
不…！
No!

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,350
谁是你们中的最强者？
Who is the fiercest among you?

16
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,710
说到凶残 什么也不及一整窝的机器昆虫
There is no greater ferocity than Insecticon hive

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,020
但您一定要从我们中间挑一个的话…
but if you would to choose one among us...

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,880
…我是硬壳
... I am Hardshell.

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,190
你去替我拿回一样东西 硬壳
You will retrieve something for me, Hardshell

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,330
并消灭一切敢于阻挠你的人！
and annihilate everything that gets in your way!

21
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,690
散开！迅速行动 踏上征途！
Divide and do not hesitate to conquer!

22
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,630
神子和杰克陪大黄蜂还有阿尔茜前往
Miko and Jack will accompany Arcee and Bumblebee.

23
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,830
太好了！
Yes!

24
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,250
开始传送
Initiate transport...

25
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,010
同时开始定位另外三组坐标
... and triangulate coordinates of the other three relics.

26
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,730
这可不是远足 神子
That was some trick, Miko.

27
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,430
那从威震天鼻子底下扫描情报呢？
You mean, swiping intel from right under Megatron's nose?

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
我是领袖卫队的一员！
Just doing my part for team Prime!

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,990
哦 我得走了 小隔
Oh, got to go Bulk!

30
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,660
等我回来再跟你讲整个故事
I'll tell you all about it when we get back.

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,940
等等我！
Wait up!

32
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,080
- 照顾好她 小蜂\N- 照顾好他 神子
- Take care of her, Bee.\N- Take care of him, Miko.

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,160
隔板 准备出发
Bulkhead, prepare for departure.

34
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,330
你将前往赤道
You are headed for the equator.

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,270
我去体会热带风情了 雷霆救援队来袭！
I'll prep for tropical weather... wrecker style.

36
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,960
拉斐尔和福勒探员负责联络和进行传送
Rafael and Agent Fowler will be your communications and transportation hub.

37
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,260
我吃不下芝士汉堡包了 呃！
I can't. That's cheeseburger!

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,340
联络 嗯？
Communications, huh?

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,340
保持警惕 隔板
Be on your guard, Bulkhead.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,590
哦 哦！
Oh...

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,780
比霸天虎兵营还要难闻！
Smells worse than a Decepticon barraks.

42
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,100
真是个藏遗物的好地方！
Fine place to hide a relic.

43
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,020
基地 我找不到任何遗物的信号
Base, I can't find any sight of the relic.

44
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,870
你能确定坐标吗？
Can you reconfirm coordinates?

45
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,920
正在测定你的位置 隔板
Triangulating your position, Bulkhead.

46
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,580
你的位置没有错误
You're at the correct location.

47
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,170
哦 得来点咖啡
Oh... Need coffee...

48
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,150
那就是坐标错了 这里什么都没有…
And the coordinates are wrong, 'cause there is nothing here.

49
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,710
…不过有东西来了！
But something's coming.

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,060
威震天派只虫子来替他干见不得人的勾当
Leave it to Megatron to send a bug to do his dirty work.

51
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,250
你也不是什么清白的货色 救援队小子！
You know a thing or two of dirty work yourself, Wrecker.

52
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,930
我认识你吗？
Do I know you?

53
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,630
我认识你的同类
I know your kind...

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,720
因为我这辈子碾碎的救援队员已经数不清了
... as I have crossed more than a few Wreckers in my time.

55
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,480
瞧你这个大块头
Now you see the thing about bugs your size.

56
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,650
等我砸碎你时 得是多大的一块废铁！
They make a bigger mess when I smash them.

57
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,980
救护车 病毒编写完成
Ratchet, the virus is coded.

58
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,520
开始上传
Commencing upload.

59
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,380
拉夫 我猜到遗物的位置了
Raf, I have a bead on the relic.

60
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,010
拉夫正忙 我来接手
Raf is busy. I'll take it from here.

61
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,600
福勒！睡得怎么样？
Fowler? How was your beauty sleep?

62
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,000
很好 梦到你终于对我尊重点了
Fine. Jumped I finally got low respect from you.

63
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,610
继续做梦吧！
Keep dreaming.

64
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,820
你的情况？
What's your status?

65
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,030
在坐标处一无所获
Came up empty to provided coordinates.

66
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,540
但我猜想应该是早期的熔岩流把遗物带下了山
But I'm figuring old lava flow might have carried relic downhill.

67
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,180
熔岩不会烧毁遗物吗？
Wouldn't that just burn it up?

68
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,630
遗物能经受住星际旅行
This relic survived interstellar transport

69
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,300
我相信它们禁得住岩浆…
I'm sure that can stand multi....

70
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,740
…哦 该死！
... oh, scrap.

71
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,750
怎么了？
What is it?

72
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,670
我在漏能量 机器昆虫把我伤得不轻
I'm leaking Energon. Insecticon hit me hard.

73
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,140
机器昆虫？
Insecticon?

74
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,660
大概垫片没有受损
Probably not the gasket wheels.

75
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,590
没什么可担心的 相信我
Nothing to worry about.

76
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,280
他比我惨得多
Trust me, he's a way worse shape than I am.

77
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,920
他留了我一条命
The Wrecker left me alive.

78
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,290
这是致命的错误
The last mistake he will ever make.

79
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,200
找到你了！
There you are!

80
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,410
盖子打开了！
Got the lid off.

81
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,010
啊哦 基地 我们有麻烦了
O-oh. Base... we have a problem.

82
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,700
隔板 怎么了？
Bulkhead, what is it?

83
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,210
我找到遗物了 是一个能量储存块
I found the relic. It's a cash of Energon.

84
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,820
那很好 不是吗？
That's good, right?

85
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,100
不 不 不 不是这种好法
No-no-no, not this kind.

86
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,640
它被称为毒能
It's known as Tox-En.

87
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,210
接触后会产生恶心和头晕
Causes nausy and dizziness upon contact.

88
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,750
长期暴露其中会使我们麻痹
Prolong exposal weakens us to the point of paralysis.

89
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,620
最终 熄灭我们的火种
And then... it snuffs out our sparks.

90
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,860
那还说这么多干嘛？
Well, what do you talking to me for?

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,020
快远离那个毒能！
Get far away from that Tox-En. Prompto.

92
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,730
如果它真像传说的那般致命
If it is as deadly as you say...

93
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,320
虎子们也不会想得到它！
... the 'Cons won't want it either.

94
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,380
不 他们十分想得到它
No, they'll want it even more.

95
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,340
在塞博特恩的战争中
During the war for Cybertron.

96
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,520
威震天找到一种提炼天然毒能的方法
Megatron figured out a way to refine raw Tox-En...

97
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,030
制作成一种大规模杀伤性武器
... turning it to a weapon of mass destruction.

98
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,330
我目睹了一整支部队因中毒而全军覆没
I witnessed when entire unit wiped out by the sickness.

99
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,110
我绝不能把这东西留给虎子们用来为非作歹
No way I can leave this stuff for 'Cons to find and abuse.

100
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,380
那么把它带回来
So bring it back here.

101
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,500
拉夫？打开环陆桥
Raf? Open a Ground Bridge.

102
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,030
不行 就算我们能找到安全的容器保存它
Forget it. Even if we had a safe place to store it...

103
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,470
这东西的潜在威胁也很大 不能冒险再让其他人接触它
... the stuff's way too potently risky to exposing the rest of us...

104
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,280
啊 我等会儿再联系你
I'll call you back.

105
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,990
我要用雷霆救援队的方式来处理这个东西
I gonna need to take care of this... Wrecker style.

106
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,670
嗯 在那里！
There.

107
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,600
不 等等！
No! Wait!

108
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,660
啊 毒能！
Tox-En.

109
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,050
什么 你带着它走？
Wait, you're carying it?

110
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,630
那东西不是有毒吗？
I thought that stuff was toxic.

111
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,300
是有毒 但是我需要与虫子们拉开距离
It is. But I needed to put some distance between me and the bugs.

112
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,740
好吧 那要怎么做？
Well, what now?

113
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,650
只有一个办法可以处理掉这堆冒气的东西
I'm gonna get rid of this steaming pile the only way I can.

114
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,610
我要把它扔进火山
I'm gonna lob it into the volcano.

115
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,410
那些昆虫怎么办？
What about the insect problem?

116
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,630
知道吗 我对反侦查很有心得
This isn't my first time aluding an enemy patrol, you know.

117
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,800
威震天陛下 我们要找的物品
Lord Megatron, the object we seek...

118
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,440
是毒能
It is Tox-En.

119
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,320
那你到底拿到了多少？
Exactly how much is in your possession?

120
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,800
一无所获 我的主人 一个汽车人…
None, my lord. An Autobot...

121
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,670
你不是最强的机器昆虫吗？
Are you not the fiercest Insecticon?

122
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,550
等等 你在远离火山？
Wait, you're moving away from the volcano?

123
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,570
完全正确…
Exactly.

124
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,550
下边！
Below.

125
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,010
没错… 从救援队那小子的伤口流下来的
Yes.  The Wrecker leaks from his wounds.

126
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,220
找到他！
Find him!

127
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,480
你留下了误导的踪迹 哈？
You did the false trail, huh?

128
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,090
我曾在敌人后方与部队走散时
I once pulled that trick when I got separated...

129
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,160
也用过这招
... from my unit behind enemy lines.

130
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,090
你什么时候到过敌人后方？
When where you ever behind enemy lines?

131
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,960
我以前可不是机器人保姆
I wasn't always a bot-sitter.

132
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,000
下次你该说你妈妈晚上没有帮你掖被子了
Next you gonna tell me your mother doesn't tuck you in at night?

133
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,730
这可是基本训练
That's as basic training.

134
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,130
训练做什么？秀场小丑吗？
Training as what? A rodeo clown?

135
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,020
你浪费了太多时间去陪神子玩怪物卡车了
You was been way too muc time in monster truck rallies with Miko.

136
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
我曾是一个游骑兵队员
I was an army ranger.

137
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,600
我们干得不比任何人差
We could wreck with the best of them.

138
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,920
谁能想到我们如此相像
Who knew you and I are so much alike.

139
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,000
拉斐尔 福勒探员恢复知觉了吗？
Rafael! Has Agent Fowler regained consciousness?

140
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,450
等一下 隔板
Stand by, Bulkhead.

141
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,530
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

142
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,940
我在这儿 擎天柱
I'm here, Prime.

143
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,220
你那边是什么情况？
What's the situation?

144
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,810
我需要进入一处考察站 就在我所在的位置
I require access to a research facility at my current coordinates.

145
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,520
让我联系一下
Let me make a call.

146
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,910
只有雷霆救援队员
The dirty job.

147
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,640
干得了这样的脏活
That only a Wrecker can do.

148
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,450
来吧！
C'mon!

149
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,090
这是紧急情况
This is an emergency!

150

好吧 我得…休息…一小会儿

神子 我的职责是保护你…

181
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,070
隔板 我待在十吨重的钢筋铁骨里面

我吐在脚垫上了 抱歉

187
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
我在成为战士之前 是个工人
Before I became a warrior, I was a labourer.

188
