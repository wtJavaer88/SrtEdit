1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,400
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime...

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,560
看上去飞船有了自己的意识！
It appears the ship now possesses a will of its own.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,820
而且它似乎比我们更擅长破译铁堡计划的数据库
It also seems to be doing a better job of decoding the project Iacon database than we were.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,750
不管用什么手段 夺回战舰的控制权！
Regain control of this vessel by any means necessary.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,790
这或许是我们登舰下载铁堡数据库的唯一机会
This could be our only chance to slip aboard and download the Iacon database.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,400
为什么这艘战舰在飞向曼哈顿？
Why is the warship heading for Manhattan?

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,180
铁堡的圣物在很久以前失落到了地球上
The Iacon relics landed on Earth eons ago

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,450
远早于城市建立的时间
long before the city was built atop it.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,110
福勒探员 才下载了这么点？
Agent Fowler! That's all that's been downloaded?!

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,910
快跑！
Run for it!

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,720
快 我们快走！
Come on. Here's our ride!

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,410
尽管下载到的铁堡数据不完整
The download of the Iacon database may have been incomplete

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,650
但我们已经拥有了战舰所破译的四个坐标
but we now possess four sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,590
那我们必须尽快行动
Then we must act quickly

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,740
因为 威震天会毫不犹豫地夺取那里的超级武器…
for Megatron will not hesitate to obtain the potential doomsday devices which lie at the site of each.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,030
如果我们想赶在霸天虎之前得到铁堡的遗产
If we are to have any hope of recovering the Iacon relics before the Decepticons do

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,980
我们就必须分头行动
we must divide our resources.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,180
但是擎天柱
But Optimus

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,990
我们人手本来就不足…
when it comes to numbers, we are already at a grave disadvantage.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,660
在目前情况下 快速应变最为重要
Under the circumstances, swiftness of action is paramount.

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,640
这是一场我们输不起的竞赛
This is one race that we absolutely cannot afford to lose.

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,750
派出多支小队 同时前往这四个地点
Dispatching multiple squadrons will enable us to pursue all four coordinates simultaneously.

23
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,880
威震天陛下 您要的第一处坐标具体发掘方案
Lord Megatron, I have assembled the mining detail

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,220
我已经拟订好了
you requested for the first set of coordinates.

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,340
上次我和打击成功收回了铁堡的遗产
Breakdown and I enjoyed previous success retrieving Iacon relics.

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,890
这次我也会用成功向死去的战友致敬
In memory of my fallen comrade, I intend to do the same again.

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,200
这是个任务
This is a mission

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,600
不是让你出去飙车兜风
not one of your racing excursions.

29
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,200
少在那儿夸夸其谈！
Stop your preening!

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,760
服从军令 立即去执行！
Move quickly and operate with a surgeon's skill!

31
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,910
明白我的意思了吗 击倒？
Do you understand me, Knockout?!

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,150
呃…遵命 威震天陛下
Explicitly, lord Megatron.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,320
好吧 鉴于打击不幸牺牲 你势单力薄
Now, since the unfortunate loss of Breakdown has left you rather vulnerable

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,370
我再给你一个后援
you will require appropriate support.

35
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,800
您真是…考虑周到
How very... repellant.

36
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,740
情势有变
Here's a twist.

37
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,730
看上去霸天虎似乎从曼哈顿撤出了
It would appear that the Decepticons have retreated from Manhattan.

38
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,090
他们就这么…放弃离开了？
They just... up and left?

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,480
看上去更像威震天已经派出部队进入了地下
It is more likely that Megatron has already set course for the second set of coordinates

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,650
而他自己赶去第二个坐标处了
having dispatched a unit to this relic's underground location.

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,950
不用摧毁那片城区吗？
Without busting up a city block to get to it?

42
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,900
他们走了地铁隧道
They used subway tunnels.

43
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,760
纽约有完善的地铁网络贯穿整个城市地下
New York has a whole network of them running beneath the city.

44
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,880
既然人类并没有受到直接威胁
Since the human population no longer seems to be directly threatened

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,410
那么我们仍需保持隐蔽行动
maintaining our disguise will be necessary.

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,770
阿尔茜 大黄蜂
Arcee, Bumblebee

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,320
你们是去这种人口密集地区的最佳人选
you are the best choices to navigate through such a densely populated area.

48
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,240
擎天柱？纽约有八百多万人口
Optimus, New York has more than 8 million people.

49
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,120
即使在地下活动
The odds of being spotted by at least one of them are pretty high

50
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,940
被发现的可能性也很大
even if they are headed underground.

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,900
你说这话什么意思？
Where are you going with this?

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,630
他们需要个代理人
You're gonna need a face man.

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,660
得有人替他们应付局面
Someone who can speak on their behalf.

54
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,280
一个在他们暴露时可以提供掩护的人
A human who can run interference if their cover gets blown.

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,510
我进过地铁站
Well, I've actually been in subway stations.

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,170
我就生长在一座大都会城市
I grew up in a major metropolis

57
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,820
而不像某位“从来没离开过内华达贾斯帕”先生
unlike Mr. "I've never been outside Jasper, Nevada".

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,320
我可去过塞博特恩
I have been to Cybertron.

59
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,740
塞博特恩没有地铁！
Cybertron doesn't have subways.

60
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,500
是吧？
Does it?

61
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,720
从实战经验来看 福勒探员是最佳人选
Agent Fowler's field experience makes him our best candidate.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,760
可惜他还没从霸天虎战舰的遭遇中恢复过来
If he weren't still recovering for his encounter with the Decepticon warship.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,520
而我们却安然无事！这不是偶然！
Which we survived without incident.

64
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,900
好吧 神子和杰克陪大黄蜂还有阿尔茜前往
Very well. Miko and Jack will accompany Arcee and Bumblebee.

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,130
太好了！
Yes!

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,720
开始传送
Initiate transport

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,890
同时开始定位另外三组坐标
and triangulate coordinates of the other three relics.

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,450
早说这儿跟塞博特恩不一样吧
Of course, it's no Cybertron...

69
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,940
好吧代理人 我们怎么进入地下
All right, face, how do we get underground?

70
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,720
这个 显然你们不能指望\N直接通过地铁闸门而不被别人注意到
Well, you can't just jump the turnstiles and hope no one notices.

71
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,330
看这边！工地！
Check it out! Construction.

72
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,130
大城市总少不了这个
A fact of life in the big city.

73
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,000
别动 大黄蜂！
Bumblebee, don't move!

74
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,760
输电轨
The third rail.

75
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,220
它是给地铁输送电能的
It carries electricity to power the subway trains.

76
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,080
只要碰一下 噗兹 烧焦你
One touch and zap! You're fried.

77
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,410
他一定是从什么电视节目上学到的这些
He must have learned about that on TV or something.

78
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,560
我们能再快点吗？
Could we please pick up the pace?

79
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,180
这里的湿气会侵蚀我的底盘的
The humidity down here is threatening to corrode my undercarriage.

80
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,800
能别老哼哼 行吗？
Must you hover?!

81
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,250
我们接近了吗？
Are we getting any closer?

82
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,680
准确定位坐标不难
Triangulating the coordinates is one thing...

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,250
难的是在这个迷宫里找到通路
but figuring out how to reach them through this maze is another.

84
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,520
钻孔声
Drilling.

85
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,720
是从这边传来的！
It's coming from this way!

86
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,140
神子！
Miko!

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,870
神子 你怎么…？
Miko, what is your...

88
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,810
在那边别动！
Hold it right there!

89
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,790
- 见鬼！\N- 见鬼！
- Scrap.\N- Scrap.

90
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,280
你们两个小鬼在这下面做什么？
What are you kids doing down here?

91
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,510
我们是跟学校来郊游的
We're... on a field trip... with our school.

92
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,150
但是我们走丢了
But we got lost.

93
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,890
噢 是吗？
Oh, really?

94
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,860
我跟他说过 我们应该跟上同伴
I told him we should stay with our group

95
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,920
但是“伦纳德”坚持要去找化石
but Leonard here insisted we search for fossils.

96
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,140
我的错
My bad.

97
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,900
我想回家…
I want to go home.

98
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,170
…你能帮我们吗 您是…
Can you help us, mister...

99
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,060
沃莫 叫我沃格也行
Vogel. But you can call me Vogel.

100
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,170
那么 有没有乘坐过清洁工火车？
So, ever ride a sweeper train?

101
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,740
掩护
Face.

102
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,830
这一段是三十年代建造的
And this section was added in the '30s

103
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,740
当时公共工程的一部分
as part of a public-works project.

104
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,900
真…漂亮…
Fascinating.

105
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,620
这些老隧道也有阴暗的一面
But these old tunnels have a dark side, too.

106
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,430
据说有怪异的生物潜伏在这里：
Strange creatures have been said to lurk down here.

107
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,590
巨蟒 白色短吻鳄 甚至还有鼹鼠人
Giant snakes, albino alligators, even mole men.

108
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,420
那不过是些流浪汉无家可归
Well, but those are just people who live down here

109
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,080
才住在这下面 不是吗？
because they have no place else to go, right?

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,510
那不过是媒体宣传的
That's what the media wants you to believe.

111
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,840
但要我说 他们来自外太空
But I say, they're from outer space.

112
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,800
我告诉你们
I'm telling you

113
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,670
这些都不是51区干的
Area 51's got nothing on this place.

114
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
外星人在这下面呢！
The aliens are down here

115
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,510
他们在组建军队
building up their army

116
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,280
说不定抓了人类做苦役
plotting to use us humans as slave labor.

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,180
外星人？哈哈哈 但愿他知道…
Aliens, huh? Hahaha... If he only knew.

118
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,700
我收到一个定位信号
I'm picking up a locator beacon.

119
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,620
虎子们已经挖出了圣物
The 'Cons have unearthed the relic.

120
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,710
快拿给我看看
Well? Let me see it already!

121
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,100
准备交火
Lock and load.

122
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
还愣着干什么！
Attack, already!

123
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,110
我去抢圣物
I'll get the relic!

124
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,770
你的脸蛋很漂亮
You have lovely features

125
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,620
正适合来搞一个\N我称之为“呲牙裂嘴”的痛苦小实验
perfect for a painful little procedure I call  the "nip and tuck".

126
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,190
回旋踢！
Dodge and kick.

127
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,520
电倒你！
Shock and drop.

128
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,170
这边！
This way.

129
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,890
你怎么知道的？
How do you know?

130
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,010
神子 让我们好好想想
Miko, let's think this through.

131
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,670
为什么？你觉得我不知道自己在做什么？
Why? 'Cause you think I don't know what I'm doing?

132
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,650
“我是杰克 擎天柱派我去塞博特恩\N所以我肯定什么都懂！”
"I'm Jack! Optimus picked me to go to Cybertron, so I must know everything!"

133
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,330
好了神子 你真这么想？
Okay, Miko, seriously...

134
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,620
如果那就是你的烦心事 那之前为什么不说？
if that's what's bugging you, then why didn't you say something before?

135
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,550
我在努力克制
I've been holding it in.

136
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,150
你还会克制？
Since when do you hold anything in?

137
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,380
你看 这不是说你就没有贡献
Look, it's not like you don't contribute.

138
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,380
就在昨天\N你还帮忙击落了一艘发了神经的霸天虎飞船！
Just yesterday, you helped take down a psychotic Decepticon warship.

139
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,010
这不是在竞赛！
This isn't a competition!

140
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,680
迷路了 哈？
Lost, huh?

141
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,220
你们俩得跟纽约交通管理部门解释清楚！
You two are gonna have to explain yourselves to the New York transit authority.

142
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,040
我想我们应该说出真相
I think we should tell him the truth.

143
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,460
好吧
Right.

144
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,850
事实上…我们弄丢了我们的狗
The truth is... we lost our dog.

145
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,470
你在白费口舌！
You're wasting your breath.

146
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,440
真正的真相！
The real truth.

147
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,190
我们需要阻止外星人
We're trying to prevent aliens

148
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,110
不能让他们挖出一种远古的强力武器 否则我们的星球会被毁灭！
from digging up a powerful ancient relic so they can't use it to destroy our planet.

149
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,110
我就觉得今天早些时候我听到了奇怪的声音
I swore I heard something weird and high-pitched earlier today...

150
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,720
在五号道挖掘的那些肯定不是施工队！
something that wasn't the crew drilling over on track 5.

151
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,930
现在 让我们来看看你到底是个啥 有啥作用
Now, shall we see precisely what you are and what you do?

152
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,680
除了进行活体试验
And what better way to learn your power

153
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,060
还有什么更好的方法呢？
than to conduct an on-site experiment?

154
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,830
鼹鼠人！金属的！
Mole men! Metal ones!

155
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,310
事实上 是霸天虎
Actually, Decepticons.

156
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
他们抓住了阿尔茜和大黄蜂！
And they have Arcee and Bumblebee.

157
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,240
沃格 这玩意儿还能开得更快吗？
Vogel, this thing have another gear?

158
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,790
当然能！
Abso-Freakin'-Lutely!

159
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,950
嘿！小心我的喷漆！
Hey! Watch the finish!

160
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,410
我也不喜欢逃跑 不过我得去赶火车了！
Hate to run, but I just missed my train.

161
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,800
去追圣物 我去带回杰克和神子！
Follow the relic. I'll grab Jack and Miko.

162
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,610
不太妙！一定是刹车线坏了！
Not good. Brake line must have been torched.

163
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,880
没法刹车？
We can't stop?

164
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,040
没关系
No big deal.

165
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,360
这条轨道有几英里长 不是吗 沃格？
These tracks go around for miles, right, Vogel?

166
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,870
这条不是！
Not this one.

167
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,330
这条是死路？就是说我们会撞毁？
This track dead-ends, as in crash and burn?

168
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,480
我真的开始讨厌火车了！
I'm really starting to hate trains!

169
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,160
那是什么?
What was that?

170
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,930
欢迎来到地球！
Welcome to Earth!

171
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,850
沃格 不要！
Vogel, no!

172
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,800
她是好人！
She's one of the good guys!

173
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,800
阿尔茜 刹车失灵了！
Arcee, the brakes are shot!

174
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,960
有备用控制吗？
Is there any kind of emergency override?

175
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,560
没有 女士
N-No, ma'am!

176
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,050
不过前方有个扳道闸门
But there is a switch-track control up ahead.

177
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,650
只要拉动拉杆就行
If you can just adjust the pole rod...

178
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,990
看见你就明白了 可以转到另外一条轨道
You'll know it when you see it. It'll re-route us to another line.

179
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,600
她变成了一辆…摩托车？
Did she just turn into... a motorcycle?

180
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,150
啊哦
Uh-Oh.

181
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,830
那个是？
And that would be?

182
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,210
坏蛋
Trouble.

183
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,940
哇哦 看看是谁又能变形了
Well, well, look who got his treads back.

184
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,430
见鬼！
Scrap!

185
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,730
- 耶！\N- 好极了！\N- 太棒了！
- Yes!\N- Alright!\N- Sweet!

186
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,940
到妈妈这儿来
Come to mama.

187
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,360
电倒你
Shock and drop.

188
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,710
呼 前面畅通无阻
We're in the clear.

189
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,710
可我们还是得停下来
Still need a way to stop...

190
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,040
而不是一头撞上墙
beside slamming into a wall, I mean.

191
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,210
小心！
Watch out!

192
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,120
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

193
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,550
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

194
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,340
哥们！
Dude!

195
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,860
你怎么…没被撞到？
How did you not get mashed?

196
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,130
相位仪
Phase shifter.

197
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,950
可以让你穿过实体 或者让实体穿过你
Handy when you need to pass through solid objects. Or vice versa.

198
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,130
不 不！
No. No!!!

199
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,840
你们刮花了我的脸 我要你们好看！
You scratch my face, I scratch yours!

200
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,560
他都知道了 我们需要把他带上吗？
He knows. Do we have to take him with us?

201
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,760
上母舰？
To the mother ship?

202
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,680
我有个妙计
I think I have a work-around.

203
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
没错 战士
That's right, soldier!

204
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,650
扔了那块石头 快点回来！
Dump that rock and come on home!

205
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,040
我是福勒 神子？什么事？什么？
Fowler. Miko, what is it? What in the sam hill?

206
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,530
我正在处理危急事件 你却要我…
I'm in the middle of a crisis here, and you want me to...

207
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,710
…让他接电话
... put him on the line.

208
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,410
沃格先生 我是美国政府特工福勒
Mr. Vogel, this is special agent William Fowler of the United States government.

209

Abso-Freakin'-Lutely!

214
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,260
啊啊 不过我们得保持无线电静默
But until then

215
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,620
除非我们主动联系你
we need to maintain complete radio silence.

216
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,790
这是我的荣幸
It's been an honor.

217
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,800

222
