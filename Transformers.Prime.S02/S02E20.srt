1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,630
能量信号变强了
Energon signal's gettin' stronger.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,580
大概在北方五公里处
About five clicks due north.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,110
你说什么？限速？
What do you mean, speed limit?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,680
我这里有一档可以开到150码!
I have a gauge in here that goes to 150.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,340
要是设计这车的人类不希望它跑那么快
If the humans who designed my vehicle form didn't want it to go that fast

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,310
那就不该给我装这个档!
they shouldn't have given me the option.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,990
哇哦！
Whoa!

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,330
嘿 飙车少年！
Hey, Indy 500!

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,120
等咱俩完事之后
When I'm through with you

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,400
恐怕你要修的就不光是车了
you're gonna need more than a pit crew to put you back together!

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,810
来啊！
Bring it!

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,880
看看到底谁更经打 嗯？
Who's the tough guy now, huh?

13
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,520
哈哈哈 别紧张 大黄蜂
Hahaha. Relax, Bumblebee.

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,240
我只不过开个玩笑而已
I'm just messin' around.

15
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,570
找到了!
Found it.

16
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,050
愤怒的老司机毫不迟疑地发布了你的照片！
Old road rage didn't waste any time posting your mug shots.

17
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,660
等拉夫回到家后 他会把这照片擦掉的
Raf will scrub this as soon as he's back from house hunting.

18
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,750
你跟钛师傅是怎么学的？
Is this what you learned while serving Alpha Trion?!

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,860
我严重怀疑他能否饶恕你这种不负责任的行为!
I highly doubt that he would have condoned such irresponsible behavior.

20
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,000
不要解除你的伪装!
Blowing your cover is not okay.

21
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,200
对不起 伙计们 我知道我真的闯了大祸
Sorry, guys. I know I really messed up.

22
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,000
救护车和阿尔茜说的都对
While Ratchet and Arcee are correct

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,250
不过我觉得这件事我们都有责任
I believe that we are all equally responsible for this incident.

24
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,280
我们？
Us?

25
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,600
怎么可能！
How?

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,760
我们又不在场！
We weren't even there.

27
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,230
好吧 小蜂在
Well, Bee was.

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,890
我们最近过多地专注于解决危机
Our recent efforts have been so intensely focused on averting crises

29
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,680
却忽略了一些基础事项
that we have overlooked simple matters

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,240
比如 教会烟幕在这个星球上的生存之道
such as teaching Smokescreen how to best function on this planet.

31
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,380
我们要弥补这一过失
It is an oversight that must be corrected.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,760
擎天柱 我很荣幸能接受您的教导
Optimus, I'm honored to train under you

33
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,950
我会不遗余力去弥补过失
and will do whatever it takes to make things right

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,470
为您争光
to make you proud.

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,170
也许了解人类世界的最好方法 是向人类请教
Perhaps the best way for you to learn about the human world is from a human.

36
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,790
再给烟幕找个搭档？
Smokescreen gets his own partner?

37
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,690
拜托 这里的三个人类还嫌不够多吗？
Please! Isn't having three humans here enough?

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,190
我指的是已经和我们在一起的某位
I was referring to one already among us.

39
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,790
啊… 没问题 擎天柱
Um... sure, Optimus.

40
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,290
隐蔽机器人形态 学习交通法规
Um, robots in disguise, traffic laws

41
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,450
不要殴打人类…
don't beat down humans...

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,090
我会让烟幕学好的
I can bring Smokescreen up to speed.

43
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,770
我们都经历过学习期
We've all put in curbside duty.

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,440
这是任务的一部分！
Part of the gig.

45
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,360
那我们上路吧 老师
Then let's go for a drive, teach.

46
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,150
擎天柱 恕我直言
Optimus, with all due respect

47
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,640
由于霸天虎发现了拉夫的住址
Agent Fowler is out relocating Raf's family

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,530
福勒探员正忙着帮拉夫搬家
because the Cons discovered where he lives.

49
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,220
然而烟幕自作聪明选择的汽车形态
Meanwhile, Smokescreen, in all his wisdom

50
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,060
车门上印着一对招摇过市的38
chooses a vehicle mode with screaming double "38S" on the doors

51
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,920
很容易被辨识出来
making him an easy target.

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,350
我没法假装我一点也不担心杰克的安危
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't more than concerned about Jack's safety.

53
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,970
但是
Nonetheless

54
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,000
我们的新人的确需要指导
the fact remains that our new recruit is in need of instruction.

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,300
我相信烟幕有一颗善良的火种
I believe that Smokescreen's spark is in the right place

56
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,760
而且他也已经懂得了必须要保护人类
and that he now understands the necessity of protecting humanity.

57
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,220
好 到路口了 复习一下
Okay, intersection. Let's review.

58
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,110
绿灯？
Light's green?

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,020
绿灯行
Green for "go".

60
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,160
黄灯？
And yellow?

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,680
加速！
Go faster!

62
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,670
喔 烟幕
Whoa, whoa! Smokescreen!

63
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,890
哈哈哈 只是开个玩笑
Hahahaha. Just messin' around!

64
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,670
哈-哈-
Ha-ha-

65
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,350
啊噢
Uh-oh.

66
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,440
怎么了？有虎子？
What is it? Cons?

67
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,720
只是个学校里我不想见的人
Just someone from school I'd rather not talk to.

68
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,320
开车！
Drive!

69
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,580
红灯 教练 不能走!
Red light, teach. No can do.

70
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,180
搞什么？
Seriously?

71
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,820
算了随他去吧
Just... let it go.

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,590
你没开玩笑吧？
Are you kiddin' me?

73
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,980
你的自尊呢？
Where's your self-respect?

74
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,740
我们得为自己出头！
We gotta stand up for ourselves.

75
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,340
我们还得遵守擎天柱的规定
We also have to follow Optimus' rule.

76
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,060
不光要保护人类
It's not just about protecting humans...

77
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,630
也不能伤害他们
you can't harm them, either.

78
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,300
我说过要伤害谁吗？
Who said anything about harming?

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,740
今晚我要把这个发出去！
I am so posting this tonight.

80
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,020
阿尔茜 阿尔茜 来看看文斯的车！
Arcee! Arcee, check out Vince's car!

81
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,450
那个小混混
The bully?

82
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,570
嘿 文斯 还想加点薯条吗？
Hey, Vince, did you want fries with that?

83
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,760
我来把这事捋顺清楚
Let me get this straight.

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,860
你教给烟幕的都是些他无论如何也用不上的快餐知识？
So you taught Smokescreen everything he never needed to know about fast food.

85
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,890
他驾驶考试通过了 寓教于乐
He passed drivers ed. Work hard, play hard.

86
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,020
没错 制作这些照片没让任何人类受伤 不骗你！
Uh, yeah. No humans were harmed in the making of these photos... honest.

87
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,270
你解密了下一个铁堡坐标？
You have decoded the next Iacon coordinates?

88
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,450
非常好 声波
Excellent, Soundwave!

89
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,560
这正是测试我们这个诱饵的大好时机…
Then it is time to beta test our decoy.

90
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,190
我快要解出下一个铁堡坐标了
I am nearly finished decoding the next Iacon coordinates.

91
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,880
你可能没必要继续解了 擎天柱
You may not need to complete your task, Optimus.

92
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,300
铁堡信号？
An Iacon-locator beacon.

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,590
看来霸天虎已经挖出了下一个遗物
It seems the Decepticons have already excavated the next relic.

94
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,040
救护车 锁定位置 启动环陆桥
Ratchet, triangulate coordinates and activate the ground bridge.

95
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,280
跟虎子们大干一场！
Bring on the Cons!

96
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,450
烟幕呢？
Where is Smokescreen?

97
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,320
跟杰克在外面“学习”呢
Out training again with Jack.

98
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,590
我们不能等了
We can not wait.

99
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,780
汽车人 变形 出发！
Autobots, transform and roll out!

100
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,760
威震天陛下！
Lord Megatron!

101
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,340
要是我们新出土的文物是霸天虎的
I certainly hope that our new acquisition is of Decepticon origin.

102
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,310
这不可能！
It cannot be.

103
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,850
如此强大的力量
Power of this magnitude

104
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,820
绝对不能落入擎天柱之手
must never be allowed to fall into the hands of Optimus Prime...

105
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,900
绝对不行！
No matter what.

106
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,460
给我…
Come here!

107
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,190
这岩石牢不可破！
The rock is impermeable!

108
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,100
遗物产生了一种保护层！
The relic is emanating a protective shield!

109
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,710
只有领袖之力能唤醒它！
It will only respond to the power of a Prime.

110
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,090
要带走它 我们就得移走整座山！
We will remove it if we have to take the entire mountain!

111
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,790
擎天柱 我又发现了另一个铁堡信号！
Optimus, I just picked up a second Iacon-locator beacon.

112
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,890
擎天柱 听到了吗？
Optimus, do you read?

113
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,530
没虎子的踪影！
No sign of Cons.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,280
哦 老兄 我老板要吓死了！
Oh, dude! My boss is gonna freak!

115
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,420
我们塞到他排气管里那玩意儿
That thing we stuffed in his tailpipe...

116
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,740
叫什么来着？
What's it called again?

117
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,940
披萨！
Pizza!

118
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,910
你们俩能小声点吗？
Will you two keep it down?

119
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,880
阿尔茜？隔板？有谁能听见我说话吗？
Arcee? Bulkhead? Can anyone hear me?

120
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,520
救护车 怎么回事？
Ratchet, what's going on?

121
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
探测器发现了另一个铁堡信号
Our sensors detected a second Iacon-locator beacon

122
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,740
但我联系不上擎天柱
but I can't reach Optimus.

123
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,930
我去
I'll go.

124
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,610
就你一个？
Alone?

125
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,980
你还有更好的选择吗？
You have a better option?

126
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,470
好吧！
Fine.

127
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,310
他虽然答应了
He says "fine"...

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,310
但看起来他并不想让我只身前往！
but I don't think he really wants me to go alone.

129
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,210
我好像被神子带坏了…
I... just pulled a "Miko".

130
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,400
有个遗物等着我们去拿！
Let's go grab a relic.

131
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,860
哇哦 是一把剑！
Whoa! It's a sword!

132
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,100
那不是普通的剑
Not just any sword.

133
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,210
看起来像是星辰剑！
That looks like the Star Saber

134
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,170
卓天越铸造的神兵利器！
a legendary weapon forged by Solus Prime...

135
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,900
这都是…民间传说
as lore would have it.

136
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,930
传说它能使用领导模块的力量
It's rumored to wield the power of the Matrix.

137
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,830
我要为擎天柱争光
I'm gonna make Optimus proud.

138
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,450
那不是个好主意
Not a good idea.

139
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,500
为什么？
Why?

140
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,950
因为威震天在这里
Because Megatron's here.

141
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,120
黑魔王本尊
The Dark Lord himself.

142
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,730
他不会想到是谁黑了他！
He won't know what hit him.

143
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,910
烟幕 等等 有点不对劲！
Smokescreen, wait. Something isn't right.

144
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,780
为什么威震天没有直接拿走星辰剑？
Why doesn't Megatron just take the Star Saber?

145
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,590
他有洁癖？
Germaphobe?

146
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,110
说真的 我们得等援兵！
Seriously, we need to wait for backup.

147
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
你知道救护车怎么说的 现在援兵来不了
You heard Ratchet. Backup's not available right now.

148
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,350
好了！
Enough!

149
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,520
开始运输！
Commence transport!

150
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,800
我的卡隆竞技场啊 那是谁？
Who in the pits of Kaon is that?

151
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,870
见鬼！
Scrap!

152
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,490
插得真紧！
It's really in there tight.

153
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,420
不！不该如此！
No! No, this can't be happening!

154
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,600
救护车 你得让擎天柱来这儿 烟幕去抢遗物了
Ratchet, you gotta get Optimus here now. Smokescreen went for the relic.

155
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,030
叫星辰…
I-it's called the "Star Sab..."

156
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,440
看在塞博特恩的份上 你在哪儿？
Where in the name of Cybertron are you?

157
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,780
还有你是不是提到星辰…？
And did you say "Star Sabe"?

158
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,680
我的天…
Oh, my...

159
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,560
杰克！
Jack!

160
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,150
擎天柱 请回答！
Optimus, please respond!

161
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,250
我知道你们还活着 擎天柱
I can see that you're alive, Optimus.

162
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,140
为什么不回答我？
Why won't you answer me?

163
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,950
噢 每当我们靠近时 信号就移动了！
Every time we get close to the beacon, the signal moves.

164
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,750
走了这么多脚程 我都手痒了
All this legwork is giving me itchy fists!

165
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,320
看来我们被霸天虎给耍了
It seems we have been led astray by a Decepticon trick.

166
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,590
出状况了！
We have a situation.

167
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,810
把他带过来！
Bring him to me.

168
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,470
你叫什么 汽车人？
What is your name, Autobot?

169
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,790
怎么？凭什么告诉你？
Why? Who wants to know?

170
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,340
擎天柱在哪儿？
Where's Optimus?!

171
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,590
别让擎天柱拿到遗物！
Keep Prime from the relic!

172
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,730
有我做你的后盾呢！
I got your back.

173
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,830
阿尔茜！
Arcee!

174
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,850
你到底在想些什么！
What could you possible have been thinking?!

175
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,090
肯定是被我弄松了！
I loosened it for him.

176
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,750
把山扔到他头上！
Drop the mountain on him.

177
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,470
擎天柱 退后！
Optimus, retreat!

178
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,920
快！
Now!

179
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,070
刚才他是不是…？
Did he just...

180
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,820
不可能！
No way.

181
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,270
这都行？
He can do that?

182
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,060
我们霸天虎…迎来了最黑暗的时刻
We Decepticons now face our darkest hour.

183
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,840
那简直帅呆了！
How epic was that!!

184
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,440
我亲视觉电路所见…
I-I saw it with my own optics.

185
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,660
…仍然难以置信
But I still don't believe it.

186
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,390
知道我最难以置信的是什么吗？
You know what I don't believe?

187
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,990
在反复叮嘱你之后
That after everything you've been told

188
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,920
你还是令一个人类陷入了危险
you still put a human at risk.

189
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,370
阿尔茜 那不是他的错 我本该…
A-Arcee, it wasn't his fault. I shouldn't have g...

190
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,840
别逼老娘发作 明天再跟你算帐
Don't you even start with me! We'll talk tomorrow!

191
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,490
送杰克回家！
Send Jack home.

192
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,590
绿灯行…
Green for "go".

193
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,780
我们的队伍需要的是一个成熟的汽车人
We've been in need of another Autobot in our ranks

194
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,190
而不是小屁孩！
not another child.

195
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,380
听着 阿尔茜 我又错了 很抱歉
Look, Arcee, I was wrong, and I'm sorry... again.

196
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,660
要是你想把我赶出领袖卫队…
And if you need to kick me off team Prime...

197
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,360
忽视人类的安全 抑或任何人的安全
Disregard for human safety... or anyone's safety...

198
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,890
都不容原谅 你明白了吗？
will not be tolerated. Do you understand?

199
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,450
完全明白 长官
Fully, sir.

200
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,770
我们决不能忘记 在这个星球上
We must never lose sight of the fact that upon this Earth

201
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:01,170
我们是巨人 而这种力量 必须谨慎使用
we are titans, and such power must be used wisely.

202
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,550
哇哦！
Whoa!

203
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,850
擎天柱 说句话
Optimus, speak to me!

204
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,280
擎天柱
Optimus!

205
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,960
我收到了一条信息
I am receiving a message.

206
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,320
谁发来的？
From who?

207
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,510
钛师傅…
Alpha Trion.
