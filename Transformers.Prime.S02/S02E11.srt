1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,850
骇翼 损伤报告？
Dreadwing. Damage report.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,440
所有重要系统都严重受损 威震天陛下
We have suffered critical damage to all major systems, lord Megatron.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,960
需要一段时间才能让飞船重新起飞
It will be some time before we can get the ship airborne.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,850
声波…
Soundwave.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,870
看来是一个汽车人弄坏了我的船
So it was an Autobot who crippled my vessel.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,810
他们必定会抓住我们的破绽 发起奇袭
They will move quickly to exploit any perceived weakness.

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,550
他们显然不会蠢到发动正面攻击吧 我的君王？
Surely they're not foolish enough to launch a direct assault, my liege.

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,380
自从我们上次见面后 擎天柱不再那么心慈手软了…
Optimus has grown decidedly more ruthless since our last encounter.

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,820
威震天陛下 作为您的医生
Lord Megatron, as your physician

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,110
对此我表示强烈反对
I strongly advice against this.

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,280
尽管黑暗能量的再生能力十分可观
Dark Energon's regenerative properties are impressive

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,810
但这副作用…
but the side effects...

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,400
我们无从得知它会对飞船造成什么伤害
there is no telling how it might impact the ship.

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,880
黑暗能量就在我身体中流淌
Dark Energon courses through my veins.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,410
把它输给战舰将使我能操纵战舰
Infusing the warship will enable me to manipulate the craft as if we are one.

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,440
我们合二为一 便可摧毁擎天柱
And together, we shall crush Optimus Prime.

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,220
那些机器昆虫突然退下了
But when the Insecticons suddenly backed off

18
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,640
我意识到我应该离动力核心很近
I got inspired by my proximity to the power core...

19
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,000
于是我发挥特长…
... and did what I do best.

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,100
你把威震天的飞船搞得一团糟 简直就像旅馆房间里的摇滚明星！
You trashed Megatron's ride like a rock star in a hotel room.

21
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,910
我们应该乘虚而入 发动进攻
We should hit the Cons right now while they're vulnerable.

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,020
尽管威震天的飞船迫降了
Megatron's warship may be grounded

23
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,410
但别忘了对手的人数是我们的几百倍
but let's not forget that we remain vastly outnumbered.

24
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,620
特别是他又把一窝虫子收入麾下…
Especially since he has added the insecticon hive to his ranks.

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,980
要不我呼叫空中打击吧
Then maybe it's time for me to call in an air strike.

26
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,300
或许我们应该考虑一些非常手段 福勒探员
Or for us to consider more extreme measures, Agent Fowler.

27
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,000
火种剥离器？
The Spark extractor?

28
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,370
擎天柱 你确定要这么做？
Optimus, are you certain you want to travel down this path?

29
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,530
虽然我十分不情愿动用这种武器
While I am deeply reluctant to deploy a weapon of this caliber

30
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,310
尤其是霸天虎设计的武器…
especially one forged by Decepticon hands

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,970
…但这或许是我们结束战争的唯一办法…
this may be our only chance to end the war

32
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,220
…一劳永逸
once and for all.

33
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,580
是的 我感觉得到！
Yes. I can feel it!

34
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,140
擎天柱 我在霸天虎的坠机处监测到一个巨大的能量信号！
Optimus, I'm detecting a massive energy spike at the Decepticon crash site.

35
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,660
那是黑暗能量
It appears to be dark Energon.

36
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,760
汽车人 变形出发！
Autobots, transform and roll out!

37
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,030
等等 擎天柱 既然你要使用超级武器\N来与霸天虎作最终决战
Hold on, Prime. If you are gonna deploy some kind of super weapon in the final showdown with the Cons

38
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,450
那么 我有义务代表地球人见证这一刻！
it's my job as a representative of planet Earth to bear witness.

39
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,070
我的自由女神像啊！
Sweet lady Liberty.

40
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,130
擎天柱 你从不辜负我的期待
Optimus, you never disappoint.

41
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,790
大黄蜂 趁现在！
Bumblebee, now.

42
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,000
阿尔茜 隔板 吸引火力！
Arcee, Bulkhead, draw their fire.

43
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,090
一旦启动火种剥离器
Once you launch the Spark extractor

44
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
立即撤出其有效半径
be sure to clear its radius before it can activate.

45
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,690
大黄蜂！
Bumblebee!

46
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,260
我来！
Mine!

47
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,670
我怎么不知道舰上配备了静止射线！
I didn't realize this ship was equipped with a stasis beam.

48
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,770
去斐济过圣诞节的愿望要泡汤了
So much for christmas in Fiji.

49
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,460
嗯？
Huh?

50
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,450
火种剥离器
The Spark extractor!

51
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,810
靠近点 让我取回本属于我的东西
Guide us closer so that I may collect what belongs to me

52
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,400
然后摧毁汽车人！
and destroy the Autobots.

53
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,970
作战失败 呼叫医疗救援
Team's down. Requesting medevac.

54
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,050
什么？你要去哪儿？我说靠近！
What?! Where are you going? I said closer!

55
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,190
威震天陛下 飞船看上去像在自动驾驶
Lord Megatron, the ship seems to be navigating itself.

56
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,090
手动操控！
Override.

57
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,350
系统不接受手动控制！
The system's are bypassing manual contr... ohhh!

58
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,390
看上去飞船有了自己的意识！
It appears the ship now possesses a will of its own.

59
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,940
不可能！
Impossible!

60
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,620
查出故障原因 然后修好它！
Trace the problem to its source and fix it!

61
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,330
不许篡改我的系统
Do not tamper with my systems!

62
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,390
我只警告一次！
This will be your only warning!

63
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,490
警告？！
Warning?!

64
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,890
我的任务优先执行
My mission assumes priority.

65
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,210
任何干扰我的塞博特恩人都将被摧毁…
Any Cybertronian who interferes will be neutralized.

66
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,180
我自己的飞船竟敢用威胁的口吻和我说话？
My own vessel dares to address me in threatening tones?!

67
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:13,610
而且它似乎比我们更擅长破译铁堡计划的数据库
It also seems to be doing a better job of decoding the project Iacon database than we were.

68
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,410
它已经又解出了一组坐标！
It's already deciphered a new set of coordinates.

69
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,140
按我们目前的航向推断
And judging by our current course

70
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,430
那正是战舰要去的地方
that is precisely where the ship is headed.

71
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,300
那正是我想要的 你看
As I desire. You see, 

72
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,190
这艘战舰不过是我个人意志的延伸
this warship is nothing more than an extension of my very will.

73
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,340
你的个人意志不值一提！
Your will is nothing.

74
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,860
铁堡的遗产将属于我！
The Iacon artifact will belong to me.

75
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,250
我是威震天陛下！我命令你停止运行！
I am Lord Megatron! I command you to cease operations!

76
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,240
你权威不再了
You are no longer in command.

77
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,490
不管用什么手段
Regain control of this vessel

78
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,370
夺回战舰的控制权！
by any means necessary.

79
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,570
全体船员 切断主能源
All hands, cut power to the mainframe

80
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,400
断开数据继电器 马上行动！
and disconnect data relays now!

81
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,380
他们还活着
They're alive.

82
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,860
但我从没遇到过这种类型的静止状态
But I've never encountered this form of stasis lock.

83
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,240
虎子们正在穿越大西洋！
The 'cons are crossing the Atlantic

84
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,470
沿着最短的路线前往北美地区！
making a beeline for North America.

85
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,190
等等 我们能追踪他们？
Wait. We can track them?

86
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,310
他们为什么没有照常开启隐形装置？
Why aren't they cloaked, like usual?

87
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,390
一切都太不正常了
None of this makes a lick of sense.

88
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,380
他们离我们近在咫尺 却转身飞走了！
They had us in their cross hairs, but the 'Cons just took off.

89
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,050
他们连火种剥离器都没拿！
They even bailed on that Spark extractor thingy.

90
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,770
如果飞船没有隐形
Well, if the ship isn't cloaked

91
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,820
或许通讯频道也开着 那么…
maybe the communications relay's open

92
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,160
怎么着 你的意思是咱干脆给老威打个电话
- and...\N- Yep, yep. Are you suggesting that we just call Megatron

93
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,990
问问他上面发生了什么？
and ask him what's happening up there?!

94
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,660
威震天陛下 计算机破解了另一个坐标
Lord Megatron, the computer has decrypted a second set of coordinates.

95
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,450
或许我们应该允许它继续…
Perhaps we should permit it to continue.

96
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,360
我不需要谁的准许
I do not require permission.

97
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,580
汽车人基地欧米伽一号呼叫霸天虎战舰！
Autobot outpost Omega One to Decepticon warship.

98
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,540
威震天 请回话
Megatron, please respond.

99
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,320
这场叛变到此为止了！
This mutiny ends now.

100
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,240
威震天
Megatron.

101
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,580
威震天已被革除了领导地位
Megatron has been relieved of his command.

102
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,640
你是谁？
Who is this?

103
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,310
你是谁！
Who is this?!

104
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,630
你控制了霸天虎战舰？
Have you taken control of the Decepticon vessel?

105
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,990
我就是战舰！
I am the vessel.

106
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,710
任何敢于干涉我任务的塞博特恩人都将被摧毁
Any Cybertronian who interferes with my mission will be neutralized.

107
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,350
什么任务？
What mission?

108
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,120
首要任务
Priority one

109
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,340
破译铁堡数据库 回收霸天虎科技
decrypt Iacon database and recover Decepticon technology.

110
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,670
为了什么目的？
For what purpose?

111
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,360
它挂机了？不礼貌！
It hung up? Rude.

112
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,100
岂止不礼貌？一艘巨大的战舰在四处游荡
Rude?! There's a giant spaceship flying around

113
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,170
搜集霸天虎的大规模杀伤性武器！
collecting Decepticon weapons of mass destruction!

114
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,480
这艘巨大战舰上的霸天虎都被消灭了
Wha... a giant spaceship filled with neutralized Decepticons.

115
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,380
什么意思？
Point?

116
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,060
这或许是我们登舰下载铁堡数据库的唯一机会
This could be our only chance to slip aboard and download the Iacon database.

117
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,330
这样擎天柱就能破译它！
So Optimus can decode it.

118
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,290
绝妙的主意 我会潜入霸天虎的飞船
Ingenious. I will infiltrate the Decepticon warship.

119
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,830
这样就不妙了 霸天虎是什么下场你都看到了
Not ingenious. You saw what it did to the Decepticons.

120
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,300
说不定威震天都难保！
And probably Megatron, too.

121
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,190
还有领袖卫队
And team Prime.

122
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,500
不过？那艘战舰明明可以置我于死地
But that tub had me dead to rights

123
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,820
我却保住了老命！
and I'm still breathing.

124
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,620
那艘船或许看不到人类
The ship may be blind to humans.

125
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
很好 福勒探员
Very well, Agent Fowler.

126
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,530
不过一旦有任何险情
But at the first sign of trouble

127
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,870
我会立即将你传送回来！
I am bridging you right back here.

128
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,560
现在 为了下载数据
Now, in order to download the database

129
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,340
你需要一个相匹配的传输磁盘
you will need a compatible transfer drive.

130
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,660
什么？
A what?

131
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,110
他还需要技术支持
He'll also need tech support.

132
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,420
还有后援！
And backup.

133
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,970
福勒呼叫基地 我们进来了
Fowler to base. We're in.

134
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,410
很好 任意一个控制台都可以访问数据核心
Good. Their data core should be accessible from any console.

135
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,720
这…这儿有一个！
H-here's one.

136
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,960
击倒被击倒了！
Doc Knock is knocked out.

137
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,160
看 战舰解出了两组铁堡坐标！
Look. The ship's decoded two sets of Iacon coordinates.

138
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,760
三个！咱们赶快拿了闪人
Three! Let's rip and run.

139
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,700
这里是接口！
There's the port.

140
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,380
嗯 为什么这艘战舰在飞向曼哈顿？
Um, why is the warship heading for Manhattan?

141
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,840
因为那里是第一组坐标锁定的地点？
Because that is where first set of coordinates are located.

142
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,340
塞博特恩的遗物怎么可能在美国纽约城？
What would a relic from Cybertron be doing in the Big Apple?

143
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,270
铁堡的圣物在很久以前失落到了地球上 福勒探员
The Iacon relics landed on Earth eons ago, Agent Fowler

144
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,590
远早于城市建立的时间
long before the city was built atop it.

145
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,980
也就是说战舰为了得到这个
Which means if the ship wants this one...

146
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,670
得推掉一些大楼
it may have to move some buildings out of the way.

147
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,300
我们的任务变得复杂了
Our mission just got complicated.

148
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,220
我们要怎么阻止战舰？
How do we deter this ship?

149
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,460
我建议销毁导航模块
I would advise disabling the navigation module.

150
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,320
调出主导航菜单！
Call up the main navigation menu.

151
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,140
那里！
There.

152
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
让开 孩子！
Step aside, son.

153
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
福勒探员？！
Agent Fowler!

154
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,190
发现系统访问
System access detected.

155
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,970
严禁任何干涉行为！
Interference will not be tolerated.

156
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,270
那边！
There.

157
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,120
快现身！
Reveal yourself.

158
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,290
它没有看到我们！
It doesn't see us.

159
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,110
暂时的！
Yet.

160
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,290
战舰没有扫描碳基生命体
The ship must not be scanning for carbon-based life-forms.

161
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,740
但是一旦它扩大搜索频率…
But once it widens its search parameters...

162
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,800
我们就完蛋了
We're toast.

163
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,910
我把你们传送回来！
I'm bridging you back.

164
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,550
不！纽约成千上万的生命正在生死关头
No. There are millions of lives at stake in New York

165
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,840
而我们三个是唯一可以阻止这件事的人
and we three are currently the only ones who can do anything about it.

166
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,540
别勉强自己 杰克
You're out of your element, Jack.

167
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,040
从读数上看 还有战舰恢复的速度
These readings, the ship's rapid recovery...

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,450
都说明威震天用了黑暗能量来修复它
all point to the fact that Megatron employed Dark Energon to repair it.

169
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,380
等等 如果说战舰是靠黑暗能量驱动的
Hold on. If you're saying the ship is fueled by dark Energon

170
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,280
那我们可以切断供给 不是吗？
we can dump it, right?

171
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,020
嗯…你们需要关闭战舰的能量注入器
You'll need to reserve the warship's Energon infuser.

172
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,660
顺着天花板上的主管道前进
Follow the main overhead conduits.

173
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,270
就能到达能量核心
They'll lead you to the power core.

174
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,090
威震天也准备这么干！
Megatron had the same idea.

175
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,800
这么说我们走对了
Then we're on the right track.

176
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,120
能量输出闸门只能手动操作
The Energon injection valve can only be operated manually.

177
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,710
手动？
- Manually?!\N- Manually?!\N- Manually?!

178
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,680
托我上去！
Give me a boost.

179
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,900
我被外星生命体入侵了！
I am infested with alien life-forms!

180
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,960
啊哦 我们完了！
Uh-Oh. We just got made.

181
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,810
清除一切寄生虫
All parasites will be eradicated!

182
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,050
嘿！这里！
Hey! Over here!

183
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,700
杰克 不！
Jack, no!

184
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,960
快跑！
Run for it!

185
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,420
太慢了！
Too slow!

186
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,040
动力严重不足
Critical power drain.

187
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,430
我…才是…老大！
I am... in... command.

188
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,170
准备…
Prepare to be...

189
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,210
受死…
neutralized.

190
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,100
快跑
Run.

191
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,960
感谢火种源
Thank the Allspark.

192
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,360
救护车
Ratchet!

193
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,420
开启环陆桥！
Fire up the Ground Bridge!

194
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,540
站稳了 士兵！
On your feet, soldier.

195
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,820
还有海狸还有海象还有鸭子还有老奶奶！
And beavers and ducks and walnuts and... grandma?

196
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,310
才下载了这么点？
That's all that's been downloaded?!

197
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,690
铁堡档案肯定很庞大！
The Iacon file must be huge!

198
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,970
太棒了！
Sa-weet!

199
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,150
快 我们快走！
Come on! Here's our ride!

200
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,320
杰克？
Jack?!

201
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,150
送福勒出去
Get Fowler out of here.

202
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,600
有一点总比什么都没有强
Some is better than nothing.

203
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,160
拿不到磁盘我是不会走的
I'm not leaving without that drive.

204
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,380
说“啊”
Say "ahh."

205
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,450
我来提点不同的诊断意见
I'm here to offer a second opinion.

206
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,070
威震天陛下 我…
Lord Megatron, I...

207
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,420
你让他们跑了！
You let them escape...

208
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,760
还带着重要的情报！
with vital intelgence.

209
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,560
尽管下载到的铁堡数据不完整
The download of the Iacon database may have been incomplete

210
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,680
但我们已经拥有了战舰所破译的四个坐标
but we now possess four sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

211
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,640
那我们必须得尽快行动
Then we must act quickly

212
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,360
因为威震天也有这四个坐标
for Megatron possesses the same four sets.

213
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:22,030
并且 他会毫不犹豫地夺取那里的超级武器…
And he will not hesitate to obtain the potential doomsday devices which lie at the site of each.
