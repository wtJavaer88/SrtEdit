1
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,050
欢迎回来 长官
Welcome back, sir.

2
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,950
你们做了什么？
What have you done?

3
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,940
为了挽救您的生命所必须做的 塞拉斯
What we needed to in order to save you, Silas.

4
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,970
我…成他们中的一员了！
I'm one of them.

5
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,300
借助生物科技实验的终极研究成果
The logical evolution of MECH's experiments and biotech.

6
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,900
您的大脑与捐赠者的神经和骨骼系统连接在了一起
Your brain fused with the donor's nervous and skeletal systems.

7
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,270
人类与机器的完美结合 如此精湛…
The perfect meld of man and machine. Exquisite.

8
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,550
感谢你们这一生为我所做的贡献
Thank you all for your dedication and a lifetime of service.

9
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:40,590
不过 我现在觉得自己更适合与那群巨人为伍了
But I now seem more suited to keep the exclusive company of titans.

10
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,400
我是莱兰・毕晓普上校
Colonel Leland Bishop.

11
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,660
隔板 你真的不能让自己这么衰弱下去
Bulkhead, you really mustn't allow yourself to decline.

12
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,950
对啊 小隔 你应该从沮丧中走出来！
Yeah, Bulk. You got to pull yourself out of this funk.

13
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,510
有什么用？
What's the use?

14
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,430
你真的需要加强体能
You need to regain your strength.

15
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,270
只要假以时日 你就能…
The time will come when...

16
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,520
能怎么样？帮上你们大家的忙？
When what? When all of you will need an assist?

17
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,220
那要新来的家伙干嘛？
Isn't that what the new guy's for?

18
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,460
嘿 隔板 我一直在想 考虑到你的伤势
Hey, Bulkhead, I've been thinking. With your injury and all

19
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,760
你不妨试试我从红蜘蛛那儿弄来的盔甲
you might want to take advantage of the armor I snagged from Starscream.

20
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,300
即穿即用的肌肉外套！
Instant muscle suit!

21
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,370
你认为我得去拄拐？
You think I need a crutch?!

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,790
隔板！那个我还有用呐！
Bulkhead, I needed that!

23
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,960
别挡道 新兵蛋子！
Out of my way, rookie!

24
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,910
他能走路了！
He can walk!

25
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,590
要我说 他完全可以执行任务了！
Looks like he's fit for duty to me.

26
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,550
你甚至都不知道自己在说什么
You don't even know what you're talking about.

27
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,600
你不是开玩笑吧 拉夫！
You've got to be kidding, Raf.

28
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,150
你这种模范学生 被禁足了？
You of all people grounded?

29
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,360
闹大了！我漏掉了一些作业 还搞砸了几门考试
Big time. I misplaced some homework and blew a couple of tests.

30
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,240
搞砸了是指：成绩从“A”变成了“A-”
Translation: "A-" instead of "A."

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,820
可能我耗在基地的时间过多了吧
I'm probably spending too much time at the base.

32
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,500
拉斐尔 我希望你没在那儿打电话
Rafael, I hope you're not on the phone in there.

33
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,100
没 妈妈 帮我跟小蜂打个招呼
No, mama! Say hello to Bee for me.

34
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,250
还有 在我的成绩提高之前 我没法呆在领袖卫队了
By time I improve these grades, I'm off team Prime.

35
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,760
好容易回来一个 立马又走了一个
Just when we get one back, we lose another.

36
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,770
奇怪啊
Strange.

37
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,070
威震天陛下 看起来打击的生命信号又出现了
Lord Megatron, it appears that Breakdown's signal has popped back online

38
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,270
尽管受到了污染
all be it corrupted.

39
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,870
谨慎前往调查 这很可能是汽车人的陷阱
Investigate with caution. It may well be an Autobot trick.

40
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,380
这是当然
I certainly hope not.

41
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,870
打击表面上是一只猛兽 但在旋转缓冲器下隐藏着一颗艺术家的心
Breakdown may act a brute, but he's a maestro behind a rotary buffer.

42
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
打击！这些日子你上…
Breakdown, where have you...

43
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,690
打击？谁欺负你了？
Breakdown, what happened to you?

44
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,920
这说来话长 而且威震天对这个一定更感兴趣！
There lies a tale which won't be nearly as interesting to Megatron as this.

45
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,780
所以 带我去见你的头目吧
So, take me to your leader.

46
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,690
下午4点30分时 一颗卫星从高安全等级的军需库中被盗
At 16:30 hours, a satellite was stolen from a high-security military bolt.

47
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,350
监控录像显示那个名叫打击的霸天虎离开过现场
Surveillance shows the Decepticon known as Breakdown at the scene.

48
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,070
有阵子没见过他了
Haven't seen him in a while.

49
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,620
似乎在打击以汽车形态进入基地的时候
It looks like Breakdown entered the base in vehicle mode

50
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,520
车上还有个人
with someone behind the wheel.

51
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,510
一个霸天虎和一个人类成双入对？
A Decepticon paired with a human?

52
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,460
此外我基本上猜出那人是谁了
And I have a pretty good hunch who.

53
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,950
被偷的卫星原属于达摩克利斯计划
The stolen satellite was project Damocles.

54
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,420
塞拉斯发明的东西
Invented by Silas.

55
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,600
我猜是前上校毕晓普想翻旧帐了
I guess the former Colonel Bishop wanted it back.

56
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,330
是啊 我还以为塞拉斯已经成过去式了！
Yeah, I thought Silas was paste!

57
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,170
包括我在内！
So did I.

58
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,540
福勒探员 就算他还活着
Agent Fowler, even if he were alive

59
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,500
你认为他能和霸天虎勾结在一起么？
are you suggesting that Silas has allied MECH with the Decepticons?

60
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,940
我极度怀疑威震天会考虑这个主意！
I highly doubt that Megatron would entertain such an idea.

61
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,010
为什么不呢？我们人机合作得就很不错嘛！
Why not? The human-bot alliance works for us.

62
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,630
大多数时候吧…
Most of the time.

63
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,020
击倒 这个令人作呕的东西是什么？
Knockout, what is this abomination?!

64
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,020
你竟然还把它带到这儿来？
And why have you brought it here?

65
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,720
我是塞拉斯 全称“增强型人机共存生命体”
I am Silas, as in cybernetic life augmented by symbiosis.

66
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,430
我来是有个提议
I come with a proposition.

67
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,340
这就是那个把打击解剖的人类！
This is the human who dissected Breakdown.

68
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
我的君王 请您允许我以牙还牙
Please, my liege, allow me to return the favor.

69
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:07,310
我建议您不要忽略一个让擎天柱占尽上风的资产 至少在这个星球上
I propose that you not overlook the one asset that provides Optimus Prime an advantage... at least, on this world.

70
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,270
你是指…
And that would be?

71
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,260
人类因素
The human factor.

72
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,260
看看你的周围吧 塞拉斯！
Look around you, Silas!

73
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,530
我统领着一支来自强大战舰上的军队
I command an army from a mighty warship.

74
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,430
相较之下 一个渺小的人类能为我提供什么？！
What could a human possibly offer?

75
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,550
我可不是普通的人类 这也并非普通的武器
I am no ordinary human, and this is no ordinary weapon.

76
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,280
达摩克利斯是一门粒子炮 它的力量足以把五角大楼像生日蛋糕一样切开
Damocles is a particle-beam cannon so powerful it can slice up the Pentagon like a birthday cake

77
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,680
从卫星轨道上用那东西 我能把拉什莫尔山的人都剃成莫霍克头
or give everyone on Mount Rushmore a mohawk, all from a satellite in orbit.

78
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,390
这是一个疯子的发明 还落在了威震天手里
It's the work of a madman. And in Megatron's hands...

79
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,310
一把利剑 高悬在这星球上每个人的头顶？
A threat to anyone, anywhere on the planet.

80
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,840
只需轻轻碰一下开关
With pinpoint accuracy at the flick of a switch.

81
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,840
那么你想要什么回报？
And what is it that you... wish in return?

82
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,010
只要能在您这里获得一席之地…
Merely a place at the table.

83
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,880
虎子们或许能夺取卫星 但没有接入密码就无法控制它
The Cons may have the satellite, but they can't use it without the interface code.

84
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,600
唯一的副本被保存在卡罗拉多州总部的安全服务器上
The only existing copy is stored on the secured servers at headquarters in Colorado.

85
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,600
我们必须不惜一切代价阻止霸天虎获得密码
We must keep the code out of Decepticon hands at all costs.

86
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,280
表演时间到了！
It's roll time.

87
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,800
那个…我还没说你能执行任务呢 更别说你现在根本没做好准备！
Ep, ep... ! I have not yet cleared you for active duty, nor are you ready to roll.

88
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,990
注意！所有人员紧急疏散
Attention, all personnel are ordered to evacuate immediately.

89
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,830
这里发生5级生化辐射泄露 重复 立即疏散！
We have a level 5 radiation leak. Repeat, evacuate immediately.

90
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,170
霸天虎捷足先登了！我们必须保护指挥中心！
The Decepticons have proceeded us. We must secure the command center.

91
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,500
汽车人也到了！
The Autobots have arrived.

92
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,290
威震天 放轻松！
Megatron, relax.

93
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,590
威震天…陛下
Lord Megatron.

94
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,100
声波或许需要下载密码 才能让您在战舰里直接遥控达摩克利斯
Soundwave may need to download the code in order to remotely operated Damocles from here on your warship

95
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,960
不过一旦侵入了中央处理器 他就能任意控制达摩克利斯了！
but while jacked into the mainframe, Damocles is his to command.

96
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,450
声波 准备进行测试！
Soundwave, prepare to beta test.

97
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,330
大有搞头啊…
Promising.

98
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
撤退！
Fall back!

99
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,760
救护车 请求支援！
Ratchet, we require backup.

100
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,410
马上就到！
- I'm there.\N- You can't yet!

101
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,000
你能按福勒探员的意见来远程关闭达摩克利斯吗？
Can you remotely disable project Damocles under Agent Fowler's advisement?

102
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,090
用人类的电脑网络？
On a human-based computer network

103
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,180
在缺少助手…缺少拉斐尔的情况下？
without my backup? Without Rafael?

104
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,270
你们干嘛来这儿？
Wha... what are you guys doing here?

105
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,940
孩子 地球母亲需要你
Son, your planet needs you.

106
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,760
汽车人 我们必须把它的注意力从拉斐尔那里引开
Autobots, we must draw its fire to distract from Rafael's efforts.

107
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,910
我倒觉得这完全不是问题
Somehow I don't think that'll be a problem.

108
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,100
救护车 你必须送我过去！
Ratchet, you've got to send me in.

109
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,400
好让你当个移动标靶？
So you can be an even easier target?

110
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,840
你现在连行动都不能自理
You have yet to regain your full range of motion!

111
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,290
可是打击回来了 他可是我的老冤家
But Breakdown's back. He's my archenemy.

112
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,750
拜托 连孩子们都在忙乎呢！
Come on, even the kids are in on the action!

113
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,560
好吧 隔板 你现在可以去执行任务了
Very well, Bulkhead. You are cleared for duty.

114
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,720
太好了！
Yes!

115
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,420
是我给你的任务！
A duty of my choosing.

116
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,750
我黑进去了 但我没法接触目标系统 防火墙太多了
I'm in, but I can't reach the targeting systems. Too many firewalls.

117
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,460
加油 孩子！要是虎子带着密码逃了
Come on, son. If the Cons make off with that interface code

118
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,330
达摩克利斯可就能全天候在天上开火了！
Damocles will light up the sky 24-7.

119
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,680
就让他们带走密码好了 反正那也没法帮他们使用卫星
Let them have the code. It won't do them any good without the satellite.

120
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,530
我没听明白
Can't say I follow you.

121
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,540
任何卫星都会有推进器 这是他们用来调整轨道的
All satellites have maneuvering thrusters so they can adjust their orbits.

122
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,800
如果我能黑进航行子程序 就能彻底关掉卫星
If I can break into the navigation subroutine, I can bring the whole satellite down.

123
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,590
好极了！顺便 呃…洗手间在哪儿？
Great. Say, um... which way is the bathroom?

124
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,560
什么？不！要是我妈妈看见你…
What? No! If my Mom sees you...

125
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,540
甭担心 叔叔可是在隐蔽行动中练过的
Relax. I trained in covert ops.

126
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,570
你就是被忍者训练过我也不管 我妈的眼睛无处不在
I don't care if you were trained by a ninja. My Mom has eyes in the back of your head!

127
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,910
有人入侵了系统？声波 我们有漏洞了！
An intruder in the system? Soundwave, we have a breach!

128
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,560
贾斯帕 内华达 那只可能是汽车人的人类同盟
Jasper, Nevada. It can only be the Autobots' human allies.

129
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,750
或许你可以把这件事处理一下！
Then perhaps you should attend to the matter.

130
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,790
显然您的部下更适合执行这个任务
Surely one of your subordinates is more suitable.

131
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,000
快去！
Now!

132
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,760
畅通无阻 我要上了！
Clear shot! I'm going in!

133
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,420
还是再议吧！
Scratch that.

134
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,080
晚上好 黑客
Good night, hacker.

135
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,930
我喜欢这支线任务 老救！
Good call on curbside duty, Ratch.

136
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,010
我想你想的拳头发痒 你跑哪儿去了 打击？
Been itching to trade pay with you again. Where you been, Breakdown?

137
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,470
别着急 我马上就送你去那边见他
Be patient. I'm about to send you there.

138
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,480
你不是打击？
You're not Breakdown.

139
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:54,470
但你是隔板 这是你最后一次干扰我的行动了
But you are Bulkhead, and this is the last time you'll interfere with one of my operations.

140
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,430
塞拉斯？
Silas?

141
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,870
在肉体上…从某种意义上来说
In the flesh, in a manner of speaking.

142
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,400
隔板你听到了吗？隔板！
Bulkhead, do you read? Bulkhead!

143
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,490
擎天柱 恐怕隔板需要紧急支援！
Optimus, I fear that Bulkhead requires immediate backup.

144
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,690
可恶 他们都把参数藏在哪儿了？
Oh, where did they hide the substringing?

145
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,400
我说 你家卫生纸不多了
FYI, you're low on T.P.

146
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,290
反应太慢了 你太依赖右拳了
Reaction time is slow. You're favoring your right side.

147
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,710
步法太乱
Legs are weak.

148
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,270
让你见识一下什么叫乱！
I'll show you weak.

149
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,940
你该躺在病床上的 汽车人
You should have stayed in bed, Autobot.

150
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,910
我来支援 这是新人该干的！
Assist... what the new guy's for.

151
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,240
听我这个老“新人”一言…
One new guy to another...

152
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,040
今天是你最后一次打卡了！
This is your final day on the job.

153
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,310
他们的意图是关闭卫星！
They're attempting to disable the satellite!

154
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,630
塞拉斯 砸扁一个人类小孩对你来说就那么难吗！
Silas, how difficult is it to squash a human child?!

155
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,730
塞拉斯！
Silas!

156
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,750
我们有密码了 直接瞄准黑客 消灭他！
We have the codes? Then target the intruder and destroy him!

157
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,300
我们的机会来了 汽车人 向指挥中心进攻！
This is our opportunity. Autobots, storm the command center.

158
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,110
就要成功了
I'm almost there.

159
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,780
干得好 拉夫！它动起来了！
Raf, rock on! It's moving.

160
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,630
呃 那不是我干的…
Uh, that isn't me.

161
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,700
啊 伙计们？那是贾斯帕
Uh, guys... that's Jasper.

162
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,810
哇唔 我能看到我监护人的房子！
Ooh, I can see my host parents' house.

163
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,950
而我能看到我家 就在目标范围内！
And I can see my house right in their target sights.

164
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,940
他们随时会开火 孩子！
Any time, son.

165
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,490
全力推进！
Full thruster burn.

166
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,490
你…你真是个天才！
Yes! You're a genius!

167
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,780
拉斐尔…？怎么这么吵 你到底在干什么？
Rafael. Jorge Gonzales Esquivel! What is going on in here?

168
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,360
学习研讨会！
Study group.

169
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,600
塞拉斯 立即返回基地！
Silas, return to base immediately.

170
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,310
看来某人的宏伟计划又一次泡了汤！
Looks like someone's big plan just burned up in re-entry.

171
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,460
说到雷霆救援队 我研究过你们的每一场战斗
And for the record, I studied every one of the Wrecker's battles.

172
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,520
你还是有希望入队的 新兵蛋子！
There's hope for you yet, newbie.

173
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,880
塞拉斯 你已经赢得了你的席位
Silas, you have earned your place at the table.

174
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,150
威震天陛下 这是我的荣幸
Lord Megatron, I am honored.

175
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,080
在击倒的解剖台上！
Knockout's dissection table.

176
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,970
打击会为此泉下有知的
Breakdown would be tickled.

177
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,960
不 威震天陛下 为什么？
No, lord Megatron. Why?

178
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,800
因为达摩克利斯是你所能提供的最好的东西
Because Damocles was the best you had to offer

179
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:56,210
而它现在已经没了 人类因素的确起到了决定性作用
and it is no more. The human factor did indeed tip the scales...

180
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,420
而获益者是我的敌人！
in favor of my enemies.

181
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,520
他会是个迷人的研究素材…
He will be a fascinating case for study.

182
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,960
我会好好研究他 一片纤维都不会落下…
I will leave no fiber or fiber optic unexamined.

183
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,240
不 不 威震天 我是来为您效忠的！
No, no. Megatron, I'm here to serve you!

184
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:32,890
不 不 不！！！
No! No! Nooo!
