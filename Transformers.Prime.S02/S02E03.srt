1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,150
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,080
由于领导模块的力量不再护佑他
With the power of the Matrix no longer within him...

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,380
理所当然的 他回到了成为领袖之前的状态：
It would stand to reason that Optimus has reverted to his pre-Prime state.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,220
一个高频信号…
A high-frequency signal...

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,930
内含一个加密的信息
With an embedded message.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,470
擎天柱在哪儿？
Where is Optimus?

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,480
除非你知道威震天把他的太空桥藏在何处…
Unless you know where Megatron is hiding his Space-bridge...

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,030
太空…桥！
Space... bridge!

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,850
…他们在没有我指导的情况下完成了？！
... They actually finished building it without my supervision?!

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,020
一旦我们控制了太空桥 就叫杰克过来
Once we secure the Space-bridge we'll send for Jack.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,460
你们三个还要撑足够长的时间
You three need to hold it long enough for Jack and me

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,380
直到我和杰克从塞博特恩回来
 to get to Cybertron and back.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,790
我怎么可能是擎天柱？
How could I possibly be "Optimus Prime"?

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,500
魔力神球的真实位置早就被神话跟谣传歪曲了 杰克
Vector Sigma's true location is shrouded in myth and rumor, Jack.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,130
传说领袖之路会通向那里
It is said the path of the Primes' leads there.

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,490
我们肯定很接近了
We must be close.

17
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,300
魔力神球…在下面？
Vector Sigma is... down here?

18
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,620
卡隆也不是一直都属于霸天虎
Kaon didn't always belong to the Decepticons.

19
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,660
威震天把它当做首都
Megatron took it as a capital.

20
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,960
显然他们没发现脚下藏着什么
Apparently without ever realising what lay beneath their feet.

21
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,560
阿尔茜！
Arcee!

22
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,470
我们正遭到某种…
We are being attacked by some kind of...

23
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,980
…巨型甲虫的攻击！
giant bot-beetle!

24
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,560
一个机器昆虫！
An Insecticon!

25
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,500
一个什么？
A what?

26
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,000
霸天虎在塞博特恩做什么？
What are Decepticons doing on Cybertron?

27
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,960
有几个留下来的 休眠在此
A few remained in stasis.

28
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,050
是看家的 以防止敌人突然造访
Sentries, should the enemy return.

29
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,850
杰克！走！
Jack! Go!

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
你当真吗？
Seriously?

31
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,750
离开阿尔茜？她是他的向导！
Without Arcee? She's his guide!

32
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,610
不 达比护士 阿尔茜是杰克的后援
No, nurse Darby, Arcee is Jack's backup.

33
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,580
钥匙芯片才是他的向导
The Key-Card is his guide.

34
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,310
快走啊！
Do it!

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,780
听她的 杰克
Listen to her, Jack.

36
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,910
你已经走到这一步了 擎天柱还指望着你呢
You've made it this far. Optimus is counting on you.

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,190
明白 妈妈
Roger that, Mom.

38
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,980
奥利安！
Orion!

39
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,980
你的“铁堡”计划有进展吗？
Have you made progess with project "Iacon"?

40
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,190
看起来我比想象的还要笨
It seems I am a bit rustier than I thought.

41
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,540
那是否和你喜欢做课外研究的天性有关？
Might that have anything to do with the nature of your after-hours research?

42
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,690
我是不是没提过我们会追踪你的动向？
Did I fail to mention that we would be tracking your activities?

43
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,900
为什么历史描绘中我跟汽车人的匪首是同一阵营？
Why does history portray me siding with the Autobot aggressors?

44
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,980
还有红蜘蛛为什么称我为领袖？
And why did Starscream call me a Prime?

45
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,020
我必须知道！
I must know!

46
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,560
我是谁？
Who am I?

47
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,670
你是我的手下
You are my clerk.

48
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
现在回去工作然后把数据库破译出来
Now get back to work and decode that database.

49
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,300
…不
... No.

50
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,360
我宁可把我的发现都删掉
I would rather erase my findings

51
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,920
也不给你拿去胡作非为
than make them available for your questionable use.

52
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,460
你真的以为我们没有追踪和记录\N你那些珍贵研究的点点滴滴吗？
Did you really think that we wouldn't be tracking and documenting every iota of your invaluable research?

53
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,240
我们留在塞博特恩的一个哨兵被激活了？
One of our sentries was activated, on Cybertron?

54
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,690
你跟我说我们的星球已经死了
You told me our planet was dead.

55
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,190
那不是重点 来人！
That is beside the point. Guards!

56
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,440
在我回来之前你就得完成“铁堡”计划
You will finish project "Iacon" by the time I return

57
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,750
否则我就让你亲眼看着我挖出你的火种！
or I will carve out your Spark before your very eyes!

58
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,110
活动记录显示我的太空桥定向到了塞博特恩…
The activity log indicates my Space-bridge was set for Cybertron...

59
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,430
…而且一直开着？
... and remains open?

60
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,250
汽车人如此大胆的冒险只有一个原因
The only possible reason the Autobots would take such a risk...

61
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,920
…为了让他们的宝贝擎天柱复原
... would be to restore their precious Optimus Prime.

62
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,170
各位 我进来了！
Hey everyone! I'm in.

63
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,840
太好了！
Sweet!

64
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,640
这就是…哇哦
This is... Wow.

65
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,350
开始下载了…我猜
Commencing download. ... I think.

66
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,280
就快了 擎天柱
Soon, Optimus.

67
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,240
没人让你停下来 派克斯
No one told you to stop, Pax.

68
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:43,370
我相信威震天打算用“铁堡”计划的\N成果来对付汽车人
I believe Megatron intends to use whatever he finds in project "Iacon" to harm the Autobots.

69
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,530
求你们了 我们得警告他们
Please. We can warn them.

70
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,370
这需要时间
This is taking awhile.

71
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,800
这是当然
Of course it is.

72
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,250
这可是历代领袖的智慧结晶
We are talking about the collective wisdom of the Primes.

73
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,240
怎么了 杰克？
What is it, Jack?

74
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,820
吸屑虫
Scraplets!

75
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,600
吸屑虫是什么？
What's a scraplet?

76
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,000
为什么偏偏是吸屑虫！
Why did it have to be scraplets?!

77
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,250
如果它们在领导模块完全重启之前咬穿魔力神球…
If they chew through Vector Sigma before the Matrix fully reloads...

78
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,110
那么说…魔力神球并不只是传说
So Vector Sigma is more than legend.

79
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,460
你们汽车人拯救首领的举动真是令人印象深刻
You Autobots have gone to impressive lengths to recover your Leader.

80
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,630
请相信…我决不会再低估你们了
Be assured, I shall never underestimate you again.

81
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:21,050
现在… 我猜那个叫阿尔茜的\N正拿着重启的领导模块从那个隧道中走过来
Now... I assume the one called Arcee will be stepping through that portal with the reloaded Matrix of Leadership in hand.

82
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,880
我们得不惜一切代价守住太空桥！
We hold the Space-bridge at all costs!

83
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,510
给我滚下去 铁桶头！
You're going down, Bucket-head!

84
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,460
杰克？
Jack?

85
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,470
哦 不 不 现在可别失灵！
Oh no-no-no-no, don't quit now!

86
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,150
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

87
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,040
给我退回去 虫子！
Back off, bug!

88
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,470
嘿 伙计们 主菜来了！
Hey, guys! The main course!

89
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,480
领导模块搞定！
I have the Matrix.

90
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,750
我们快走
Let's roll.

91
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,550
你必须承认
You have to admit

92
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,700
践踏汽车人的前任领袖也让人倍感殊荣
it's a privilege to stomp the former leader of the Autobots.

93
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,360
别 请…住手
No, please... stop.

94
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,270
够了！
Enough!

95
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,820
我…有武器？
I'm... armed?

96
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,310
我们就快到了
We're almost there.

97
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,750
救护车 我们搞定了领导模块
Ratchet, we have the Matrix.

98
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,190
我们正赶过来
We're coming through.

99
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,830
救护车？
Ratchet?

100
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,330
有点不对劲
Something's wrong.

101
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,830
我们无论如何也得过去 不是吗？
We can’t... not go through, can we?

102
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,010
来啊 阿尔茜
Come, Arcee.

103
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,300
来让我终结这领袖的传承
So that I might end the lineage of the Primes for all time.

104
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,080
我决不允许 威震天
I cannot allow that to happen, Megatron.

105
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,660
你这是狗拿耗子 奥利安・派克斯
And why should you care, Orion Pax?

106
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,240
你又不是领袖
You are no Prime.

107
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,740
也许这是事实 也许又是另一个谎言？
That may be true. Or yet another deception?

108
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,730
不过有一点我很明白：
But this much I do know:

109
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,230
我对汽车人有认同感 而你不是我们当中的一员
my sympathies lie with the Autobots and you are not one of us.

110
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,940
也许你的火种真的找准了位置 奥利安
Your Spark may be in the right place, Orion.

111
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,810
不过你要是想跟我过招 那还早着呢
But you have much to learn before you can hope to ever again stand your ground against me.

112
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,330
很遗憾 那一天不会来临的
A moment, sadly, which shall never come.

113
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,770
你…确定我配得上？
Are you... certain I am worthy?

114
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,750
你不了解自己的伟大
You have no idea.

115
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,960
很高兴你能加入这温馨的大团圆
How nice of you to join our little reunion.

116
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,040
现在 你可否交出…
Now, if you please...

117
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,910
领导模块？！
the Matrix?!

118
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,980
不！
Noo!

119
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,180
威震天…
Megatron...

120
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,470
退下！
Be gone!

121
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,740
救护车！我们怎么会来到这里？
Ratchet! How did we arrive here?

122
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,600
说来话长 老朋友
Long story, old friend.

123
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,980
基地呼叫阿尔茜！
Base to Arcee!

124
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,650
我们检测到下面有五个汽车人的生命信号
We're reading five Autobot life signals down there.

125
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,080
擎天柱跟你们在一起吗？
Is Prime with you?

126
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,170
还有杰克
And Jack.

127
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,090
好哎！
Yes!

128
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,650
啊！
Ah!

129
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,980
是接我们的！
It's ours!

130
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,210
汽车人 返回基地！
Autobots, fall back!

131
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,680
这一次 他可不会跟你走了！
This time he's coming with us.

132
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,880
杰克！
Jack!

133
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,330
擎天柱？
Optimus?

134
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,380
你好 拉斐尔
Hello, Rafael.

135
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,490
- 哇！\N- 老大记起咱们了！
- Woah.\N- The Big Guy remembers us! Woo-hoo!

136
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,630
虽然好像有些事情我记不起来了
Although it seems there is much I do not remember.

137
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,070
擎天柱 我们度过了最黑暗的时刻
Optimus. It has truly been our darkest hour.

138
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,910
但同时
But know this:

139
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,220
种种迹象表明 你的火种
from every indication your Spark 

140
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,320
从未抛弃过汽车人的理想
never ceased being that of an Autobot.
