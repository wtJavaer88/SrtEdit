1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,040
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers: Prime

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,740
擎天柱回到了成为领袖之前的状态：\N奥利安・派克斯
Optimus has reverted to his pre-Prime state: Orion Pax.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,370
钥匙芯片！它是做什么用的？
The Key-card! What does it do?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,060
用来启动魔力神球
It grants access to Vector Sigma

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,850
它是一种神秘力量的古老源泉
an ancient source of mystical power.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
在塞博特恩
On Cybertron.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,000
当我们在塞博特恩内战中取得优势之时 我们占领了铁堡的档案馆
When we stormed the Iacon Hall of Records in the winning days of the war for Cybertron

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,590
从那里得到了一些高度机密文件
we acquired highly classified files

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,820
我们无法破译
which we were not able to decipher.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,880
是虎子！
It's 'Cons!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,250
他们又闯进了两个月前他们袭击过的军用实验室
And they're busting into the same military research lab they hit two months ago.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,500
我们让他们造好太空桥
We let them finish building their Space-bridge.

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,490
为什么？
Why?

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,100
好让我们去接管它
So we can commandeer it.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,350
用它把我送到塞博特恩去
And use it to send me to Cybertron.

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,650
但我却没在船上看到他
I have not seen him aboard the ship.

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,560
红蜘蛛指挥官已经牺牲了
Commander Starscream is dead.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,930
擎天柱？
Optimus Prime?!

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,280
别这样！
Please!

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,700
我没有恶意！
I mean no harm!

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,940
哦！那你在这里做什么？！
Oh! Then what are you doing here?!

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,550
为威震天陛下进行调查
Research. For Lord Megatron.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,620
你在拿我寻开心吗？
Is this some kind of joke?

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,630
我…不明白
I... do not understand.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,830
还有你为什么叫我擎天柱？
And why did you call me "Optimus Prime"?

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,220
为什么不能叫？
Why wouldn't I?

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,430
因为我的名字是奥里安・派克斯
Because my name is Orion Pax.

28
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,240
我离当领袖还差得远呢
I am far from being a Prime.

29
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,430
你让我想起了一个老相识 就是这样
You reminded me of someone I once knew. That's all.

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,960
你是红蜘蛛
You are Starscream.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,460
…是的
...Yes.

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,310
威震天陛下告诉我你已经…光荣捐躯了
Lord Megatron told me you had been... terminated.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,070
威震天陛下说话一向不太靠谱
Lord Megatron says many things, only some of which are true.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,330
你…不会是在暗示我们的首领说谎吧？
You... do not suggest that our leader would speak falsehoods?

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,330
你不会真的被蒙在鼓里了吧？
You truly are being kept in the dark, aren't you?

36
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,010
你的话着实令我费解 红蜘蛛
You speak in many riddles, Starscream.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
请告诉我你都知道些什么
Please, tell me what it is that you know.

38
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,440
作为回报…
And in return...

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,470
投降吧！红蜘蛛！
Starscream! Surrender!

40
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,960
别开枪！
Hold your fire!

41
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,830
老实呆在实验室里
Remain in the lab.

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,430
但是我…
But I...

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,560
这是威震天陛下的命令
Lord Megatron's orders.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,830
拉斐尔！实验对象都准备好了么？
Rafael! Is the test subject ready?

45
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,970
完毕！
Check!

46
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,110
远程GPS已启动
Long-range GPS activated.

47
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,550
不知二次校准能否将其成功地延伸至环陆桥范围
I have doubts whether my recalibrations have successfully  extended Ground-bridge range.

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,490
只有一种方法来验证
But there's only one way to find out.

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,540
来吧！
Come on!

50
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,320
这只不过是首次测试
It was just the first try...

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,980
不 拉斐尔 这太蠢了
No, Rafael. It was pure folly.

52
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,260
这是绝望下的荒唐之举
A misguided act of desperation.

53
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,660
掌握太空桥工程需要花费一辈子的时间
It takes eons to master Space-bridge engineering.

54
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,040
没有人比霸天虎更了解它…
And no one is more accomplished than the Decepticons...

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,470
你知道么 这就像在体育课上爬绳子
You know, there is this thing in gym class where you have to climb a rope.

56
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,210
要一直爬到上面
All the way to the ceiling.

57
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,890
这真的很难
It's really hard.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,660
我从未成功过
And I've never been able to do it.

59
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,040
不过…
But...

60
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,510
当我告诉小蜂的时候
When I told Bee about it

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,820
他相信我能行
he believed in me.

62
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,320
在鼓励之下 我反复地练习
Which made me practice a ton.

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,140
最终 仅仅几周之后
Finally, just a couple of weeks ago

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,950
我成功地爬上去了
I made it! To the top.

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,600
这和体育课有关系么？
What does any of this have to do with gym class?!

66
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,370
我…我只是…
I... I was just...

67
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,870
让你一个人静静吧
I'll give you some alone time.

68
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,960
擎天柱…我很抱歉
Optimus... I am so sorry.

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
奥利安
Orion.

70
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,750
我对最近的骚动表示抱歉
I am so sorry for the recent commotion.

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,370
你没有受伤吧？
You weren't in any way harmed, were you?

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,230
没有 威震天陛下
No, Lord Megatron.

73
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,650
但你为什么对我说红蜘蛛死了？
But why did you tell me Starscream was dead?

74
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,960
因为他不再追寻我们的事业了
Because he is dead to our cause.

75
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,480
红蜘蛛曾是我最信任的副官
Starscream was my most trusted lieutenant.

76
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,400
直到他成为叛徒 加入了汽车人
Until he turned traitor and joined the Autobots.

77
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,720
这是我经历过的最刻骨铭心的背叛
Never have I witnessed a more profound act of deceit.

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,340
他没对你说什么蛊惑人心的言论吧？
He did not do or say anything troubling to you?

79
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,360
没有
No.

80
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,550
这就好
Good.

81
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,450
最好忘记这些琐事
Perhaps it's best to forget the entire incident

82
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,580
回到工作上吧
and return to your project.

83
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,620
遵命 我的陛下
As you wish, my Lord.

84
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,060
奥利安永远都不会懂得欺骗的艺术
Orion was never very adept at the art of deception.

85
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,980
我犯了一个错误 没能当机立断地宰了红蜘蛛
I made a mistake not terminating Starscream when I had the opportunity.

86
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,340
这是我绝不会再犯的错误！
A mistake I do not intend to make again!

87
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,850
没有能量的迹象
No sign of energon spikes.

88
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,600
阿尔茜和小蜂找到太空桥了么？
Arcee or Bee find the Space-bridge?

89
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,500
他们还没有什么消息
They haven't yet reported back.

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,220
救护车 你还好么？
Ratchet. You alright?

91
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,700
嗯？我很好！
Hm? Yes!

92
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,940
好 我们进行下一步行动
Yes. Let's just get you to the next quadrant.

93
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,260
这是什么？
What is it?

94
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,250
一个高频信号
A high-frequency signal.

95
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,830
内含一个加密的信息
With an embedded message!

96
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,990
…给我的
... for me.

97
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
是擎天柱？
Optimus?

98
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,870
是红蜘蛛
Starscream.

99
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,340
我得到了关于你们领袖的情报
"I have obtained information regarding your Leader.

100
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,910
带上医疗箱 一个人来
Bring medical kit. Come alone".

101
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,090
我告诉过你要一个人来！
I told you to come alone!

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,480
我们什么时候开始非得听你的了？
And since when do we listen to you?

103
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,450
擎天柱在哪儿？
Where is Optimus?

104
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,670
把我修好 或许我会告诉你
Patch me up and perhaps I'll tell you.

105
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,360
发发慈悲吧 我的能量在泄漏！
Have sympathy. I'm leaking here!

106
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,150
那你就快说
Then I suggest that you speak quickly!

107
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,770
擎天柱有没有受到伤害？！
Has Optimus been harmed in any way?!

108
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,900
他很好 非常好！
He's fine. Fine!

109
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,790
你没看见我才是被伤害的那一个么？
Can't you see I'm the one who's been harmed?

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,740
他在哪儿？！
Where is he?!

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,130
那你认为他还能在哪儿？！
Where do you think?!

112
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,190
当然在威震天的战舰上！
He's on Megatron's warship!

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,190
具体位置呢？
Which is located Where?

114
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,660
哼…啊 现在谁知道
Ha... ha. Now, who knows?

115
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,010
那是艘飞船！会动！
It's a ship! It moves.

116
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,760
我追踪了它几个月换来的只有这一身的枪子
It took me months to track only to get fired upon.

117
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,080
你不会自讨麻烦叫我来的
You wouldn't go to the trouble of calling me here

118
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
除非你有可以用来交换的情报
unless you had information to trade.

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,170
…真正的情报！
... real information!

120
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,220
很好…
Very well...

121
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,710
你挚爱的领袖丧失了自我意识
Your beloved Leader may have lost his senses.

122
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,490
他现在是奥利安・派克斯
He goes by the name "Orion Pax" now.

123
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,700
看起来威震天让他相信自己成了一个霸天虎！
And it seems Megatron has led him to believe he's a Decepticon.

124
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,270
说些我们不知道的吧
Tell us something we don't know.

125
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,210
什么？！
What?!

126
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,470
你们怎么知道这些的？！
How could you possibly know that?!

127
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,600
我们在浪费时间
We are wasting our time.

128
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,560
等等！这是我知道的全部了！真的！
Wait. That's all I have! Really!

129
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,170
你不能把我扔在这里！
You can't just leave me like this!

130
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,870
除非你知道威震天把他的太空桥藏在何处
Unless you know where Megatron is hiding his Space-bridge

131
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,290
不然你就留在这里等着生锈吧
you can stay here and rust.

132
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
太空桥…
Space-bridge...

133
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,910
你的意思是说\N他们在没有我指导的情况下完成了？！
Do you mean to tell me that they actually finished building it without my supervision?!

134
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,930
…这才是最戳我痛处的地方 医生
... it hurts most right here, Doctor.

135
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,450
霸天虎的太空桥就在这里
The Decepticons' Space-bridge is located right here.

136
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,020
在一个能量矿的深处
Deep within an Energon mine.

137
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,480
紧靠原始能量供给 很聪明
Adjacent to a raw fuel supply. Clever.

138
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,920
哪里来的消息
What's our intel?

139
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,840
一个…可靠的来源
A... reliable source.

140
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,510
那么！我们达成共识了么？
So! Do we have a consensus?

141
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,090
你知道人类能在那里的大气层下呼吸么？
Do we know if people can even breathe your atmosphere?

142
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,680
这个我能帮杰克
I'll back Jack up.

143
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,230
搞到最先进的宇航服
Completely, state of the art.

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,490
我在国家航天局有熟人
I still have connections at NASA.

145
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,320
这太危险了
It's too dangerous.

146
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,700
妈妈 我知道这很困难
Mom. I know that this is hard.

147
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,640
但擎天柱冒着生命危险来拯救我们的星球
But Optimus risked his life to save our planet.

148
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,660
他甚至不是人类 我们欠他的
And he's not even human. We owe it to him.

149
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,230
杰克可能是唯一能做到的人 琼
Jack may be the only one who can do this, June.

150
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,130
但不要误会 我不会让杰克孤身前往的
But I don't want you to think for one moment that I'll allow him to travel unchaperoned.

151
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,220
不是每个人都注定平凡一生
Not everyone is destined for an ordinary life.

152
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,480
擎天柱以前也不过是奥利安・派克斯
Optimus Prime was once Orion Pax, after all.

153
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
小时候你一直希望能当个宇航员
When you were little, you always wanted to be an astronaut.

154
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,550
好吧 擎天柱
Okay. "Optimus Prime".

155
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,880
擎天柱 汽车人侵略者的匪首
"Optimus Prime. Leader of the Autobot invaders."

156
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,800
红蜘蛛看到我时想到了他？
I reminded Starscream of him?

157
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,480
而威震天陛下说救护车才是汽车人的领袖
And Lord Megatron said Ratchet was the Autobot leader.

158
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,380
…有人在说谎
... someone is not telling the truth.

159
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,400
我们将用环陆桥到达能量矿
We will ground-bridge directly in to the energon mine

160
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,290
杀出一条通往控制室的路
and make our way to the Space-bridge chamber

161
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,360
扫清遇到的一切霸天虎障碍
neutralize any Decepticon forces we encounter.

162
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,440
一旦我们控制了太空桥
Once we secure the Space-bridge

163
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,270
就叫杰克过来
we'll send for Jack.

164
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,270
行动必须绝对隐秘
Stealth must be an absolute priority.

165
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
我们很可能寡不敌众
We will most certainly be outnumbered

166
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,160
如果有一个霸天虎向战舰报了信…
and if any Decepticon should transmit an alert to their warship...

167
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,010
就会变成四百比一的局面
The odds become four hundred to one.

168
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,400
就这一点而言
Scrambling communications upon entry

169
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,370
干扰通讯系统会为我们的行动提高胜算
will certainly provide an edge in this regard.

170
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,180
占领太空桥还不是最难的
Taking the Bridge is the easy part.

171
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,370
你们三个还要撑足够长的时间
You three need to hold it long enough for Jack and me

172
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,060
直到我和杰克从塞博特恩回来
 to get to Cybertron and back.

173
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,510
拉斐尔在体育课上能爬到绳子的顶端 我们也能行
Rafael climbed to the top of the rope in gym class - we can do this.

174
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,220
这和体育课有关系吗？
What does gym class has to do with anything?

175
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,110
如果救护车要搞突袭
And if Ratchet gets to go on a commando raid

176
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,420
我也去
I'm going too.

177
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,110
神子 你能帮助拉斐尔操作我们的环陆桥
Miko. You will help Rafael operate our Ground-bridge

178
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,070
以及管理通信枢纽
and manage the communications hub.

179
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,340
不能去塞博特恩！
Can't go to Cybertron.

180
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,770
又不能占领霸天虎的太空桥！
Can't storm the Decepticon Space-bridge!

181
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,940
达比护士随时待命以应对紧急状况
And nurse Darby will stand-by in case of emergency.

182
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,130
孩子？
Son?

183
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,670
该整装出发了
It's time to suit up.

184
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,220
无异常
Clear.

185
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,410
无异常
Clear.

186
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,580
总部！这里是太空桥控制中心
Command! This is Space-bridge control.

187
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,940
我们被袭击了！
We are under attack!

188
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,010
总部！你们收…？
Command! Do you copy...

189
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,480
下去吧
Going down.

190
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,170
我的火种源啊
By the Allspark!

191
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,780
谢了 红蜘蛛
Thank you, Starscream.

192
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,220
除了他还有谁
Who else would it be?

193
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,090
工程学上的杰作…
A masterpiece of engineering...

194
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,460
能操作吗？
Operational?

195
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,100
能
Fully.

196
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,430
该区域已经占领
Perimeter secured.

197
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,530
现在是最可怕的部分
Now the scary part.

198
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,560
我关闭了干扰器来保持通信以便完成任务
I'm shutting down the scrambler in order to contact base and maintain communications through the remainder of the mission.

199
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,050
突击小队呼叫基地
Strike team to base.

200
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,990
目标已得手
Objective secured.

201
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,660
该你上场了
That’s your cue.

202
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,540
给我带个纪念品回来
Bring me back a souvenir.

203
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,590
那个…你如果要去洗手间可怎么办？
Sooo... what happens when you have to go to the bathroom?

204
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,380
注意安全 孩子
Safe journey, son.

205
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,070
放心…去吧
Just... go already.

206
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,860
擎天柱需要你
Optimus needs you.

207
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,600
锁定塞博特恩
Locking onto Cybertron.

208
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,120
准备好了么？
You ready?

209
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,830
开始吧
Let's do this.

210
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,140
为避免信息延迟我会一直让太空桥保持开启
I'll leave the Space-bridge portal open in order to eliminate any communication lag over the great distance.

211
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,450
也为了你们在回来的时候更容易定位
And make it easier for you to locate when you're ready to return.

212
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,710
容易定位？
Easier to locate?

213
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,670
你不是要用太空桥把我们直接送到魔力神球那里吗？
You're not bridging us straight to the Big V?

214
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,430
魔力神球的真实位置早就被神话跟谣传歪曲了 杰克
Vector Sigma's true location is shrouded in myth and rumour, Jack.

215
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,130
传说领袖之路会通向那里
It is said that the path of the Primes leads there.

216
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,420
我们要坚信擎天柱会引导你的
We must be confident that Optimus will guide you.

217
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,770
别担心 太空桥和环陆桥没什么大的区别
Don't worry. Space-bridging is just like Ground-bridging.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
就是稍微有点刺激
Just a little more intense!

219
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,620
我…我真不敢相信
I... I can't believe it!

220
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,750
我竟然在另一个星球上
I am actually on another planet.

221
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,710
阿尔茜 这太难以置信了！
Arcee, this is incredible!

222
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,760
阿尔茜？
Arcee?

223
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,840
我不想让你看到我的家乡是这番景象
This isn't how I wanted you to see my home.

224
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,390
我…我很抱歉
I'm... I'm sorry.

225
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,640
在战争的迷雾中我们只能看到下一个任务
In the fog of war it is hard to see beyond the next leg of the mission

226
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,760
或者下一场战斗 难有远见卓识
or the next punch in the fight.

227
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,260
我们竭尽全力只为挽救塞博特恩
We did everything to save Cybertron.

228
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,740
当迷雾散去时…
But when the fog finally lifted...

229
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,780
已经剩不下什么可挽救的了
There wasn't much left to save.

230
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,330
阿尔茜！杰克！你收到了么？
Arcee! Jack! Do you copy?

231
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,740
救护车 我们在塞博特恩上
Roger. We're on Cybertron.

232
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,360
- 好哇！\N- 呀哈！
- Yes!\N- Woo-hoo!

233
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,020
感谢上帝！
Oh, thank goodness!

234
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,870
别只顾着观光 呃？
Just keep the sightseeing to a minimum, huh.

235
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,040
没错 我们不知道要走5公里还是500公里
Indeed. We don't know if your journey ahead is 5 kliks or 5000.

236
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,080
明白
Understood.

237
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,360
我们出发吧
We're out.

238
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,440
好吧 救护车说钥匙芯片会引导我 但是…
Okay. Ratchet said the Card would guide us, but...

239
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,630
我不知道如何 或是怎样去…
I don't see how or what I'm supposed to...

240
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,390
就去那边
There you go.

241
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,870
这得好一阵子呢
This could be awhile.

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,770
太空桥控制中心 你收到了吗？
Space-Bridge Control, do you read me?

243
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,260
太空桥控制中心 我是打击
Space-bridge control, this is Breakdown.

244
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,510
你没有按时汇报情况
Your status report is overdue.

245
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,830
糟了
Scrap.

246
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,650
隔板 别 他会认出你的声音
Bulkhead, no! He'll recognize your voice.

247
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,350
我能把频率变低
I can make it lower.

248
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,290
或是调高呢?
Higher?

249
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,900
他也会认出我的
He would recognize mine as well.

250
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,810
回话 太空桥控制中心！
Come in, Space-bridge Control!

251
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,370
别逼我下去爆了你的气缸
Don't make me come down and dent some engine blocks.

252
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,410
有人得说点什么 要快！
Somebody say something, pronto!

253
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,550
拉斐尔！让福勒探员上
Rafael! Patch in Agent Fowler.

254
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,140
你有一微循环的时间来报告 不然…
You have one nanocycle to respond or!..

255
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,310
这里是太空桥控制中心 一切正常
This is Space-bridge Control. Situation normal.

256
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,760
正常？你确定？
Normal? You sure about that?

257
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,440
我们就是…校准了一下系统 我们还…
We were just... calibrating the subsystems and we, uh

258
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,580
呃 有点小问题 但现在好了
had a surge, but it's fine now.

259
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,470
你那边好么？
How are you?

260
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,770
呃 嗯…再好不过了！
Er, erm... Never better!

261
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,810
我知道在下面干活不容易
I know it’s thankless down there.

262
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,450
好好干吧
Keep up the good work. Huh?

263
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,370
我们会的 通话结束
Will do. Control out.

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,710
为什么霸天虎档案馆的加密如此复杂
Why would the Decepticon archive be so heavily encrypted?

265
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,120
我怎么可能是擎天柱？
How could I possibly be "Optimus Prime"?

266
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,050
就算是我们层层加密也无法让他远离真相
Even our encryptions couldn't keep him from the truth!

267
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,990
奥利安还有许多任务 他会坚持到底的！
Orion has much to accomplish and he will stay the course!

268
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,250
哪怕我得给他施加巨大的痛苦也要完成铁堡计划！
Even if I must inflict great pain to ensure the completion of project "Iacon"!

269
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,920
这边走
That way.

270
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,430
去卡隆？
Toward Kaon?

271
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,990
霸天虎的首都 好极了
The Decepticon capital. Swell.

272
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,820
我们从这里开始步行
We're on foot from here.

273
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,540
我不想让引擎声招来不必要的注意
Don’t want engine noise to attract the wrong kind of attention.

274
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,560
虎子？
'Cons?

275
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,570
害虫
Vermin.

276
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,920
这边走
This way.
