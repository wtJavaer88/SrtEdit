1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,060
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,740
卓天越之锤？
The Forge of Solus Prime.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,720
别让我后悔今天的选择！
Do not ever make me regret which one of you I spared.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,320
将太空桥指向塞博特恩！
Target the space bridge for Cybertron.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,870
仅仅挥舞了几下锤子 砰的一下！
A few swings of that hammer, and bam.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,600
环陆桥就变成太空桥了
Our ground bridge is now a space bridge.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,040
威震天已经发现“终极之锁”在塞博特恩了
Megatron has discovered that the Omega lock is on Cybertron.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,840
必须阻止威震天 不惜一切代价！
Megatron must be stopped, no matter the cost.

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,990
汽车人已经抢走了“终极之钥”
The Autobots have seized  the Omega keys.

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,290
我们已经找到“终极之锁”了
We have located the Omega lock.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,660
汽车人 我建议你们把钥匙交给我
Autobots, I would suggest that you hand over those keys.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,060
如果我们拒绝呢？
And if we refuse?

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,780
我们就可以看着他们一起…痛苦地死去！
We can all watch them instantly perish together.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,850
这可不是我所期望的首次塞星之旅…
Not how I wanted to spend my first trip to Cybertron.

15
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,610
红蜘蛛！
Starscream.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,400
小杰克 出来陪叔叔玩玩？
Jack, it's time to come out and play.

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,140
有种就杀了我
Go ahead.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,750
汽车人愿意为拯救我的星球而牺牲
The Autobots were prepared to sacrifice themselves for my planet.

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,220
我也愿意以死相报！
I'll do the me for theirs.

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,000
我也是！死变态！
Me too, creepy.

21
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,500
或许该让他们得偿所愿？
Perhaps we should oblige them.

22
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,820
倘若我的抉择 葬送了汽车人在塞博特恩的未来
If my decision dooms the future of the Autobot cause on Cybertron

23
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,180
那也只能坦然接受
so be it.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,610
但我决不会弃人类盟友于不顾
But I will never forsake our human allies.

25
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,780
现在 如果愿意的话
Now, if you please

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,750
“终极之钥”…
the Omega Keys.

27
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,860
一次换一个
One at a time.

28
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,830
你先来 大个子
You first, big boy.

29
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,210
回头这东西要是打不开 我就让你把钥匙咽下去！
If I don't get the girl, I'll make you eat this key.

30
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,180
甭客气
You're welcome.

31
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,020
去你渣的！
Get scrapped.

32
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,930
如果这个小子重要到连领导模块都值得托付
If this human was important enough to entrust with the Matrix of Leadership

33
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,990
那么他也值得两块钥匙
he's worth two Omega keys.

34
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,980
别耍花样！
No tricks.

35
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,400
交出钥匙…
The keys, if you please.

36
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,980
擎天柱 成功了吗？
Optimus, were you successful?

37
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,070
救护车？
Ratchet?

38
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,430
是琼・达比
It's Joan Darby.

39
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,240
你好吗？
How are you?

40
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,670
呃…我很忙 达比夫人
I'm... Eh... Busy, miss Darby.

41
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,120
我正亟待汽车人的消息
I am expecting urgent news from the Autobots.

42
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,020
哦…杰克和他们在一起吗？
Oh. Is Jack with them?

43
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,400
不 怎么了？
No. Why?

44
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,010
我一整天没见他了
I haven't seen him all day

45
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,470
打电话也不接
and he isn't returning my calls.

46
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,110
我一有他的消息就让他联系你
I will have Jack contact you immediately should I hear from him.

47
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,940
请你原谅 我必须保持通讯链畅通
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must keep the comm lines clear.

48
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,060
救护车？喂？
Ratchet? Hello?

49
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,100
现在 见证塞博特恩新时代的开启吧！
Now bear witness as a new era dawns on Cybertron.

50
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,750
看啊 霸天虎的纪元降临了！
Behold! The age of the Decepticons!

51
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,500
火种源在上…
By the Allspark.

52
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,530
- 哇哦！\N- 哇哦！
- Whoa.\N- Whoa.

53
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,560
瞬间恢复原状了…
Instant home makeover.

54
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,600
焕然一新呐！
Shiny.

55
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,170
你已得偿所愿 威震天
You have what you want, Megatron.

56
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,080
这场战争属于汽车人和霸天虎
This conflict is between Autobots and Decepticons.

57
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,390
让我送人类回地球
Allow me to return the humans to Earth.

58
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,960
哦…我不建议这样做
Oh, I wouldn't recommend it.

59
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,340
他们在这儿要安全得多
They'll be far safer here.

60
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,370
太空桥已锁定目标了吗？
Is the space bridge locked on target?

61
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,440
正如您指示的 威震天陛下
Per your instructions, Lord Megatron.

62
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,040
好极了
Excellent.

63
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,700
既然我能统治两个世界…
Why rule only one world

64
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,820
何必只满足一个？
when I could rule two?

65
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,080
不！
No.

66
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,180
嘿 我是杰克
Hey, it's Jack.

67
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,880
我正忙着拯救世界 暂时无法接听！
I can't answer 'cause I probably out saving the world right now.

68
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,590
擎天柱 你听到了吗？
Optimus, do you read?

69
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,680
一个出现在大气层的未知能量柱干扰了系统
An unknown energy spike in Earth's atmosphere is crashing all my systems.

70
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,130
千万告诉我这和终极之锁被激活有关…
Please tell me this is related to the activation of the Omega lock.

71
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,810
既然终极之锁可以让塞博特恩复苏
If the Omega lock can restore Cybertron

72
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,930
那用在地球上也一样 对吧？
it'll do the same to Earth, right?

73
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,630
不
No.

74
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,420
它会将你的星球数字化 以便于适应新的模块
It will cyber-form your planet in favor of its new matrix...

75
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,960
并随之毁灭所有地球生物
destroying all indigenous life in the process.

76
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,550
多么原始的力量啊！
Such raw power!

77
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,880
我该如何命名新的领地？
What should I call my new domain?

78
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,440
新卡隆？或是…“死”球？
New Kaon? Or perhaps "Gilded Earth".

79
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,870
不！
No!

80
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,170
别碰我们的星球！
Leave our planet alone!

81
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,210
擎天柱 你能听到吗？
Optimus, can you read?

82
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,410
救护车…请打开太空桥
Ratchet, please open a space bridge.

83
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,920
我猜…咱们得取消归乡派对了
I guess we should cancel the welcome-home party.

84
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,200
快去照看我们的主人
Attend to our master!

85
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,360
他需要医治！
He requires medical attention!

86
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,790
擎天柱！
Prime!

87
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,200
他放任塞博特恩死去沉沦 徒留躯壳 我要他付出代价！
He will pay for dooming Cybertron to remain a lifeless husk!

88
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:45,650
哈哈哈哈哈！
Hahaha...

89
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,610
他们可以逃走
They can run

90
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,260
但再也无家可归了！
but they can never again run home.

91
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,160
孩子们？
The children!

92
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,730
发生什么事了？
What happened?

93
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,580
你们到是说两句啊！
Somebody say something!

94
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,880
擎天柱…毁了终极之锁
Optimus destroyed the Omega lock.

95
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,380
什么？！
What?!

96
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,430
你干了…
You did...

97
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,020
我别无选择
What was necessary.

98
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,500
当时地球危在旦夕
There was no time for another prolonged battle

99
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,120
没时间从容作战了
not with Earth in imminent danger.

100
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:30,510
于是你毁掉了…全宇宙中\N唯一能让我们家园复苏的东西？
So you destroyed the only device in any universe capable of restoring our home?

101
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,110
擎天柱…那个我们还有用啊
Optimus, we needed that.

102
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,660
你当时不在场 大夫
You weren't there, Doc.

103
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,730
你没资格去评论战场上的决定
And it's not your place to second-guess a battlefield decision.

104
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,160
我当然有资格！
It most certainly is!

105
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,860
一定有其他办法的！
There had to be another way!

106
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,410
事情并非那么简单 救护车
I-It wasn't that simple, Ratchet.

107
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,640
威震天当时用终极之锁攻击地球！
Megatron was using the Omega lock to attack the Earth.

108
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,450
擎天柱拯救了我们的星球！
Optimus saved our planet.

109
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,590
那我们的星球呢？！
What about our planet?!

110
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,740
挥洒了无数的能量
All of our struggles and energon spilled

111
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,650
牺牲了无数的战友
countless sacrifices

112
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,960
到头来却一场空？
for nothing?!

113
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,730
木已成舟 多说无用
Right decision or wrong, what's done is done.

114
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,300
我们又有新麻烦了
And we have another problem here on this world.

115
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,180
虎子们把杰克 神子和拉夫牵扯进来 他们已经不择手段了
The Cons just changed the rules when they put Jack, Miko, and Raf into play.

116
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,480
擎天柱！
Prime!

117
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,980
五角大楼已进入了一级战备
The Pentagon's preparing to go Defcon 1.

118
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,130
我需要知道咱们到底遇上了什么麻烦！
I need to know what we're dealing with!

119
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,350
你指什么 福勒探员？
To what do you refer, Agent Fowler?

120
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,760
你应该去户外亲自看看
Maybe you should step outside and see for yourselves.

121
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,080
救护车 看好孩子们
Ratchet, watch the children.

122
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,710
威震天已经完成了数字化地球的第一阶段
Megatron has managed to accomplish the first phase of his cyber-forming of Earth...

123
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,820
建造他的堡垒
the construction of his fortress.

124
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,690
在贾斯帕 内华达？
In Jasper, nevada?

125
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,820
我不明白
I don't get it.

126
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,020
我都把小镇给疏散了
I've already had the town evacuated.

127
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,160
他们干嘛要建在这儿？
Why here?

128
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,920
因为霸天虎已经发现了我们基地的位置…
Because the Decepticons have discovered the location of our base.

129
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,430
如今 我们痛失了让塞博特恩复苏的机会
Our opportunity to revive Cybertron has been lost

130
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,170
一切皆因擎天柱的背叛！
due to the treachery of Optimus Prime!

131
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,110
但从这里 从新卡隆城的堡垒开始
But from our fortress of New Kaon

132
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,630
我们将征服这个世界！
we will instead seize control of this world!

133
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,770
霸天虎 变形 起飞！
Decepticons, transform and rise up!

134
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,990
我等这一天很久了！
I thought he'd never ask!

135
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,420
上吧 我的大军！
Come, my armada!

136
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,100
攻击！攻击！再攻击！
Attack! Attack! Attack!

137
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,270
汽车人 撤回基地！
Autobots, into the base!

138
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,870
福勒 你在做什么？
Fowler, what are you doing?

139
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,230
尽我的本职
My job, two-ton.

140
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,380
发生什么事了？
What's happening?

141
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,050
外面怎么了？
What is going on out there?

142
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,060
霸天虎正大举进攻贾斯帕
The Decepticons have invaded Jasper.

143
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,910
福勒似乎认为他能阻止他们！
And Fowler seems to think he can hold them off.

144
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,000
特工福勒呼叫防空指挥部
Special Agent Fowler to air-defense command.

145
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,030
我需要紧急战斗支援
I need immediate combat support.

146
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,550
快呀 防空指挥部！
Come on, air-defense command.

147
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,280
一箭三雕
I'll be triple-dipped.

148
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,030
擎天柱
Prime

149
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,750
增援部队到了！
reinforcements just arrived.

150
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,710
福勒探员 你们的军事力量不足以对抗…
Agent Fowler, your military cannot prevail against the...

151
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,550
你们不会以为我会让你们独自享乐吧？
You didn't think I was gonna let team Prime have all the fun, did you?

152
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,440
哈哈 是老千！
Haha. It's Jackie!

153
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,860
千斤顶！你是怎么…？
Wheeljack? But how did you...

154
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,930
循着奇怪的能量波动来的
I picked up a strange energy surge.

155
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,510
不介意哥们掺一脚吧
Hope you don't mind the company.

156
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,120
不 只是经过那些事情之后…
No. It's just that after everything... well...

157
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,610
咱们仍然是队友 大夫 永远都是
We're still on the same team, Doc. Always will be.

158
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,300
救护车 将所有的人 准备进行转移
Ratchet, prepare to bridge everyone out of here.

159
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,910
你要放弃基地？
We're abandoning the base?

160
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,210
基地已经沦陷了
The base is lost.

161
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,010
千斤顶和福勒只是在争取时间让我们撤离
Wheeljack and Agent Fowler can only buy us time to escape.

162
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,000
大黄蜂 拉斐尔
Bumblebee, Rafael

163
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,810
你们先走
you will depart first.

164
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,260
我们分头走？
You're splitting us up?

165
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,460
我们不该一起行动吗？
Shouldn't we stick together?

166
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,460
团结一心？
All for one and one for all?

167
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,040
我们只有分散开才能成功突围
We must disperse to avoid capture

168
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,030
在下次重聚并有能力发动反击之前
until we can regroup and launch a counterattack.

169
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,900
我们的首要目标是活下去
Survival is our only priority now.

170
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,970
想炸死我 你们还早一百…
The day I'm outflown by a bunch of toasters is the day I...

171
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,870
我们没时间了
We haven't much time.

172
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,010
琼？
Joan!

173
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,610
去死吧！
You're scrap.

174
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,200
看谁能来救你 雷霆救援队！
And that's how you wreck a Wrecker.

175
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,050
哈哈哈哈
Hahahahahaha.

176
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,180
你呢？
What about you?

177
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,080
我留下断后 确保没有霸天虎尾随
I will ensure that the Decepticons cannot follow.

178
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,870
我从没想过一切就这样结束了
I... never imagined it would end like this.

179
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,650
我也一样 老朋友
Neither did I, old friend.

180
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,770
不…
No...

181
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,000
这里就是他们的基地
This is the place, all right?

182
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,900
这里“曾”是他们的基地
This was the place.

183
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,330
团结一致 我们赢了
United we stand

184
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,020
一盘散沙 他们输了
divided they fall.
