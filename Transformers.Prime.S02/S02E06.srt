1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,140
擎天柱！
Prime!

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,260
你们的人到底在搞啥名堂？
What in blazes are your people doing out here?!

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,540
我们可是有协议的 不许伤及无辜
We had an agreement. "No collateral damage".

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,410
很抱歉 福勒探员 可我担保全体汽车人都在这里 
I am sorry, Agent Fowler. But all Autobots are present and accounted for.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,540
那这又是怎么回事 距奥马哈市20英里的地方 两个傻大个儿正打得不可开交
Then explain why I'm receiving reports of two jumbo-size bots mixing it up twenty miles outside Omaha?

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,740
霸天虎？
Decepticons?

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,770
他们最近起了内讧 看来威震天的队伍也不好带了
There's has been plenty of infighting lately. Megatron can't seem to keep his ranks in line.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,050
我刚好赶到 给你们看看
Well, I'm just arriving on the scene. Have a look.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,670
我搞不懂 抛开涂装不说 那家伙不可能是天震
I don't know. Paintjob aside, it can't be Skyquake. 

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,990
你和擎天柱不是把他干掉了么？
You and Optimus pounded him into the ground.

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,650
后来红蜘蛛把他弄活了 只不过成了一只僵尸
Before Starscream yanked him back out. As some kind of undead terrorcon.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,910
还有个问题 跟他互掐的人又是谁？
The question still stands: who is the dance partner?

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,780
火种源在上 是我们的人！
By the Allspark! It is one of ours!

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,330
千斤顶！
Wheeljack!

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,410
哈哈 老千回来了！
Ha-ha, Jackie's back!!

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,720
就算亚伯拉罕・林肯回来了又怎样
I don't care if Abraham Lincoln's back!

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,720
得想办法控制局势 否则我们全都会上11点的新闻！
We have to contain the situation before we all wind up on the eleven o'clock news!

18
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,140
你无路可逃了 虎子！
You've got nowhere left to run, Con!

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,080
这里是福勒探员 在…
This is special agent Fowler of --

20
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,720
哇！冷静点 愣头青！我跟你是一伙的！
whoa! Stand down, hot-head! I'm on your side!

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
就知道他们要来凑热闹
Had a feeling the gang might show.

22
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,200
老千！
Jackie!

23
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,900
就它了
That will do.

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,880
啊！又是这套把戏！
Ah! Not this again!

25
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,260
别想跑
Oh no you don't!

26
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,780
千斤顶！
Wheeljack!

27
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,030
老千！别！
Jackie! No!

28
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,930
骇翼把这个地方给炸飞了
Dreadwing rigged the place to blow.

29
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,510
骇翼？
Dreadwing?

30
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,370
其实这是你的杰作吧 猛男
Actually, it was your handiwork, sparky.

31
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,680
这里是一个加油站
It's called a gas station.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,810
类似于能量补给站 不能在这里进行交火
Kinda like an energon depot. Doesn't mix well with blaster fire.

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,520
哼 那只虎子逃掉了
Huh. Well, our Con is getting away.

34
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,460
千斤顶 在这个星球上
Wheeljack. There are other considerations.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,580
需要注意的地方还有很多
While upon this world

36
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,710
你最好服从我的指挥
you would do well to follow my lead.

37
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,720
噢！轻点 医生
Ow! Take it easy, Doc.

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,930
这条胳膊我还要呢
I need that arm.

39
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,410
想要的话就别乱动
Hold still and maybe you'll keep it.

40
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,950
我说 指挥官
Look, Commander.

41
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,870
很抱歉我放了一只大号烟花 我保证不会再犯了
Apologies for fireworks. Won't happen again.

42
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,600
不过 我已经跟踪骇翼有上百光年了
But I've tracked Dreadwing across a hundred light-years of space!

43
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,250
我以为你在银河系流浪
I thought you were roving the Galaxy...

44
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:16,880
是为了…
You know...

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,120
搜寻汽车人的幸存者
looking for Autobot refugees?

46
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,470
我就是那么做的 然后我找到了一个
I was. Until I found one...

47
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,470
雷霆救援队员
A Wrecker.

48
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,510
谁？
Who?!

49
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,100
浪花
... Seaspray.

50
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,800
哈！那个老家伙怎么样了？
Ha! ... How is old Barnacle Butt?

51
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,800
不怎么样 小隔 其实他已经粉身碎骨了
Not so good, Bulk. Blown to bits, actually.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,900
什么？不会吧…
What? No...

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,550
骇翼…
Dreadwing.

54
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,260
（Jackhammer 钻击号 本意是手提钻 \NG1元祖漫画中是纽约市一个摔跤手的名字)
My flier, the "Jackhammer"

55
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,790
收到了几光年外 由浪花发自德雷昂的信号
picked up Seaspray's signal a couple of light-years from Maderan.

56
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,520
我们彼此联络之后 约定了见面地点在多米顿星系
We made contact and arranged a rendezvous in the Dromedon system.

57
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,660
但是骇翼肯定是截获了通信
But Dreadwing must have intercepted the transmission.

58
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,040
因为他先对浪花下了手
'cause he got to Seaspray first.

59
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,390
一颗感应雷
Proximity bomb.

60
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,930
想把我们两个同时干掉
Supposed to take us both out.

61
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,550
我应该庆幸钻击号足够结实
Guess I should be glad that Jackhammer can take a punch.

62
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,020
我发现了骇翼的离子尾迹 为了逮住他 我足足追击了十几个星系
I picked up the Dreadwing's ion trail and tracked it through a dozen solar systems before catching up with him.

63
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,380
而他正好将我带回到这颗蓝宝石
And he led me right back to this marble.

64
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,050
宇宙真小啊 嗯…
Some coincidence, huh.

65
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,760
我了解骇翼
I know of this Dreadwing.

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,120
他是追踪者部队的指挥官
He was Captain of a Seeker armada.

67
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,030
和他的孪生兄弟天震一样
And as such -- like his twin Skyquake

68
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,240
都是霸天虎事业的忠实狂热分子
-- fiercely loyal to the Decepticon cause.

69
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,100
毫无疑问 骇翼是奔地球来的 为了向他唯一真正的主人效忠
Dreadwing has no doubt travelled to Earth to pay allegiance to his one true master...

70
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,630
祝他观光愉快
Hope he's enjoying the visit.

71
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,270
这里将会是他旅途的终点
It's gonna be his last.

72
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,370
千斤顶
Wheeljack!

73
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,650
这颗星球大部分地区都居住着智慧生命体
This planet is heavily inhabited.

74
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,370
任何对霸天虎的军事打击都要慎重考虑
Any strike we make against the Decepticons must be carefully measured

75
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,030
作为一个团队 我们不能冒危及人类的危险
as a team, lest we risk endangering the human population.

76
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,880
那你是建议我们在这里坐以待毙？
Are you suggesting we sit back and do nothing?

77
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,910
你 这个桀骜不驯的家伙
You! Loose cannon!

78
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,690
你的莽撞行为差点暴露了我们
Your cowboy antics almost blew our cover!

79
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,040
- 暴露？\N- 我们在地球上得伪装起来 老千
- Cover?\N- We're robots in disguise, Jackie.

80
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,760
在基地外 你需要一个地球上的车辆形态
You needed an Earth-based vehicle mode outside of here.

81
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,950
你打下的那艘太空船
That spaceship you shot down.

82
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,100
可不是地球款式的
Not Earth-based!

83
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,490
我费了很大劲才把那架飞行器清理干净
I had to jump through some big hoops to get it hauled out of plain sight.

84
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,130
你得把你的人看紧点 擎天柱
You need to keep a tighter leash on your people, Prime!

85
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,970
看紧点？
A tighter leash?

86
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,290
我得说个明白 小东西
Let me clarify, tiny.

87
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,590
老千…
Jackie!

88
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,540
我不是给擎天柱打下手的
I'm not one of Optimus Prime's people.

89
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,870
我去和他谈一谈
I'll talk to him. Err... 

90
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,240
如果你允许的话
with your permission.

91
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,780
当然可以
Of course.

92
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,610
看来 这个新来的有些蔑视权威
So. The new guy has a little problem with authority.

93
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,840
千斤顶和隔板曾在雷霆救援队中共事
Wheeljack and Bulkhead served together in the Wreckers.

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,350
那是一支独立于常规指挥体系的部队
A combat unit that operated outside the normal chain of command.

95
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,560
哦 兵痞子
Hm. Black ops.

96
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,630
他们执行的任务通常无人愿意接手\N而他们当中的很多人都已殒命沙场
They accepted missions no one else would.\NAnd many of them did not come back.

97
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,450
威震天陛下
Lord Megatron.

98
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,250
我誓死效忠于您
I live to serve.

99
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,840
平身 骇翼
Rise, Dreadwing.

100
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,560
你们兄弟二人的忠诚无人可及
Loyalty such as yours is a rare commodity.

101
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,380
我的忠诚发自于内心
Mine runs deep and true.

102
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,860
当然 驱使我前来这里的不仅仅是忠诚
Yet it is not loyalty alone brought me here.

103
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,150
嗯？
Oh?

104
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,610
我是来确认我尊兄的死的
I seek confirmation of the demise of one whom I considered a brother.

105
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,950
你怎么知道他阵亡了？
How did you learn of his passing?

106
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,510
我们孪生兄弟共享着一个分离的火种
My twin and I shared a split-Spark.

107
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,320
因此两个人的身体结构完全相同
Our metal are but two halves of the same life-force.

108
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,840
即使我和他相隔着一个银河系\N我也能感受到他在这行星上的一举一动
Even across the Galaxy I sensed when he emerged from stasis on this planet.

109
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,820
他的火种已不复…
And when his Spark was no more.

110
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,250
的确
It is true.

111
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,220
天震死于汽车人之手
Skyquake perished at the hands of the Autobots.

112
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,640
虽然这不是我的责任
Though not, in fact, under my watch.

113
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,480
所以 作为回报
Then by the Pit

114
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,860
这颗该死星球上的所有汽车人 都要给他陪葬
every last Autobot on this accursed world will pay.

115
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,410
当时机成熟时 汽车人会为他们所犯下的罪行付出代价
The Autobots WILL be punished for their crime and many others how and when I see fit.

116
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,160
但是主人！
But Master!

117
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,020
争辩只会扰乱计划 带来失败！
Conflicting agendas will only result in chaos. And failure.

118
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,430
你最好记住 骇翼
You would be wise to remember that, Dreadwing.

119
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,690
你现在是在我手下办事
You are under my command now, and as such, 

120
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,200
必须服从我的指挥
you must follow my lead.

121
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,890
老千 你看
Jacky. Look.

122
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,180
如果没有人类的帮助
Even if it weren't for the humans

123
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,190
我们是无法与虎子们相抗衡的
we couldn't take on the Cons right now.

124
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,430
敌众我寡
We're outnumbered.

125
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,680
路霸 烈火 撞针 旋暴 浪花…
Roadbuster, Pyro, Impactor, Rotorstorm, Seaspray...

126
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,800
他们都死了！
all dust.

127
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,360
那正是我想说的
That's what I'm talking about.

128
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,570
无论是雷霆救援队还是汽车人
Wreckers are Autobots.

129
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,470
都已所剩无几
There just aren't that many of us left.

130
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,250
不过在擎天柱的领导下
But if we get behind Optimus

131
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,430
我们有机会结束这一切 彻底结束
we have a chance to end this. Once and for all.

132
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,860
像擎天柱这样的人 都是嘴上说的好听
Guys like Optimus, they talk a good game

133
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,650
一旦你成了一堆废铁 他们甚至不愿弄脏他们的手
but when you're in the scrap they don't want to get their hands dirty.

134
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,420
哇哦 哇哦 哇哦
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

135
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,500
你不像我这般了解擎天柱
You don't know Optimus like I do.

136
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,420
我曾认为雷霆救援队员的身份是我的一切
Being a Wrecker meant everything to me

137
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,820
但我最终想通了
but I left that behind--

138
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,600
因为领袖才是最实在的 接着忽悠
-- because Prime was the real thing, blah-blah-blah.

139
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,870
千斤顶 我知道你听得到 我有一个提议
Wheeljack. I know you are out there, listening. I have  a proposition for you.

140
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,640
那是谁？
Is that?

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,970
骇翼！
Dreadwing.

142
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,180
如果你有火种的话 到这个坐标处见我
Meet me at these coordinates. If you have the Spark.

143
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,960
我这就去见你 虎子 只为去看你被电得外焦里嫩
I'll see you there, Con. Just to watch you fry.

144
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,500
老千 这是个陷阱！
Jacky, it's a trap.

145
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,270
我知道 是陷阱又怎么样？
I know. But when has that ever stopped me?

146
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,170
你一起来吗？
You coming with?

147
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,880
至少让我去叫后援
At least let me call for backup.

148
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,350
你知道的 雷霆救援队从来不叫后援
You know Wreckers don't call for backup--

149
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,920
他们只叫人清理敌骸
- They call for clean up!\N- They call for clean up!

150
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,050
我真没想到你会来
I wasn't certain you'd come.

151
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,490
我做事不喜欢半途而废
I don't like unfinished business.

152
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,030
就这点儿能耐？
That all you've got?

153
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,640
如果你想从这里飞出去
If you're thinking about flying out of here...

154
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,020
那可打错主意了！
Think again.

155
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,070
隔板！
Bulkhead!

156
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,150
隔板的信号显示他离这里有一千公里远 
Bulkhead's signal. Over a thousand miles from here. 

157
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,960
我估计千斤顶和他在一起
And I would have to imagine that Wheeljack is with him.

158
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,920
你试过联系他吗？
Have you attempted contact?

159
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,900
没有回应
No response.

160
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,090
怎么这么慢 小隔？
What took you so long, Bulk?

161
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,440
别告诉我跟了擎天柱之后让你…
Don't tell me riding with Prime has made you...

162
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,280
变弱了？
... soft?

163
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,720
你听不听我的指挥是一回事
If you will not take orders from me, that is one thing.

164
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,090
但如果你让我手下的汽车人身处险境…
But when you place one of my Autobots in danger...

165
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,200
恕我直言 长官 隔板很清楚这其中的风险 
With all due respect, sir, Bulkhead knew the risks. 

166
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,540
每名救援队员都有这觉悟
Every Wrecker does.

167
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,090
我肯定他就在这堆石头下面
And I'm sure he's just somewhere in this rubble.

168
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,320
擎天柱 隔板的信号已经不在你现在的位置了
Optimus! Bulkhead's signal has moved from your current position.

169
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,890
你要一起来吗？
You coming with?

170
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,600
你和隔板是老相识了 你却喜欢只身独行
You and Bulkhead share quite a history. And yet you prefer to work alone.

171
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,720
雷霆救援队很久以前就失散了 
The Wreckers scattered a long time ago. 

172
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,720
并且单独行动更有效率
And alone is usually a lot less complicated.

173
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,670
我们离居民区很近 要记住…
We are close to population. Remember.

174
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,720
不能朝汽油开火
Blasters and fuel pumps don't mix.

175
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,090
我们的大男孩就在前面
Our boy is just up ahead.

176
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,950
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

177
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,690
见鬼…
... Scrap.

178
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,980
这次你真要把自己变成一堆废渣了 伙计！
You really got yourself in a heap of scrap this time, partner.

179
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,630
离远点 老千
Stay back, Jackie!

180
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,940
最好赶快进行拆除
Better get to work.

181
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,290
你以前拆过炸弹吗？
Have you defused one of these before?

182
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,170
双保险 假铅芯 各种陷阱… 简直是艺术品
Failsafes... dummy leads... booby traps. It's a work of art.

183
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,400
骇翼 你在哪里？
Dreadwing. Where are you?

184
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,050
做我应做的事情 威震天陛下
Merely pursuing my destiny, Lord Megatron.

185
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,680
我不是命令过你不要轻举妄动吗？
Did I not order you to stand down?

186
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,930
请原谅我 尊敬的陛下
Forgive me, one true Master.

187
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,620
但愿在我击败擎天柱后 您能认可我
But it is my hope that vanquishing Optimus Prime will earn your respect.

188
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,240
擎天柱没那么容易对付
Optimus is not so easily disposed of.

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,760
我已经跟无数愚蠢的自大狂说过这话了！
As I keep trying to explain to all of those who foolishly attempt it.

190
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,410
老千 如果你还不放手的话 我们就都完了
Jackie. If you don't abort, we're both gonna need clean up!

191
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,240
别让我分心 小隔
Trying to focus here, Bulk.

192
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,340
擎天柱哪里去了？
Where's Optimus?

193
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,190
哼 就像我告诉你的 
It's like I told you. 

194
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,620
当我们拖后腿的时候 头头们总是置身事外
When the scrap hits the fan blades -- the generals are the first to bail.

195
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,760
不 擎天柱不是这样的人
No. Not Optimus.

196
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,620
我向您保证 主人\N擎天柱和他的两个同伙会被轰成原子
I assure you, Master. In but a few moments Optimus and two others wili be blown to atoms.

197
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,710
我批准你的行动 骇翼
I will allow it, Dreadwing. 

198
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,990
这也是为了缅怀你的孪生兄弟 但下不为例
In memory of your departed twin. But only this once.

199
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,380
要是骇翼能活着回来 我都会觉得吃惊
I will be quite surprised if we ever set eyes upon Dreadwing again.

200
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,400
擎天柱在哪里？
... Where's the Prime?

201
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:05,340
骇翼？如果你真与天震是孪生兄弟
Dreadwing! If you are anything like Skyquake, I know that you value loyalty and honour.

202
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,340
说这些有意义吗 擎天柱？
Is there a point to your bluster, Prime?

203
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,910
因为威震天丝毫不懂这些
Only that Megatron knows nothing of those principles.

204
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,770
他活着只为了毁灭与征服 
He lives only for destruction and conquest. 

205
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,770
而你有另一个选择 解除炸弹！
But there is another path. Deactivate the bomb.

206
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,400
赶紧离开这里！
Get out of here already!

207
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,820
既然我没把你丢在桑德坎 也不会把你留在这里
I didn't leave you on Sandocan and I'm not leaving you here.

208
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,450
面对现实吧 我们中只有一人能拆除炸弹 而那人就是骇翼
Face it. There's only one bot who can defuse this mess, and his name is Dreadwing.

209
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,010
炮火越来越近了 好像指挥官他…哦！
Blaster fire is getting closer. As if the Commander...

210
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,120
抱歉了 老千 这是因为我爱你！
Sorry, Jackie. It’s ‘cause I love you.

211
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,360
对不起了 鱼儿们
Oh, sorry, fishies!

212
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,860
隔板 等等！
Bulkhead! Wait!

213
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,200
别挡道！
Out of my way!

214
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,950
你给我听着 小隔！
Will you listen to me, Bulk?

215
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,330
你是对的 骇翼是唯一一个能拆除炸弹的家伙
You were right. Dreadwing is the only one who can defuse it.

216
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,430
擎天柱也明白这点
And Optimus knows it too.

217
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,810
骇翼？拆除炸弹 否则你将自食其果
Dreadwing, defuse the bomb. Or fall victim to your own device!

218
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,130
能为我的兄弟报仇 我很荣幸
I will gladly sacrifice myself to avenge my brother.

219
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,680
那反过来 我们也将为兄弟报仇从而一起光荣地回归火种源
Then we will in turn gladly join the Allspark with our brother.

220
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,410
你…是不可能动摇我们的
And with you. You'll never shake us.

221
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,260
好吧…
Very well.

222
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,180
其实我知道要么是蓝色 要么是黄色… 要么是红色
I had it narrowed down to the blue or the yellow. Or the red.

223
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,060
那么 叫谁来收场呢？
So. Who do we call for cleanup?

224
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,490
擎天柱还活着
Optimus Prime still lives.

225
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,400
骇翼 你也活着 
As do you, Dreadwing. 

226
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,890
虽然微不足道 但好歹算是个胜利
And that is a victory, however small.

227
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,900
相比天震的悲剧收场而言
As Skyquake so tragically discovered.

228
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,060
别再提起我的孪生兄弟 威震天陛下
Speak to me not of my twin, Lord Megatron.

229
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,360
我来到地球只为遵从您的意愿 别无二心
For I am here on Earth to obey your will. And yours alone.

230
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,960
指挥官 我只想说很荣幸见识了您的身手
Listen, Commander. I just wanna say... it was an honour watching you work.

231
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,530
我 嗯 我想我以前也许看错您了
I, uh, think maybe I had the wrong idea about you.

232
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,290
很显然比起单打独斗 你在团队中更能一展拳脚
And it would seem that you place a greater value on community than you otherwise let on.

233
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,090
喔 先别操之过急
Whoa, let's not jump the gun here.

234
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,250
得了老千 就算你离开了也会回来的
Come on, Jackie. If you leave, you'll probably just wind up coming right back again.

235
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,210
那只会浪费燃料 现在能量可是很短缺的
All that wasted fuel. And Energon is in short supply.

236
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,800
话说回来 我们这儿房间确实不多
Then again, we do have limited space.

237
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,240
我还不确定是否做好了放弃自由的准备
Not sure if I'm ready to give up my freedom just yet.

238
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,590
让我去探索一番 看看这颗大石头是否适合我
Maybe I could do some exploring, see if this rock suits me.

239
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,490
我并非嫌弃钻击号 不过你需要一个地球的车辆形态
No offense to the "Jackhammer", but you need an earth-based vehicle mode.
