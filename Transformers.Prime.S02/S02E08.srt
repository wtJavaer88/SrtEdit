1
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,390
稍息 士兵
At ease, soldier.

2
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,090
你不会超车啊 蠢货！
Go around, you jerk.

3
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,090
这不是普通的暴走族
That's no road rage.

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,170
有人想撞死我…
Someone's trying to bump me off.

5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,650
…擎天柱？
Prime?

6
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,550
擎天柱！你的铁头生锈了？
Prime, have you flipped your metal wig?

7
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,860
哈哈 很好！
- Haha...\N- Yes!

8
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,910
快点！快点！快点！
Go! Go! Go!

9
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,400
全速前进 神子
Metal to the pedal, Miko.

10
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,450
快开 杰克 快开！
Go, Jack, go!

11
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,630
不可能！拉夫完胜我们了！
No way! Raf's scorching us.

12
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,920
擎天柱？听到了吗？
Prime? Do you read me?

13
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,730
我很抱歉 福特探员
I'm sorry, Agent Fowler.

14
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,720
擎天柱此刻正好不在
Optimus isn't here at the moment.

15
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,580
那么这正好说明
Then I'll take that asa confirmation

16
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,450
想把我撞飞的就是他
that he's presently trying to run me off the road!

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,300
福勒探员 这不太可能
Agent Fowler, that hardly seems likely.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,030
这话你跟我快烧焦的轮胎说吧！
Tell that to my burning treads!

19
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,810
快！快点！
Come on. Come on...

20
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,760
擎天柱！不要！
Prime, no!

21
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,810
看着是挺像擎天柱
Looks like Optimus.

22
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,710
领袖们才不会逃跑
Primes don't run.

23
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,670
你还好吗？
You all right in there?

24
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,330
稍息 士兵
At ease, soldier.

25
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,830
很好 就这样 跟着这道光
Yes, that's it. Follow the light.

26
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,080
啊 等等 什么？
Wait. What?

27
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,160
你这样说吓死我了 救护车
Not the best choice of words, Ratchet.

28
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,210
阿尔茜 你还好吗？
Arcee, are you all right?

29
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,840
当然 除了被擎天柱偷袭了一下
Sure. Except for being blindsided by Optimus.

30
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
我没骗你们吧！？
Didn't I tell you?

31
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,050
难以置信！
Impossible.

32
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,960
我只是在汇报我的所见所闻
I'm only reporting what I saw.

33
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,790
擎天柱为什么要撞死福勒探员？
Why would Optimus try to knock off Agent Fowler?

34
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,360
嗯 或许擎天柱又认为自己是霸天虎了
Maybe Optimus believes he's a Decepticon all over again.

35
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,050
或者他这段时间只是假装好人！
Or he's been faking being a good guy all this time.

36
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,080
不管擎天柱为了何种理由而行为越轨
If Prime has gone off the rails for any reason

37
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,060
我们都有麻烦了
we have a serious problem.

38
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,680
太荒谬了！
This is absurd.

39
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,950
对擎天柱的信号监测表明
A quick check for Optimus' signal will reveal

40
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,370
他今晚压根不在事发现场
that he's nowhere near the location of tonight's incident.

41
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,080
事实上 他正要返回基地
In fact, he's just returning now.

42
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,620
出什么事了吗？
Is something wrong?

43
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,900
我们只是…
We were just...

44
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,490
…想知道你去哪儿了？
wondering where you've been.

45
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,670
我们无法联系上你
We haven't been able to reach you.

46
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,570
我的位置超出了我们的通讯范围
I have been outside of our communication range...

47
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,340
- 哇哦！\N- 别冲动！
- Whoa.\N- Easy.

48
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,830
在一个地下能量矿中
... in a subterranean Energon deposit.

49
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,680
得了吧 他是自己人 不是吗？
Come on. It's our guy. Can't you tell?

50
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,580
我们…很抱歉
We're... sorry.

51
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,040
不要责备他们 擎天柱
Don't blame them, Prime.

52
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,100
今晚早些时候 我被袭击了
I was attacked earlier tonight

53
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,250
某人将我撞出了高速公路
out on the open highway by a big rig--

54
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,470
而它与你惊人地相似
one that bore a striking resemblance to you.

55
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,220
停下！
Halt!

56
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,200
这里是军事禁区
This is a restricted area.

57
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,220
立刻下车 否则我们开火了！
Exit the vehicle, or we will open fire.

58
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,450
我是擎天柱 汽车人的首领
I am Optimus Prime, leader of the autobots.

59
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,990
我来向你们传达一个信息
And I bring you this message.

60
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,060
我是福勒
Fowler.

61
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,670
什么？
What?!

62
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,840
那不可能！
That's not possible.

63
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,210
我以我短裤上的五十个星星打赌
I can tell you sure as there are 50 stars on my star-spangled shorts

64
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,410
那不是他！
it isn't him!

65
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,010
奥列尼军事基地被擎天柱袭击了！
Alden military base is under attack... by Optimus Prime.

66
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,990
那个卡车？
The truck?

67
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,470
机器人！
The 'Bot.

68
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,910
开火！开火！
Fire! Fire!

69
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,530
在那儿！他搬来了援军！继续开火！
There. They brought reinforcements. Resume fire!

70
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,890
汽车人 返回基地
Autobots, return to base.

71
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,510
我们必须避免伤及人类
We must not inflict human casualties.

72
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,920
不 布莱斯将军
No, General Bryce.

73
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,890
擎天柱没有攻击我们的人
Optimus Prime did not attack our boys.

74
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,780
当我收到警报时 擎天柱就站在我身边！
Because I was with Prime when I received the alert.

75
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,140
是的 长官 汽车人去了你的基地
Yes, sir. The Autobots were at your base

76
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,990
但那只是为了应对刚才的袭击
but only in response to the initial attack.

77
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,870
但是 长官 我…是的 长官 我明白了
But, sir, I... Yes, sir. I understand.

78
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,200
这次损失有多大？
So, what's the damage?

79
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,910
所有军队进入一级戒备
All military personnel are under strict orders

80
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,960
对所有的机器人 格杀勿论
to destroy any and all 'Bots on sight.

81
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,230
你开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding?!

82
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,980
他们是无辜的
But th-they're innocent.

83
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,460
擎天柱被陷害了！
Optimus was framed!

84
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,090
这很不幸
Though unfortunate

85
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,200
但是这种命令不能解决问题
the military order changes nothing.

86
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,770
那个冒牌货显然给人类造成了巨大的威胁
Our imposter clearly poses a grave threat to humanity.

87
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,820
一个三十英尺高的变形冒牌货
A 30-foot-tall transforming imposter.

88
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,790
他们真的完成了
They actually did it.

89
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,370
那些屠夫设法破译了代码
Those butchers managed to crack the code.

90
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,280
机械党
M.E.C.H.

91
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,470
长官 有视差或其他潜在问题吗？
Sir, any parallax or latency issues?

92
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,020
不管是汽车还是机器人形态
The telepresence interface performed flawlessly

93
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,590
远程操控界面都非常地完美
in vehicular and robot mode.

94
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,740
机械党劫持了打击
M.E.C.H. abducted Breakdown...

95
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,900
他们把他从头到脚都拆了个遍
and by all indications deconstructed him from cranial chamber to heel strut.

96
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,360
我亲眼所见
I was there.

97
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,360
而且我们最近得知
And we know that, more recently

98
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,670
他们获得了红蜘蛛的变形齿轮
they obtained Starscream's T-cog.

99
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,760
显然 他们将它安在了冒牌货身上
Which they evidently installed in a knockoff of you.

100
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,180
使他能扫描一个合适的车型
Which, in turn, scanned an appropriate vehicle form.

101
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
再填满能量仓
Fill the tank with Energon...

102
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,320
然后黑暗擎天柱就诞生了！
... and say hello to Nemesis Prime.

103
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,030
我们要从哪儿开始？
So, where do we start?

104
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,950
我们根本不知道机械党在哪儿
M.E.C.H.'s base could be anywhere.

105
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,650
别担心
Not necessarily.

106
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,080
尽管机械党了解了我们的生理构造
While M.E.C.H. may have learned much of our biology...

107
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,170
但他们还没有完全掌握我们的技术
They haven't necessarily absorbed our technology.

108
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,420
没有我们的环陆桥
Without access to a Ground Bridge

109
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,040
黑暗擎天柱只能靠车轮子来回奔波
Nemesis Prime would rely solely on its vehicle mode for transportation.

110
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,290
机械党的据点很可能就在两个事故现场的行车范围以内
Chances are the M.E.C.H. base is within driving distance of both incidents.

111
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,770
那我们还等什么？
What are we waiting for?

112
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,900
去把机械党的小小科技项目砸个稀巴烂吧！
Let's get out there and mash M.E.C.H's little science project.

113
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,040
福勒探员 我不建议你再次置身于
Agent Fowler, I do not think it advisable to put yourself

114
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,800
机械党的机器人所带来的危险之中
in harm's way of M.E.C.H's robot again.

115
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,860
好吧 我也不建议汽车人\N再次跑出去当军队的靶子
Well, I'm not sure it's advisable for 'Bots to be running recon with the military out there gunning for you.

116
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,740
我们会保持汽车形态 除非发生紧急情况
We will maintain vehicular cover until absolutely necessary.

117
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,680
除了杂草什么都没有
Nothing but tumbleweeds.

118
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,460
一片空旷
Just a whole lot of empty.

119
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,910
大黄蜂 你要加倍小心
Bumblebee, proceed with utmost caution.

120
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,800
只许侦查 不许交战 我们会在指定地点与你会合
Reconnaissance only. We will rendezvous at your coordinates.

121
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,570
顽固不化的汽车人
The Autobots are persistent.

122
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,410
他们的对手该登场了
Time to meet their match.

123
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,430
大黄蜂
Bumblebee.

124
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,770
保持警惕
Be on your guard.

125
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,300
冒牌货随时可能出现…
My double could be anywhere.

126
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,530
…抱歉 你说什么？
I'm sorry. What?

127
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,400
大黄蜂 收到了吗？
Bumblebee. Do you read?

128
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,980
散开？
Fan out?

129
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,770
小心任何跟我相似的东西
And beware of anything that might resemble me.

130
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,660
如果我能分离出塞拉斯的遥控信号
If I can isolate the control frequency of the remote link Silas is employing

131
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,050
我就能精确定位出他的位置
I should be able to pinpoint his exact position.

132
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,370
遥控？
Remote link?

133
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,020
难道你觉得机械党有高超的技术
You didn't think M.E.C.H. possessed the ability

134
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,920
去制造一个有自我意识的机器人吗？
to build a completely autonomous robot, did you?

135
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,920
我倒希望塞拉斯正躲在内部进行控制
I was hoping Silas would be operating the 'Bot from inside

136
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,230
这样隔板一拳下去就可以 呼呀！
because one punch from Bulkhead, and booyah!

137
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,130
啊哈！信号锁定！
Aha! Frequency isolated.

138
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,580
那就打开环陆桥
Then reopen that bridge.

139
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,310
福勒探员 你没听到擎天柱拒绝你参与进来吗？
Agent Fowler, did you not hear Optimus advise against your involvement?

140
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,950
这关系到你的安全！
It's for your own safety.

141
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,020
听着 医生 我没打算和机器人打架
Look, doc, I don't plan on dancing with any 'Bots

142
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,960
但是那里有人类参与其中
but there's a human element in play here

143
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,520
也许你还不知道
and in case you haven't noticed

144
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,960
我是一名受过特殊训练的 政府级别的 人类
I happen to be a highly trained, government-grade, human.

145
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,200
没错 塞拉斯曾想把他撞飞 这是私人恩怨
Yeah. Plus Silas tried to run him off the road, It's personal.

146
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,860
擎天柱 我们又见面了
Optimus Prime. We meet again.

147
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,440
你的骗局到此为止了 塞拉斯
The deception ends here, Silas.

148
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,630
是这样吗？
Does it?

149
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,250
我连在飞行学校吃的早餐都要吐出来了
I think I'm gonna toss the breakfast I ate back in flight school.

150
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,550
福勒探员 遥控信号的发射源
Agent Fowler, the control frequency is transmitting

151
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,630
在正北100米处的建筑中
from a structure 100 meters due north.

152
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,880
收到了
Copy that.

153
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,030
我的机器人完全复制了你的力量 速度还有火力
My robot chassis possesses all your strength, speed, and firepower.

154
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,100
并且融入了我的格斗技艺
Add my extensive combat training

155
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,990
机械党已经将人类和机器完美地融合在一起
and M.E.C.H. has clearly achieved the perfect meld of man and machine.

156
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,210
知道你我之间的主要差异在哪儿吗？
But the key difference between you and me?

157
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,540
我的身体感觉不到疼痛！
My body can't feel pain!

158
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,360
这只是个开始
This is just the beginning.

159
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,520
想象一下变形机器人组成的军队
Imagine an army of transforming robots.

160
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,990
没有人能对抗涅重生的机械党
No one will stand against the newly rebooted M.E.C.H.

161
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,580
再考虑下吧 小塞同志
Think again, Si.

162
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,460
福勒探员 你到底亲自出马了
Agent Fowler in the flesh at last.

163
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,060
我要拔掉你那游戏机的电源！
And I'm pulling the plug on your video game.

164
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,960
你是军人出身？
Ex-military?

165
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,920
特种战术部队 你呢？
Special tactics. You?

166
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,140
游骑兵团
Army rangers.

167
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,950
很明显 已经退役了
Retired, clearly.

168
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,570
虽然有点儿发福
I may be out of shape

169
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,350
但我不需要打倒你！
but I don't need to bust you up.

170
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,400
我只是为擎天柱争取点时间
I just need to buy Prime a little time.

171
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,780
不 不！
No. No!

172
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,770
不 不 不！
No! No! Nooo!

173
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,590
福勒探员？
Agent Fowler?

174
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,530
那些是我们的人
That would be our boys.

175
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,830
你最好返回基地 擎天柱
I advise you to get back to base, Prime.

176
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,730
我来应付山姆大叔
I'll handle Uncle Sam.

177
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,820
一个很像擎天柱的人把你打趴下了
So, how weird was it to see someone who looked exactly like Optimus

178
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,480
这是多么诡异的一件事啊？
kicking the scrap out of you?

179
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,650
那个情景我永远也不会忘记
It's a sight I won't soon forget.

180
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,830
不知道失去了领导人\N机械党是否还会一如既往地继续行动
The question remains whether M.E.C.H. will continue to function as we know it... without its leader.

181
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,210
还里有一个坏消息
Well, here's the kicker.

182
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,590
我们仔细地检查过了
We sifted through the wreckage with a fine-tooth comb...

183
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,670
没有发现任何塞拉斯的踪迹
And couldn't find any trace of Silas.

184
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,310
他的内部脏器严重受损
The internal damage to his organs is massive

185
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,590
常规的医疗水平已经无能为力
and beyond the scope of conventional medicine.

186
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,140
但我们的领袖是幸运的
Fortunately for our leader

187
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,360
因为机械党能打破常规
M.E.C.H. is anything but conventional.
