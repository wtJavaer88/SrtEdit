1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,020
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,290
天下没有白吃的午餐
Few things of value come without a price.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,640
你想要什么回报？
What is it that you wish in return?

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,300
小人只愿重回霸天虎之列
Only to be a Decepticon once again.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,530
这次您想知道什么呢 我的君王？
Now, what will we be fishing for today, my liege?

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,360
红蜘蛛的真实意图！
Starscream's true motives.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,500
啊 高贵强大的天震
Ah, the high-and-mighty Skyquake.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,640
你应该听我号令！
You shall bow to my command.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,430
融为一体 哈哈哈…我感觉到了！
Symbiosis. Hahaha... I can feel it!

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,280
完了…
Awkward.

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,630
我允许你重回我们的队伍
I will allow you to return to our ranks.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,780
我的个娘啊…感谢火种源！
Oh! Thank the Allspark!

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,380
嘿 别看我没能当成首个踏上塞博特恩的人类
You know, I might not be the first human on Cybertron

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,420
可我还是能成为历史上第一个人类交换生！
but I can still be the first human exchange student.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,040
干嘛不早点告诉我们“终极之钥”的事？
Why didn't you tell us about the Omega keys before?

16
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,770
或许你没注意到
You probably didn't notice

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,150
最近情势有些紧张
but things have been kind of intense around here lately.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,110
这么说…你们真的能在短期内回家了？
So, you guys could really be going home soon, huh?

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,060
别担心 拉夫
Don't worry, Raf.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,160
你随时能来看我们
You'll come visit!

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,440
等咱们安顿好住处之后 他也可以随时来访
Once we get our place set up, he can bunk with us.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,190
对吧 小隔？
Right, Bulk?

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,130
呃…神子
Uh, Miko?

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,070
你会带我去的 对吧？
You are taking me with you, right?

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,670
咱们是不是高兴得早了点儿？
Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves here?

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,930
别说咱们现在无法到达塞博特恩
Not only do we lack any actual method of reaching Cybertron

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,260
就连唯一能复兴星球的工具都在红蜘蛛的手里
but Starscream now controls the sole means of our planet's restoration.

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,510
那是我们仅有的情报…
As far as we know.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,020
您的意思是红蜘蛛可能又回虎窝了？
You think Starscream's rejoined the Cons?

30
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,250
他可能会用“终极之钥”去讨威震天的欢心
He might've used the Omega keys to buy back Megatron's favor.

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,150
哼…他就是个奸商 想看谁出价更高
Hmph. Without first trying to sell them to the highest bidder?

32
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,380
我敢说他不久就会联系我们 并且…
It wouldn't surprise me if he had the nerve to contact us and...

33
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,340
好吧 救大半仙！
Okay, that's weird.

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,500
真是红蜘蛛啊？
Is it Starscream?

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,250
不 是骇翼
No. It is Dreadwing.

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,600
他想和我们见一面
And he wants to meet.

37
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,250
放下武器！
Drop your weapons!

38
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,380
举起手来！
Hands where we can see them!

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,570
我不是来战斗的
I am not here to fight

40
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,090
而是来给你们送这个
but to give you this.

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,630
卓天越之锤？
The Forge of Solus Prime.

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,160
可能装着炸弹
Could be rigged to blow.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,430
骇翼
Dreadwing

44
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,640
你想要什么回报？
what do you ask in return?

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,140
你能善加使用就是最好的报答
Only that you use it wisely.

46
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,110
那么“终极之钥”呢？
And? The Omega keys?

47
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,350
在威震天手里
In Megatron's possession

48
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,930
守卫森严
under heaviest guard.

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,710
小红真的和霸天虎勾结了！
Scream did make a deal with the Cons.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
你用意何在？
Why?

51
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,420
霸天虎之名已被他们玷污了
A shadow of disgrace has been cast upon the Decepticons.

52
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,780
我不愿再与之为伍
It is a cause I no longer wish to be part of.

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,170
那么 我再次请求你
Then I appeal to you again.

54
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,440
加入我们 同心协力 让这场战争彻底终结！
Join us and help end this conflict once and for all.

55
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,570
背叛我的族群…
Betraying my kind

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,550
不代表就要加入你的队伍
is not the same as accepting yours.

57
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,910
这虽然不是星辰剑
It's no Star Saber

58
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,160
但我敢说它肯定能砸碎威震天的剑
but I bet it can shatter Megatron's blade

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,810
顺便砸扁他那张丑脸！
and put some dents into that ugly mug of his.

60
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,460
这锤子不是那么用的
It's not that kind of hammer.

61
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,190
既然四块“终极之钥”都在霸天虎手里
With the Decepticons in possession of all four Omega keys

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,180
那我们不妨用这锤子复制出新的！
a more appropriate use of the Forge would be to use it to replicate our own.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,100
即便锤子有这种力量
Even with such power

64
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,420
我也没有足够的专业知识来进行这种高级复制
their reconstruction would require a level of expertise I do not possess.

65
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,180
那我们只能祈祷威震天不会毁掉所有钥匙
I guess we better hope Megatron doesn't destroy the keys

66
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,110
以防其他人可以回家
to prevent anyone from ever going home.

67
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,430
威震天虽然邪恶无比
Megatron may be evil

68
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,890
但我相信他会让这些钥匙物尽其用的
but I believe he will use the keys for their intended purpose.

69
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,050
那干嘛不让他拿去 也省了咱们的麻烦？
Then I say we let him keep them and do the work for us.

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,860
我是说 由谁来复苏塞博特恩有区别吗？
W... I mean, what difference does it make who restores Cybertron?

71
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,910
如果威震天让塞博特恩重生了
If Megatron revives Cybertron

72
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,220
他必定会借此来扩大自己的政治影响
he will no doubt use it to his political advantage.

73
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,990
这…我…听不懂了
Y-you lost me.

74
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,940
十有八九
In all likelihood

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,120
霸天虎的头目会将自己描绘为救世主
the leader of the Decepticons will portray himself as our planet's savior

76
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,280
将汽车人污蔑为战犯
and brand all Autobots as war criminals.

77
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,810
继续这场巨大的骗局…
The grand deception continues.

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,320
威震天的“功绩”可能会影响塞博特恩几百万年
Megatron's so-called "achievement" could influence Cybertron for eons to come

79
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,200
荼毒返回家园的塞博特恩人的火种和心灵
poisoning the sparks and minds of its returning citizens...

80
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,430
这可不是理想的新时代的开端
hardly the ideal way to begin a new age.

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,380
但我们仍有希望
But there is hope.

82
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,240
威震天虽然已得到了“终极之钥”
For while Megatron may have the keys

83
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,440
他依然没有发现“终极之锁”的存在
he has yet to discover the existence of the Omega lock itself.

84
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,840
“终极之锁？”
Omega lock?

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,220
等等…现在是我听不懂了
Wait... now you lost me.

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,820
那正是“终极之钥”用以激活的东西
That which the four relics were designed to activate.

87
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,380
我们必须抢在威震天前面找到它
We must locate the device before Megatron does

88
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,020
并严加保护 直到我们夺回钥匙
and secure it until we can recover the keys.

89
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,230
可已经没有未破解的铁堡信息了
There are no more Iacon entries to decode.

90
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,220
“终极之锁”可能在地球上的任何地方
This lock could be anywhere on Earth!

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,930
事实上…
Actually...

92
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,520
它在塞博特恩上
It is on Cybertron.

93
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,800
什么？！
What?

94
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,100
你是怎么知道的？
How do you know?

95
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,110
是钛师傅在星辰剑中所传递的信息里说的
Alpha Trion revealed its location to me during the message conveyed by the Star Saber.

96
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,900
你干嘛不早告诉我们？
And you didn't think to tell us.

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,010
是钛师傅嘱咐的
Alpha Trion did not wish it so.

98
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,730
有了“卓天越之锤”
With the Forge of Solus Prime

99
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,310
我们就有了回到塞博特恩的办法
we now possess the means of reaching Cybertron.

100
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,240
我必须加紧工作
I must work quickly

101
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,330
以便尽快利用我们在战略上所取得的优势
as our tactical advantage over Megatron will not last long.

102
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,190
骇翼
Dreadwing.

103
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,680
我一直在找你
I have been searching for you.

104
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,490
随时为您效劳 威震天陛下
I am at your service, Lord Megatron.

105
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,000
我明白红蜘蛛的归来令你有些…难堪
I recognize that Starscream's return to our ranks may be... difficult for you

106
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,030
毕竟你的兄弟是因他而死
given the loss of your twin under his command.

107
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,220
但你的配合是必要的
But your cooperation is essential.

108
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,530
霸天虎只有团结一致 才能复苏和领导塞博特恩
We Decepticons will be best-equipped to rule a restored Cybertron only if we are united.

109
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,190
属下明白
Understood.

110
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,000
假如您乐意的话 主人
And if it pleases you, master

111
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,900
属下愿意以私人身份去和我们的战友沟通
I intend to reach out to our comrade... personally.

112
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,100
该起床了
Rise and shine!

113
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,770
你的变形齿轮移植手术很成功
Your T-cog transplant was a success.

114
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,810
没错 哥就是这么给力！
Yes, I am just that good.

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,780
啊…终于！
Ah... finally.

116
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,550
我都等不及飞起来 在云间穿梭了
I can't wait to take flight and soar above the clouds.

117
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,680
红蜘蛛
Starscream.

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,480
很遗憾地通知你
I regret to inform you

119
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,460
你再也不会有机会展翅高飞了
that you will not live to spread your wings

120
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,720
再也不会！
ever again.

121
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,160
击倒 救我！
Knockout, help me!

122
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,710
骇翼 你到底怎么了？
Dreadwing, what has gotten into you?

123
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,660
哦！慢着！是天震的事儿吗？我还以为这事儿过去了！
Oh. Wait. This is about Skyquake, isn't it? I thought we had put that behind us!

124
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,030
是过去了！
So had I!

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,080
刀剑无眼 沙场伤亡乃兵家常事！
Casualties are an unfortunate consequence of war!

126
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,370
我保证令兄的牺牲是光荣的！
But I assure you, your twin met his end with great honor!

127
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,390
但你玷污了他的荣耀！糟践了他的尸体！
Which you disgraced by raising him from the dead!

128
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,290
呃…被你发现了…
Oh, you know about that.

129
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,840
我一定能为你做些什么！
There must be something I can do

130
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,680
我可以补偿你 减轻你的痛苦！
some form of reparation I can offer to alleviate your anguish!

131
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,620
用你的火种就够了！
Your spark will suffice!

132
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,490
骇翼！
Dreadwing!

133
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,680
退下！
Stand down!

134
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,160
这个玷污我兄长的人必须付出代价！
This desecrator must pay for his actions!

135
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,820
您管这叫忠心吗 主人？！
You call this loyalty, master?!

136
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,020
我让你退下！这是命令！
I said stand down! That is an order.

137
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,580
恕难从命！
One which I cannot follow.

138
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,150
啊…我没死！我没死！
I'm okay? I'm okay!

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,040
威震天陛下 小人将永感大恩大德！
Lord Megatron, you have my eternal thanks.

140
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,850
别让我后悔今天的选择
Do not ever make me regret which one of you I spared.

141
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,530
是我胡思乱想了
Is it my imagination

142
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,170
还是擎天柱最近有点不对头？
or has Optimus been acting differently

143
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,200
自从他接收了钛师傅的信息之后
since that message from Alpha Trion?

144
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,820
嗯…他是隐瞒了咱们一些事
Yeah, he has been keeping things from us.

145
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,800
连救护车他都瞒着
Even Ratchet's out of the loop.

146
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,620
给我一个理由
Well, give me one good reason

147
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,710
为什么擎天柱不能信任我们这些队友？
Optimus couldn't trust his own teammates

148
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,090
隐瞒了“终极之锁”的存在？
why he couldn't have told us about the Omega lock.

149
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,410
因为如果他说了的话
Because if he had

150
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,500
威震天就会从我的脑袋里得到这信息…用那读心设备
Megatron would've pulled it out of my head with his patch.

151
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,900
那有什么关系
Like it matters.

152
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,310
反正虎子们已经得到所有钥匙了…
The Cons are holding all the keys anyway.

153
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,440
时间不等人啊 击倒！
Tick tock, Knockout. Tick tock!

154
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,410
威震天正等待结果呢！
Megatron's expecting results

155
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,340
你也看到他现在心情很差
and given what we just witnessed

156
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,290
我说咱们可决不能让主人失望了！
I would say that we cannot afford to disappoint our master.

157
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,460
“咱们”？
We?

158
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,540
你连根手指都没动
Unless nagging counts

159
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,660
就会在一边絮叨！
I haven't seen you lift a finger!

160
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,270
我已经为他弄回来钥匙了
I am the one who brought him the keys.

161
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,720
我用不着再靠弄清钥匙的用法…
Do I really need to prove myself further

162
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,160
来证明自己的价值了吧？
by deciphering how they operate, too?

163
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,650
哼…要不是某人让我给他做了整形手术
Well, perhaps if my research hadn't been sidelined by someone's cosmetic surgery

164
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,660
我的研究没准儿已经大有进展了!
I might be further along right now!

165
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,590
哼…还是给我看看吧！
Oh, just give it here!

166
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,160
哦 天呐 我怎么没想到这招？
Oh, gee. Why didn't I think of that?

167
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,040
你也这么想的吗…？
Do you think...

168
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,740
准备好了？插！
Ready... go!

169
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,940
哈哈哈 这就是为什么骇翼只配拧螺钉
Hahaha. And that is why Dreadwing is pushing up lug nuts.

170
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,160
…而我们坐办公室
And we are not.

171
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,550
原来如此！
Of course!

172
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,520
如果没有“锁”的话 “钥匙”的存在就毫无意义了
Keys are useless without something to unlock.

173
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,810
将太空桥指向塞博特恩！
Target the space bridge for Cybertron.

174
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,640
又是一个惊人的魔幻般的科学奇迹
Yet another astonishing convergence of magic and science

175
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,930
感谢先祖遗赠
courtesy of the ancients.

176
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,860
还有咱们的头儿
And our leader.

177
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,990
难以置信 仅仅挥舞了几下锤子 砰的一下！
It's hard to believe... a few swings of that hammer, and bam!

178
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,710
环陆桥就变成太空桥了
Our ground bridge is now a space bridge.

179
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,840
探测器检测到地球大气层外有大规模能量爆发
Our sensors are detecting a massive Energon burst occurring outside Earth's atmosphere.

180
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,250
这种爆发只有一种可能…
A surge of that kind could only mean one thing...

181
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,840
另一座太空桥被启动了！
Activation of another space bridge.

182
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,330
威震天已经发现“终极之锁”在塞博特恩了
Megatron has discovered that the Omega lock is on Cybertron.

183
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,200
看起来咱们已经失去了优势
It appears we have lost our advantage.

184
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,210
但威震天并不知道我们也可以星际旅行了
But with Megatron unaware that we now possess the means of interstellar travel

185
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,460
只要出其不意 攻其不备 我们仍有机会
the element of surprise remains in our favor.

186
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,560
为了这次的任务 我们必须祭出所有看家法宝
We must embark on this mission with every resource at our disposal.

187
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,650
红蜘蛛 我不在的期间由你指挥
Starscream. Assume command in my absence.

188
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,990
荣幸之至 主人！
I would be honored, master.

189
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,670
他又在打造什么呢？
What's he forging now?

190
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,130
必须阻止威震天 不惜一切代价！\N（86大电影台词）
Megatron must be stopped, no matter the cost.

191
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,160
根据钥匙显示的标志物
According to the landmarks displayed by the keys

192
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,850
我们寻找的目标就深埋于“锈海”之中
the object we seek is located deep the within the Sea of Rust.

193
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,850
（Sea of Rust 锈海 位于塞博特恩赤道 由不稳定的行星物质和粒子流组成的区域 时常释放出具有腐蚀性 但相对无害的气体）
the object we seek is located deep the within the Sea of Rust.

194
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,310
擎天柱？
Ah! Optimus?

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,100
不 救护车 是我 杰克
Uh, n-no, Ratchet. It's Jack.

196
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,970
有什么事发生了吗？
Is something wrong?

197
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,050
放学都快一个小时了
'Cause school's been out for almost an hour, and

198
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,210
还没人来接我们
no one's showed to pick us up.

199
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,490
那是因为这会儿整个小队都…有事在身
That is because the entire team is rather... indisposed at the moment.

200
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,670
我建议你们今天换种方式回家吧
I suggest you obtain an alternate method of transport.

201
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,700
他说什么？
What's he saying?

202
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,400
嗯…轮子们忙着呢
Eh... The bots are busy.

203
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,800
那就让救护车来接咱们嘛
Then tell Ratchet to come get us!

204
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,680
他可是个大~闲~人~
It's not like he has anything else to do!

205
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,510
总之你们先回家
Just go home!

206
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,910
我稍后再联系你们
I will be in touch later!

207
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,820
喂？喂？
He... hello?

208
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,150
他挂掉了
He hung up.

209
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,490
他又在搞什么飞机？
What crawled up his tailpipe and died?

210
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,500
他有告诉你出什么事了吗？
Did Ratchet tell you what's going on?

211
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,810
没有 他们最近好像一直神秘兮兮的
No. They seem to be keeping us in the dark a lot lately.

212
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,090
怎么？发生什么事了？
Wha... what just happened?

213
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,770
烟幕？
Smokescreen?

214
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,710
这怎么可能！
But that's impossible.

215
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,370
汽车人应该没法到达…
The Autobots do not possess the means to...

216
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,070
干掉他们！
Crush them!

217
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,400
保护好钥匙！
Defend the keys!

218
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,430
我已经击碎过一次你的剑了
I bested your little blade once

219
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,000
大不了再来一次！
and I shall do it again!

220
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,720
如果拿不回钥匙
I will have those keys

221
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,930
我就收了你们的火种！
or I will have your sparks!

222
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,190
后面那件事我可以代劳！
I can help with the last part.

223
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,640
火种剥离器！
The spark extractor!

224
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,240
红蜘蛛！
Starscream!

225
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,370
汽车人已经抢走了“终极之钥”
The Autobots have seized the Omega keys.

226
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,790
立刻派援军过来！
Send reinforcements immediately!

227
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,020
这个嘛 威震天陛下
Actually, lord Megatron

228
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,240
声波和我说了近期的一些情况
Soundwave has been briefing me on recent developments

229
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,620
我们或许已经有了更有效的解决办法
and we may have a more effective solution.

230
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,650
咱们不会领先太久的
Our head start won't last long.

231
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,080
这就是钛师傅说的地点 对吗？
This is where Alpha Trion said we'd find it, right?

232
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,210
坐标是没错
These are the coordinates.

233
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,720
看起来不像啊
Doesn't look like much.

234
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,970
救护车 我们已经找到“终极之锁”了
Ratchet, we have located the Omega lock.

235
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,660
终于…
At last.

236
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,140
根据钛师傅所言
According to Alpha Trion

237
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,140
“终极之锁”就是直接联通火种源的渠道
the Omega lock is a conduit to the very Allspark itself.

238
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,160
擎天柱 如此重大的荣誉
Optimus, an honor like this

239
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,610
不应该属于我
shouldn't belong to me.

240
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,780
汽车人
Autobots

241
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,220
我建议你们停下手头的工作
I would suggest that you put a halt to your task...

242
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,640
把钥匙交给我
and hand over those keys.

243
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,240
凭什么？
And why would we do that?

244
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,480
就凭这些人类都在我手里
So that I may hand over the humans.

245
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,960
如果我们拒绝呢？
And if we refuse?

246
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,240
那我别无选择 只好打开那些舱体
Then I will have no choice but to open the pods

247
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,310
让你们的宠物暴露在塞博特恩剧毒的空气之中
exposing your pets to Cybertron's toxic atmosphere.

248
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,020
然后
And then

249
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,080
我们就可以看着他们一起…痛苦地死去！
we can all watch them instantly perish, together.
