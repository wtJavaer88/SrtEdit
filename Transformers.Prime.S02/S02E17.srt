1
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,820
传说这是不可能发生的
They said it couldn't be done...

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,820
阿尔茜身手敏捷 神出鬼没
the one called "Arcee" is too quick

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,500
根本无法擒获
too stealthy to be captured.

4
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,780
不过 现在你却来到了此地
Well, here you are

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,290
还得到了创造历史的机会
with a rare opportunity to make history.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,670
你知道 我截获了一段汽车人的加密信息
You see, I have intercepted this encrypted Autobot signal

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,250
既然是加密信息
and if it's encrypted

8
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,340
就一定有重要内容
it must be important.

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,900
替我解开密文 我就给你个痛快的死法
Decode it for me, and I will see to it that you perish quickly.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,500
大声点！哭哭啼啼地我听不见你在说些什么
Speak up. I can't hear you when you whimper.

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,890
去死吧
Get... fragged.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,370
或许要让你屈服
Perhaps you will be more inclined to cooperate

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,470
得找另外的人来受罪
when it is not your own well-being at stake.

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,650
阿尔茜 好久不见
Arcee. Been a while.

15
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,630
告诉我加密代码
Give me the encryption code

16
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,940
否则你的同伴飞过山\N就要下去跟汽车人尸骨堆做伴了
or I will add your comrade Cliffjumper to the multitude of fallen Autobots below.

17
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,320
让他死好了 我跟他不熟
Scrap him. I barely know the guy.

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,290
噢 你伤害了我敏感的心
Ouch. Glad I'm not the sensitive type.

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,840
如今的塞博特恩 已经和一个大坟场毫无二致
Cybertron is little more than a graveyard now.

20
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,360
告诉我密码！
Give me the code!

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,300
我不怕你 红蜘蛛
I'm not afraid of you, Starscream.

22
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,650
你不是威震天
You're no Megatron.

23
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,320
才三步 隔板？
Three steps, Bulkhead?

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,010
你就只能走这么远？
That's all you can manage?

25
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,840
对不起神子 我的腿还疼着呢
I'm sorry, Miko. My legs still hurt.

26
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,110
我怎么跟你说的？
What did I tell you?

27
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,930
没有借口
"No excuses."

28
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,990
没错 再来一次
Exactly. Try again.

29
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,670
这次要迈十步
10 steps this time.

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,370
我希望铁堡数据库解码的进展
I hope decoding the Iacon database 

31
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,860
能比隔板康复得更顺利一些
is going more smoothly than Bulkhead's recovery.

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,590
缓慢 但是稳定 我的老朋友
Slow but steady, old friend.

33
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,560
啊 人类科技！
Agh. Human technology.

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,640
不过你在这一领域的专长
But your expertise in the field should provide any edge

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,080
应该能让我们在这场竞赛中领先于霸天虎
 we need to beat the Decepticons at this game.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,520
恐怕他们凭借塞博特恩的科技也不会落后到哪儿去
I fear their access to Cybertronian technology

37
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,520
恐怕他们凭借塞博特恩的科技也不会落后到哪儿去
may provide them with equal advantage.

38
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,030
还不够好！
Not good enough!

39
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,220
你得要比以前更强壮
You have to come back stronger than before!

40
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,370
你得休息一会儿了 隔板
Time for a break, Bulkhead.

41
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,710
休息？
A break?

42
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,190
你觉得在交火中 虎子们会让隔板休息吗？
You think the 'Cons are gonna give Bulkhead a break in the middle of a fire fight?!

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,770
你要是把病人逼得太紧
If you push a patient too far too fast

44
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,390
有可能加重伤情
you risk exacerbating their injuries.

45
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,090
可是…
But...

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,390
隔板该休息了
Bulkhead needs to rest.

47
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,690
让开！
Out of the way!

48
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,650
神子
Miko?

49
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,980
哦呃 嘿 阿尔茜 我只是在…
Oh. Uh... hey, Arcee. I was just...

50
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,210
是不是离悬崖太近了？
Are we a little close to the edge?

51
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,120
我不怕高
Heights don't scare me.

52
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,490
隔板恢复得不错
Bulkhead's coming along just fine.

53
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,770
这大部分都是你的功劳
Thanks mostly to your efforts.

54
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,240
但是他现在需要的是朋友
But he needs a friend right now

55
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,050
而不是操练官
not a drill sergeant.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
不好意思 我上来是想找点私人空间
No offense, but I came up here for some privacy.

57
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,590
我明白你的感受
I understand what you're going through.

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,600
你要是想找人聊聊…
If you ever want someone to talk to...

59
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,940
我很好 行了吧？
I'm fine, okay?

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,340
硬壳差点杀死的不是我
I'm not the one Hardshell tried to scrap.

61
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,770
神子 你在乎的人受了伤 这的确令人难过
Miko, it's rough when someone you care about gets hurt.

62
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
但封闭自己的感情 无济于事
Closing yourself off from feeling... won't help anyone.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,840
好吧 就像你明白似的？
Well, you would know, wouldn't you?

64
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,830
是的
Yes...

65
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,100
我明白
I would.

66
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,690
阿尔茜 很抱歉
Arcee, I'm sorry.

67
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,370
我不是故意提起的
I didn't mean that.

68
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,790
没关系 最近我正好在想他
It's okay. He's... been on my mind lately.

69
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,370
我 失去挡板之后
After I lost my first partner, Tailgate

70
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,320
远离了所有人
I pushed everyone away.

71
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,440
直到飞过山出现了
Until Cliffjumper came along.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,220
他是什么样的人？
What was he like?

73
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,080
小飞他… 很健谈
Cliff was... quite the conversationalist.

74
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,560
飞过山 你怎…
Cliffjumper, are you...?

75
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,630
我… 我没想到你真的关心我
I... I can't... I can't believe you actually care.

76
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,040
我只关心你还能不能讲话 你讲了
The only thing I care about is whether you talked just now.

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,020
你对来救你的人都是这种态度吗？
Are you always this nice to your rescuers?

78
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,940
你没回答我的问题
Didn't answer my question.

79
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,590
我厌倦了红蜘蛛小儿科般的拷问
I got bored with Starscream's little workout.

80
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,070
于是我关闭了引擎 假装昏了过去
So I idled my engines and faked shutdown.

81
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,500
小红信了
Scream bought it.

82
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,800
你怎么被抓来的？
How did you wind up here?

83
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,110
我截获了霸天虎的通讯 听说他们在母星上有所行动
Intercepted some chatter about a Decepticon operation on the old home planet.

84
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,490
我一路跟踪 发现红蜘蛛
So I followed the trail and found Starscream

85
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,410
从这里将大批能量运往塞博特恩
shipping massive amounts of Energon here to Cybertron.

86
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,240
你呢？
What's your story?

87
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,480
一样
Same.

88
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,960
你还真健谈
You're quite the conversationalist.

89
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,350
各种审讯方式我都试过了 都不管用
I've tried every interrogation technique, and nothing is working.

90
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,290
要不是因为他们带着重要的密码 我早就杀了他们
I would just eliminate them, but the code they carry is too valuable.

91
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,230
要是我能直接打开他们拿到密码就好了
If only I could break them open and just take it!

92
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,220
不 我不会把犯人送到地面上的！
No, I will not take the prisoners to the surface!

93
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,740
为什么要让他抢我的功劳？
Why should I let him have all the glory?

94
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,590
他们带着重要的密码
The code they carry is too valuable.

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,700
好吧 反正我也得把能量送给他
All right, since I must deliver the Energon to him anyway...

96
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,830
这里就是卡隆？
So, this is Kaon, huh?

97
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,440
我真喜欢你们经营的这个地方
Love what you Decepticons have done with the place.

98
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,070
这些废墟真是生机勃勃
The ruins are especially picturesque.

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,460
安静！
Silence!

100
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,340
我们到了…
Here we are.

101
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,210
这… 不是个好兆头
That's not a good sign.

102
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,690
既然我没法强迫你们说出加密代码
Since I could not compel you to surrender the encryption code

103
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,610
我只好把你们交给手段更加…
I'm forced to introduce you to someone whose methods are a little more...

104
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,130
有说服力的人
persuasive.

105
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,720
我们可能比我预想的还要惨
We may be in a little more trouble than I thought.

106
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,060
汽车人 来跟震荡波打个招呼吧
Autobots, say hello to Shockwave.

107
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,810
送出高如小山的能量
Delivering a mountain of Energon

108
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,430
截取了汽车人的加密电报
intercepting an encrypted Autobot communicate?

109
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,660
还捕获了两个关键的俘虏 我承认这是很大的功劳
and capturing two key prisoners is impressive, I admit.

110
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,870
不过威震天陛下对他副手的要求比这…
But lord Megatron expects nothing less from his first lieu...

111
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,610
…我是不是该让你开始工作了？
I should let you work, right?

112
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,490
看来你需要专注 继续吧…
No doubt you are trying to concentrate. Carry on.

113
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,730
震荡波 你确信能成功提取加密代码
Um, Shockwave, are you certain you can extract the decryption code

114
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,290
而不是毁掉这个人的神经系统吗？
without first nullifying our subject's neural net?

115
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,620
大脑神经接入器是我发明的
I invented the cortical psychic patch.

116
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,110
我很清楚它的特性
I am familiar with its idiosyncrasies.

117
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,040
这是当然
Of course you are.

118
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,520
别拿着那东西靠近我 你这个独眼怪物！
Keep that thing away from me, you one-eyed freak!

119
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,610
放开她 冲我来！
Leave her alone! Use it on me!

120
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,770
别担心
Do not worry.

121
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,490
要是她的神经承受不了这个过程
If her mind does not survive the procedure

122
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,990
下一个就是你
you will be next.

123
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,250
啊 密码…
Ah. The code.

124
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,820
阿尔茜 阿尔茜！我要杀了你们两个！
Arcee. Arcee! I'll scrap you both!

125
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,700
闭嘴！我在听！
Shut up! I'm trying to listen!

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,830
我是擎天柱
This is Optimus Prime.

127
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,360
至所有收到这条信息的汽车人
To all surviving Autobots who hear this message

128
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,880
我邀请你们到银河系一个偏远的角落来与我会合
I ask you to join me in a remote corner of the galaxy.

129
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,280
这是一个充满能量的小星球
on a small planet rich with Energon.

130
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,150
我有理由推断
I have reason to believe this\Nworld will soon

131
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,350
这里很快就会成为霸天虎新的侵略目标
become a new target of Decepticon conquest.

132
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,140
我的队伍小而精悍
Our team is small but strong.

133
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,430
到这些坐标来与我会合 以便策划抵抗运动
Join me at these coordinates so that we might plan our resistance.

134
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,070
一路平安
Safe journeys.

135
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,640
啊 干得漂亮！
Aha! Brilliant!

136
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,320
现在我们不但知道擎天柱的位置
Not only do we know where to find Optimus Prime

137
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,480
还知道他在求援
but he's begging for help.

138
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,590
这正是突击的好时机！
Now is the time to strike!

139
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,440
你没有利用价值了…
You are no longer of use.

140
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,070
嘿 小红 我很好奇
Hey, Scream. Curious...

141
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,380
你总是让别的虎子帮你下手吗？
you always let other Cons do your dirty work?

142
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,480
震荡波！你已经杀掉了一个我的俘虏
Shockwave! You already disposed of one of my prisoners.

143
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,400
飞过山是我的
Cliffjumper is mine.

144
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,720
你的想法很不合逻辑
Your reasoning is hardly... logical.

145
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,410
不过请自便
But indulge yourself.

146
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,390
你觉得怎样 飞过山？
What do you think, Cliffjumper?

147
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,320
这里的选择多种多样
Plenty to choose from here.

148
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,240
我们是要精确的对半开呢？
Shall we go with precise dissection

149
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,360
还是钝器呢？
or blunt force?

150
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,350
随你选 小红 不管你选什么
Your choice, Scream. Whatever you pick

151
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,170
最终都是我用在你身上
I'm just gonna end up using it on you.

152
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,650
好吧
Very well.

153
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,230
要不我们来用最传统的方法
Why don't we do this the old-fashioned way?

154
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,930
不 不！
No! No!!

155
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,700
多谢相救
Thanks for the save.

156
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,440
该你说了 红蜘蛛
Your turn, Starscream.

157
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,880
能量是用来做什么的？
What's with all the Energon?

158
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,500
我怎么会告诉你
As if I would tell you!

159
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,610
你不说 就用你做实验 我没有开玩笑！
Talk, or you're a science experiment. I'm not kidding!

160
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,450
你最好告诉她点东西
You should probably tell her something.

161
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,920
我不确定我能拖住她多久
I'm not sure how long I can hold her back.

162
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,640
这方面我不是专家
I'm no expert with this thing

163
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,010
不过我知道 只要手一滑 就能烧毁整个神经系统
but I hear one slip-up can fry a neural net.

164
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,980
震荡波！你们该找的是他！
Shockwave! He's the one you want!

165
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,190
他正在卡隆地下建造一个太空桥！
He's building a Space Bridge beneath Kaon.

166
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,080
不可能
Impossible.

167
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,880
太空桥技术已经失传好几个兆周了！
Space bridge technology's been lost for mega-cycles.

168
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,420
但是他做到了！
And yet he managed!

169
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,490
震荡波从不离开塞博特恩 正是因为他能回收到零件
Shockwave never left Cybertron precisely so he could scavenge parts

170
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,080
并且通过反向工程研究出太空桥的原理！
and reverse-engineer space bridge mechanics!

171
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,630
你送来的能量刚好够他启动太空桥的！
And you just delivered all the Energon he needs to power it up.

172
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,260
是的 虽然这么做令我煎熬\N不过我还是尝试着合作 呃！
While it often pains me, I try to be a team player.

173
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,420
你去哪儿？
Going somewhere?

174
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,170
去摧毁太空桥
To take down a space bridge.

175
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,400
不带上我吗？
Without me?

176
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,160
这个行动需要隐蔽
This'll require stealth/

177
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,830
而不是…闲扯
Not... chatter.

178
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,230
你说的闲扯分散了红蜘蛛的注意力 好让你有时间挣脱
Oh, you mean the chatter that distracted Starscream long enough for you to free yourself?

179
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,720
别拖我后腿就成！
Just try not to slow me down.

180
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,100
你知道怎么走吗？
You know where you're going?

181
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,470
我所在的部队曾经利用这些坑道活动
My unit used these tunnels during the war.

182
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,490
这是旧塞博特恩的一部分
They're part of old Cybertron.

183
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,090
我们早点毁掉太空桥
The sooner we blow the bridge

184
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,300
就能早点与擎天柱会合
the sooner we join up with Optimus Prime.

185
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,520
代我向他问好
Give him my regards.

186
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,140
你没听到擎天柱的信息吗？
Did you not hear Prime's message?

187
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,140
他需要我们！
He needs us.

188
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,760
我不擅长团队合作
Teamwork isn't my thing.

189
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,570
我们了结这件事之后
after we finish this

190
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,590
你我各奔东西
you and I go our separate ways.

191
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,900
你说了算 搭档
Whatever you say, partner.

192
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,670
把话说清楚
Let's get one thing straight...

193
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,640
你不是我的搭档！
you are not my partner.

194
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,520
阿尔茜 我明白这不好受 真的
Arcee, I know it's rough. I really do.

195
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,850
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

196
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,870
挡板
Tailgate.

197
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,570
挡板！
Tailgate!

198
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,290
封闭自己的感情
Closing yourself off from feeling...

199
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,240
- 无济于事\N- 无济于事
- won't help anyone.\N- won't help anyone.

200
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,510
听着耳熟
Sounds familiar.

201
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,320
那是个好建议
Good advice is good advice.

202
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,410
我想知道 接下来怎样了？
So, I got to know... what happened next?

203
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,390
震荡波的最新杰作
Shockwave's latest work of art.

204
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,140
我已经感觉它要吸进去东西了
Already fueled and ready to rip.

205
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,580
阿尔茜 看那个眼熟吗？
Arcee... look familiar?

206
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,190
擎天柱提供的坐标
The coordines Optimus provided.

207
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,280
太空桥的目的地已经指向了那里
They're being used to target the space bridge.

208
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,430
这意味着虎子们将会偷袭擎天柱的队伍
Which means the 'Cons will ambush Optimus

209
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,700
赶在汽车人的援军到达之前
and his team. before any Autobot reinforcements can get there.

210
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,940
要是虎子们杀害了擎天柱
If the 'Cons scorch Optimus

211
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,640
战争必败无疑
the war is as good as over.

212
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,970
我们能挽救这一切
We can fix that.

213
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,270
不行 我们的能力不足以摧毁太空桥
No. We don't have the ordnance to blow the bridge.

214
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,730
我得想办法破坏控制系统
I'll have to sabotage the control systems.

215
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,000
怎么做？
What about access?

216
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,430
你打算走上去向他们寻求许可吗？
You just gonna walk up and ask for permission?

217
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,800
不 是你去
No... you are.

218
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,840
啊 不好意思
Uh, excuse me.

219
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,970
我从观光团掉队了
I got separated from the tour group.

220
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,280
你们知道怎么去霸天虎基地吗？
Does anyone know where I can find the Decepticon base?

221
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,820
喔 红蜘蛛指挥官没有跟你们说过吗？
Whoa! Didn't Commander Starscream tell you?

222
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,580
我现在是你们一边的了
I'm on your side now.

223
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,020
那个胆小鬼擎天柱夹着尾巴溜了
That coward Optimus Prime turned tail and ran.

224
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,050
留下我们这些汽车人自求多福
Left the rest of us Autobots to fend for ourselves.

225
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,290
毫无同伴情谊 哼
So much for comraderie, huh?

226
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,760
我想我还是加入胜利者的队伍好了
Figured I'd rather be on the winning team.

227
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,820
于是接受了红蜘蛛的招安
So I took Starscream up on his offer.

228
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,180
猜猜看擎天柱看到\N满天霸天虎降落时是什么表情！
Imagine the look on Prime's face when it starts raining Decepticons...

229
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,440
我也在其中！
me with them.

230
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,920
看 我知道红蜘蛛的所有计划
Really, I know all about Starscream's plan.

231
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,820
我们会相处得很好的
We can all get along now.

232
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,830
有人在我身后 是吧？
There's... someone behind me, isn't there?

233
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,870
只有红蜘蛛才会在处决手无寸铁的囚犯时失手！
Only Starscream could fail to dispose of a helpless captive.

234
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,440
嗯 那是正常工作的声音吗？
Uh... is it supposed to sound like that?

235
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
闯入者！
Interloper!

236
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,300
你改写了能量容载的程序 对吧？
You have overridden the Energon-containment protocols, haven't you?

237
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,220
很聪明 不过我能修好！
Clever, but not irreversible.

238
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,470
要摧毁一个神经系统有很多方法
There is more than one way to nullify a neural net.

239
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,210
这次你别想！
Not this time.

240
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,280
小飞？
Cliff?

241
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,120
我就知道你关心我！
I knew you cared.

242
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,980
看来震荡波的自大出卖了他
It appears Shockwave's arrogance was his undoing.

243
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,950
摧毁他们！
Destroy them!

244
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,960
汽车人 不管你们对太空桥做了什么
Autobots... whatever you did to the space bridge

245
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,390
快撤消！
undo it now!

246
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,220
他们要是真想向我们寻求帮助 就应该停火
They should really stop shooting at us if they want our help.

247
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,730
眼下我们的退路已经被阻断了
Seeing as how our exit is blocked

248
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,720
而正好有个太空桥的传送门指向擎天柱的位置
and we have an open space bridge portal currently set for Prime's location...

249
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,350
你跟我来吗？
You with me?

250
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,860
太空桥 快爆炸了！
The space bridge... it's going to blow!

251
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,380
有什么能耐都使出来吧！
Give it everything you got!

252
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,110
正中红心！
Bull's-Eye!

253
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,350
你觉得震荡波还活着吗？
Think Shockwave survived?

254
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,500
最好还活着 我要再和他较量一番！
Hope so. I want a rematch.

255
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,780
我们去找擎天柱吧 搭档
Let's find Optimus... partner.

256
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,200
充满能量 嗯？
Rich with Energon, huh?

257
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,560
但愿整块石头不全是这番光景
Hope the whole rock doesn't look like this.

258
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,660
这让我想起当年我在锈海迷失的时候
Reminds me of the time I was lost in the Sea of Rust

259
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,660
（Sea of rust 锈海 由星球上不稳定化学物质\N所构成的海洋 位于塞博特恩赤道)
Reminds me of the time I was lost in the Sea of Rust

260
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,260
在塞博特恩
back on Cybertron

261
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,330
不过那次我脱离了部队 连一个说话的人都没有！
except I was separated from my unit with absolutely no one to talk to.

262
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,710
（Sea of rust 锈海 由星球上不稳定化学物质\N所构成的海洋 位于塞博特恩赤道)
Talk at?

263
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,710
是喋喋不休吧？
Talk at?

264
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,930
承认吧 你喜欢有人陪着！
Admit it... you love the company!

265
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,010
有趣
Funny...

266
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,270
一开始我觉得我不可能习惯飞过山的喋喋不休
At first, I didn't think I'd ever get used to Cliff's constant chatter.

267
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,510
可现在 却总是感觉过于安静了
Now... there's nothing louder to me than the silence.
