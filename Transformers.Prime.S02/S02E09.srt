1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,920
福勒探员 请进
Special agent Fowler, please come in.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,780
为什么列兵戴利会在那里摄像？
What's private Daley doing here with that camera?

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,570
他将为今天的会话做记录
He will be making a record of today's session.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,720
士兵 太近了
Soldier... too close.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
很抱歉我的穿着不合场合
Sorry I didn't dress for the occasion.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,680
与平时一样就好 比尔
Formality won't be any more necessary than usual, Bill.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,330
但我不得不通知你\N我们的上司已经做好了战争准备
But I do need to inform you that our higher-ups are on the war path.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,500
他们得明白最近事件发生的原委
They want answers regarding recent events.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,200
或许我们应该从擎天柱的死亡开始
Perhaps we should begin with the demise of Optimus Prime.

10
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,660
我以为我们已经讨论过了！
I thought we've straightened all this out.

11
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,590
擎天柱现在活得很好
Prime is alive and well.

12
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,540
这对高层来说很难接受
That's difficult for our superiors to accept

13
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,780
除非能看到擎天柱和他的仿冒品
without the benefit of seeing Optimus and the alleged imposter.

14
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,490
看到他们两个站在一起？目前看来是不行了
Side by side? That didn't seem to be the wisest option at the time.

15
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:38,260
空军接到直接命令 一旦发现任何汽车人 立即摧毁
The sky jockeys were under direct orders to destroy any and all Autobots on sight.

16
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,710
我们现在在高度戒备状态
We were in a heightened state of security.

17
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,390
来说说好消息
Let's consider the positives.

18
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,850
现在我们掌握了关于机械党的更多情报
We now possess greater intel regarding M.E.C.H..

19
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,060
尤其是他们的匪首 塞拉斯
Particularly their leader, Silas.

20
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,860
真名是莱兰・毕晓普 上校 前特种战术部队成员
the stage name of one Colonel Leland Bishop, ex-special tactics.

21
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,690
主导设计了达摩克利斯计划
The architect of project Damocles.

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,320
通过卫星激光束 攻击地球上的任意目标
Satellites in orbit firing laser beams at any target on Earth.

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,140
很早以前就废止了
Long since mothballed

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,940
这也是毕晓普叛逃的主要原因
and the primary reason for Bishop's discharge.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,200
叛逃之后 他更肆无忌惮地\N重拾曾经放弃的其他疯狂计划
He had other wild ideas, which he practiced with even greater abandon once he went rogue.

26
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,930
现在仍没有找到他的尸体
And still, no sign of his remains.

27
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,410
更令人担心的是
Of greater concern

28
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,350
塞拉斯的手下可能也是特战成员
M.E.C.H. agents, like Silas, might also be special tactics.

29
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,530
难道是现役人员？
As in, currently enlisted?

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,920
所以他们要把脸蒙上
One obvious motive for hiding their faces.

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,460
我想申请继续深入调查
I would urge a thorough investigation

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,330
而我们的金属大手朋友在这方面要远远胜于我们
and leave bigger threats to metal hands more capable than our own.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,750
因为你被批准进行如此高度机密的任务
Because you've been allowed to operate at these deeply classified levels

34
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,110
所以或许我们需要你提供背景资料
perhaps you could provide some background.

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,970
我们的变形朋友是有着自主意识的机械生命体
Our transforming visitors are autonomous, robotic organisms

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,090
来自塞博特恩星球 他们曾经历了一场战争
from the planet Cybertron. They were fighting a war.

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,740
核心问题 是为了我们的世界对于能量的控制权
Foremost, over control of our world's supply of Energon

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,120
也就是汽车人以及霸天虎的生命能量
the fuel and lifeblood of all Autobots and Decepticons alike.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,900
你还记得战争的末期吗？
Do you recall the period late in the war

40
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,510
双方都把找到的能量藏在外星球
when both sides began hiding their Energon spoils off-world?

41
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,490
当然记得 所以在这样的星球上会有能量矿
Of course, it's the reason Energon deposits exist on planets such as this one.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,350
正是如此 这样的星球上才会有战争
It is also the reason battles came to be waged on planets such as this one.

43
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,530
这场争夺能量和黑暗能量的战争 延续至今
These battles over Energon, and its dark counterpart, continue to this day.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,220
你对这些确信吗？
And you know this for certain?

45
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,340
我的所见不但使我信服
I've seen more than enough to make me a believer.

46
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,710
我还通过擎天柱的队伍获取战场情报
But I rely upon field reports from team Prime

47
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,010
然后再共享给你
which I, in turn, share with you.

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,780
能跳过这些吗？
Skip ahead, if you would

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,180
直接叙述你所参与的部分 福勒探员
to the history of your involvement, Agent Fowler.

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,840
你也知道 我刚开始并不喜欢这项看管汽车人的工作
As you know, I wasn't overjoyed with what I assumed was gonna be a bot-sitting assignment.

51
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,960
擎天柱！
Prime!

52
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,630
等等 别告诉我你们在办托儿所吗？
Wait. Don't tell me. He's out pancaking a mini-mall.

53
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,530
然而我发现这项工作的危险系数过于惊人
But its occupational hazards turned out to be surprisingly severe.

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,320
把能量棍拿来…
Bring the prod.

55
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,180
另外汽车人也无数次挽救了我的生命
And, by now, the bots have saved my bacon more times than I can count.

56
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,320
当然 我也投桃报李 还了一些人情
Of course, I've returned the favor a time or two...

57
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,360
随叫随到 伙计 着地支援这就来
Any time, fella. Ground floor's coming fast.

58
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,210
有时需要利用下职权
... sometimes exercising my authority...

59
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,400
这女孩我带走
The girl comes with me.

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,870
有时需要依靠敏捷的思维
... sometimes relying upon quick thinking.

61
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,650
我们就是…校准了一下系统 我们还…
We were just... calibrating the subsystems, and we, uh

62
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,010
有点小问题 但现在好了
had a... surge.  But it's fine now.

63
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,850
你那边好吗？
How are you?

64
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,180
我也犯过一些错
And I've made a few mistakes.

65
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,700
啊！又来这套！
Ah! Not again!

66
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,910
啊 又是这套把戏！
Ah! Not this again!

67
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,650
福勒探员 能逐一介绍一下他们吗？
If you would, Agent Fowler, provide a roll call.

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,030
要是碰巧遇上 我们好分清张三李四？
So, we'll know who's who in the event of another bot snaps?

69
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,370
没错
Something like that.

70
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,430
好吧那么…
Well, there's...

71
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,260
隔板
Bulkhead.

72
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,070
你是一辆车？
Are you a car?

73
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,010
我敢说你是卡车 是大脚车！
I bet you're a truck ... a monster truck!

74
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,920
你喜欢重金属音乐吗？你多重？
Do you like heavy metal? How much do you weigh?

75
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,390
用破碎锤打过沙包吗？
Ever use a wrecking ball for a punching bag?

76
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,830
听着 神子 我在成为战士之前 是个工人
Look, Miko, before I became a warrior, I was a laborer

77
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,980
建筑工 我能造东西 也能拆东西
-- nstruction. I can build stuff. I can break stuff.

78
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,300
可别的都不会
And that's it.

79
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,370
当然我跟这个大块头并不很投缘
Of course, big foot and I don't always see eye to eye.

80
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,170
别用那个电话 它…
Don't use that phone. It's...

81
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,400
坏了
out of order.

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,360
他不是最敏捷的汽车人
He may not be the most agile bot...

83
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,180
别往下看
Don't look down.

84
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,650
他也是最不可能成为科学家的一个
And he's the first to admit he's no rocket scientist.

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,320
拜托 医生 没什么好检查的
Come on, Doc. There's nothing up there to scan.

86
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,640
把频道调回去 我想看完这整场节目
Switch it back! I want to see the hoedown showdown!

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,950
但他的蛮力是无价之宝
But his brute strength is invaluable.

88
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,790
所幸救护车是技术领域的专家
Thankfully, the science angle is more than covered by Ratchet.

89
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,120
医官他比较…严谨
The Doc can be a little... tightly wound.

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,140
你们也想做到最好吧？
Without my supervision?!

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,950
那就欣赏大师的手笔吧！
You want them to be right, don't you?

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,760
控制狂
Control freak.

93
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,260
但当需要他战斗时也毫不含糊
But he brings his "A" game when the situation calls for it.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,530
没事了
It's all right.

95
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,310
我是一辆救护车
I'm an emergency vehicle.

96
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,720
还有阿尔茜
Then there's Arcee.

97
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,290
那辆摩托车？
The motorcycle?

98
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,050
不要被那小巧的身材所迷惑
Don't be fooled by the smaller footprint.

99
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
她很厉害
She leaves a mark.

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,380
大黄蜂是队伍中的侦察兵
Bumblebee's the team scout.

101
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,920
但要我说 这个还在培训中的战士比看上去要成熟
But the warrior-in-training seems pretty accomplished, if you ask me.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,850
阿尔茜可以说是少言寡语了
Arcee may be a bot of few words

103
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,570
而大黄蜂更是完全不能说话…
but Bumblebee doesn't use any...

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,060
…说了我们也听不懂
... that we can understand.

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,740
它…想让我们上车
I-It wants us to get in.

106
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,020
不 就我一个
No, just me.

107
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,330
你怎知道的？
How do you know that?

108
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,580
它就是这么说的
It said so.

109
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,790
这跟他的一段经历有关
Turns out it's with good reason.

110
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,710
在塞博特恩的战争中
During the war for Cybertron

111
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,720
这个可怜的孩子被威震天损毁了发声器
the poor kid got his voice box torn out by Megatron.

112
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,230
所以汽车人并非如我们所想的那般坚不可摧
So, the Autobots aren't quite the indestructible war machines we'd hoped.

113
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,930
不要误会 他们具有很强的抗击打能力
Don't misunderstand. They can take serious punishment.

114
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,550
但他们确实有弱点
But they do have their... vulnerabilities.

115
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,860
你刚刚像小女孩一样尖叫了吗？
Did you just scream like a little girl?

116
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,660
没有 或许吧
No! Maybe...

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,860
这或许不是我们意料中的结局
This may not be the finish that we had planned

118
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,860
但如果真要在这里结束
but if this is indeed the end

119
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,450
如果我们要和火种源融为一体…
if we are to become one with the Allspark...

120
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,220
不！飞过山的生命信号…
No. Cliffjumper's life signal

121
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,000
刚刚消失了
just went offline.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,210
站在这儿哭是不会让他复生的
If Cliff's gone, standing around here sulking won't bring him back.

123
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,490
我们曾经在失去飞过山时悲痛地认识到了这一点
We learned that the hard way when we lost Cliffjumper.

124
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,840
根据你的报告 飞过山是上一个阵亡的汽车人？
And, for the record, Cliffjumper was the last Autobot casualty?

125
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,000
我告诉过你 你缴获的那个无生命的汽车人不是擎天柱
I told you. The lifeless Autobot you have in storage isn't Prime.

126
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,550
那是个冒牌货
It's a Knockoff!

127
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,200
我们只是听了你的一面之词
We have only your word to go on

128
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,930
并没有发现塞拉斯的踪迹
without any trace of Silas

129
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,960
也没有证据表明他掌握了复制和遥控技术
or the alleged technology M.E.C.H. utilized to control said Knockoff.

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,280
清除一切痕迹是机械党的处事方法
A clean scrub is M.E.C.H.'s M.O.

131
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,630
你和我都了解这点！
You and I both know it!

132
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,600
你最后的报告中称擎天柱加入了霸天虎！
Your last debriefing indicated that Optimus Prime had joined the Decepticons.

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,410
那不是他自愿的！擎天柱失忆了
Not willfully! Prime had amnesia.

134
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,130
我以为我已经说得很清楚了！
I know I was clear on that.

135
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,160
但你要明白我们的外部观察员\N可以把这个与最近军事基地的遇袭联系起来
But you can see where outside observers might connect the dots to the recent attack on our base.

136
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,460
比尔 五星上将们很担心
Bill, the five-stars have grown

137
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,720
我们信任的这些生命体 一旦反目
nervous that we've been placing our trust in beings who could so easily inflict harm

138
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,780
能轻而易举地伤害我们
if they chose to turn on us.

139
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,870
因此我接到命令来审查你
That's why I've been asked to determine

140
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,790
决定是否交付军事法庭
whether I should bring you before a tribunal.

141
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,140
军事法庭？他们会停止整个行动！
Tribunal? They could shut down our operation

142
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,490
把我关进监狱！
put me in jail.

143
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,240
布莱斯将军 擎天柱不是莽撞的人！
General Bryce, Prime is no loose cannon.

144
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,490
他绝对不是！
He's anything but.

145
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,500
汽车人虽然很巨大 但他们行动很谨慎
The bots may be big, but they watch where they step.

146
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,820
哪怕是孩子们…
Heck, even the kids...

147
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,980
孩子们？
Kids?

148
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,420
啊 哈哈 我们是这样称呼我们的…
Ah... that's what we call our...

149
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,000
…室内预备队的
"in-house support team".

150
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,890
我不知道除了你以外
I wasn't aware you were utilizing any of our resources other than yourself.

151
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,090
他们不是…现役军人
They're... not enlisted.

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,010
你让平民涉入军事机密行动？
You've involved civilians in a classified operation?

153
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,430
他们是优秀的人才 在…
Highly accomplished civilians who contribute specialized expertise in...

154
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:43,080
计算机 医学 以及…沟通交流方面有杰出的贡献
computer science... medicine... uh... communications.

155
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,300
我喜欢拆东西！
I love breaking stuff!

156
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,450
变态！
Twisted.

157
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,150
把心脏带回来
Bring the hurt!

158
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,050
书呆子又来了
Nerd alert.

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
僵尸！
Zombie!

160
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,020
是从外太空降临的 太厉害了…
Smackdown in outer space. That was cool.

161
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,610
那么他们会服从命令吧
So, they know how to take orders.

162
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,510
可以…这么说吧
You... could... say that.

163
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,030
欢迎光临KO快餐厅 每个肉饼都顶呱呱
Welcome to K.O. Drive-In, where every patty's a Knockout.

164
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,350
您想要点什么？
May I take your order?

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,510
但是他们打破常规思维去解决问题的方式
But while they lack in military discipline

166
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,840
完全足以弥补缺乏军事训练的不足
they more than make up for with outside-the-box problem-solving.

167
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,210
唉 没声音
Nothing.

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,930
天哪 谁想得到
Gee, imagine that.

169
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,080
四维空间的手机信号这么差
The fourth dimension has lousy cellphone reception.

170
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,980
嘿 伙计们…电话响了
Wait, guys, guys, guys. The phone... rang.

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,360
说明有信号
We're getting a signal.

172
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,950
汽车人看不见也听不见我们 可能是因为…
Maybe the Autobots can't see or hear us because...

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,710
我们也许在做超高速运动
we're moving at hyperspeed or something.

174
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,350
他们勇气可嘉
Their courage is to be admired.

175
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,570
把他按住！
Hold him still!

176
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,130
他们一次又一次的证明了
They've proven, time and again

177
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,310
他们为了自己的国家
that they're willing to put their lives on the line for their country...

178
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,510
自己的星球甘愿牺牲
and their planet.

179
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,310
因此你的平民队员与敌人有过接触
So, your civilians have made enemy contact.

180
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,930
我对面孔过目不忘 人类的也算上
I never forget a face... even that of a human.

181
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,750
你要是敢骗人
You double-cross anyone

182
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,440
我让你永远忘不了我这张脸 给我记住！
mine is the face you'll never forget! Never!

183
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,880
基本上 他们什么都见识过了…
They've... pretty much seen it all.

184
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,500
神子 别看！
Miko, look away!

185
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,700
- 但…\N- 把头扭过去！
- But...\N- Turn your head away!

186
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,700
但是请放心 汽车人重视这些人类――
Rest assured, the safety of these humans... of all humans...

187
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,320
甚至是所有人类――的生命安全
remains the primary concern of the Autobots.

188
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,750
他们没有防护罩！
They have no protective shell.

189
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,820
如果不小心被踩到 他们就…扁了
If they get underfoot, they will go... squish.

190
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,600
那么从现在起 救护车
Then, for the time being, Ratchet

191
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,420
我们必须走一步 看一步
we must watch where we step.

192
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,330
并且我们的同伴也不会改变这个立场
And our colleagues wouldn't have it any other way.

193
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,050
这儿对我来说就像天堂一样
I'm living a dream here in bots' "wanna".

194
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,050
你们谁都别想破坏我的美梦！
And I will not allow you or anyone else to shatter it!

195
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,290
他们同汽车人建立了深厚的羁绊
They've forged meaningful bonds with the bots.

196
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,480
阿尔茜呢？
Where's Arcee?

197
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,140
你干脆跟她结婚好了
Why don't you just marry her?!

198
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,820
我就在你后面
I'm right behind you.

199
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,580
在我忙于做其他事时
And they provide valuable assistance whenever

200
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,750
他们为汽车人提供了可贵的帮助
I'm otherwise engaged in the field.

201
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,770
这是威廉・福勒特工的电话号码
You've reached special Agent William Fowler.

202
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,650
我正在进行秘密强化训练
I'm currently on an intensive training retreat

203
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,220
周二之前不会回来
and unavailable until Tuesday.

204
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,790
我讨厌跟机器说话
I hate talking to machines.

205
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,940
他们参与的所有行动
But their involvement was never intended to be

206
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,200
都是经过人道主义考量的
anything other than humanitarian...

207
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,700
通过他们 汽车人对地球上的生命加深了了解
to provide the Autobots with the means of better understanding life on our planet.

208
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,870
侦察兵应该能杀人于无形
A scout should be silent but deadly.

209
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,970
怎么？
What?

210
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,630
可能还要装一个小东西
Maybe it needs one of these doohickeys.

211
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,660
你是摩托车 阿尔茜
You're a motorcycle, Arcee.

212
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,800
你难道不会制造摩托发动机吗？
Shouldn't you know how to build a motorcycle engine?

213
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,940
你还是人类呢 杰克 你能造出小肠来吗？
You're a human, Jack. Can you build me a small intestine?

214
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,670
你们要传送的地方 不光是密闭空间
You want me to not only bridge you into a confined space

215
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,210
而且移动速度每小时140多公里！
but one traveling at 90 miles per hour?!

216
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,020
我根本无法想象可能出现的意外
I can't even count the number of ways that can go wrong...

217
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,820
大面积错位损伤 四肢骨折 金属烧伤
mass displacement, trauma, twisted limbs, metal burn.

218
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,760
呃 也许没有最后那种
Well, maybe not the last one.

219
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,570
不过 他们的很多科学技术我们都还没学到
Sadly, we haven't begun to take full advantage of their science.

220
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,590
比如 我可以不穿航空服驾驶垂直起降战机
I mean, I can pilot my v-tol without ever having to wear a flight suit.

221
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,310
你的内脏不会爆炸吗？
What keeps your organs from exploding?

222
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,930
救护车对机舱内的调压器做了改进
A modification Ratchet performed on the cabin-pressure regulator.

223
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,570
我…喜欢舒服一些
I like to be comfortable.

224
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,160
…有些跑题了
We... may be getting off track.

225
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,530
请你说明为什么威震天的项上人头还未被献上？
Please address why we haven't yet been served Megatron's steel head on a silver platter.

226
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
不…
No!

227
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,650
霸天虎头目的生命力极其顽强…答案简单明了
The leader of the Decepticons has nine lives, plain and simple.

228
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,400
可我看见的确实是他
Well, I'm staring right at him.

229
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,620
好消息是 威震天没有回应我的目光
Good news is, Megatron isn't exactly staring back.

230
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,560
我们并非没有尝试过
It's not like we haven't tried.

231
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,780
糟糕的是
The sick part is

232
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,690
当我们能干掉他的时候 我们需要他
the moment we might have pulled it off, we needed him.

233
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,510
威震天事实上帮助过我们拯救了全人类
Megatron actually helped us save humanity.

234
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,870
擎天柱 我们过去的阵营 什么汽车人 霸天虎
Optimus, our past alliances... Autobot, Decepticon...

235
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,860
都去他的吧 眼下 宇宙大帝复活了
no longer matter... not while Unicron lives.

236
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,240
请解释
Elaborate.

237
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,840
我们遇到了一个比机械党和霸天虎更具威胁的敌人
We found ourselves facing an even greater threat than M.E.C.H. or the Decepticons.

238
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,900
就在地球内部 字面上的内部
Literally an enemy within...

239
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,130
宇宙大帝…我知道这听起来很疯狂 不过我要是告诉你
Unicron. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but what if I told you

240
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,570
地球的核心跟科学理论的解释完全不同时
our planet's core isn't made up of what science has led us to believe it is?

241
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:29,180
福勒探员 看来我得中止这次会谈 让你先接受心理评估
Agent Fowler, I'm sorry to say I'm forced to discontinue this debriefing until you undergo a full psychological evaluation.

242
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,150
你是认真的吗？
Seriously?

243
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,700
作为美国政府的代表
As a representative of the United States Government

244
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,830
我认为你心智不大正常
I believe that you may have lost your sanity.

245
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,110
布莱斯将军 我向你保证我神志清醒
General Bryce, I assure you that I am quite sane.

246
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,430
此事与逻辑完全相悖 比尔 黑暗能量？
It defies all logic, Bill. Dark Energon?

247
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,660
然后又当着笔录员说
Then you go on record saying that you believe in

248
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,350
你相信头上长角的魔马？
magical horses with horns on their heads.

249
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,640
什么？
What?

250
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,510
你不是报告说 威震天协助打败了独角兽吗？
Do you deny previously reporting that Megatron helped defeat a Unicorn?

251
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,550
你以为…
That's what you...

252
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,000
宇宙―大帝！终极恶魔！
Unicron! The ultimate evil!

253
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,410
请划掉这一段
Permission to strike this from the record.

254
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,450
批准 不过警告你注意言辞
Granted. But consider yourself on notice.

255
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,650
你说过 威震天一度与我们联手
You were saying. Megatron proved to be an ally.

256
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,570
这种情况很罕见
The circumstances were unique.

257
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,080
相反 霸天虎中最有可能为我们所用的是红蜘蛛
Oddly, the 'con most likely to be of service is Starscream...

258
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,340
这只是权宜之计
only be default...

259
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,880
因为他对他自己的同伴的仇视 比对我们还深
because he may despise his team more than he despises ours.

260
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,160
不 主人！
No, master!

261
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,550
红蜘蛛在威震天面前一直三心二意
Starscream's loyalty to Megatron has always been questionable.

262
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,550
如果他真的和霸天虎决裂
If he has truly split from the Decepticons

263
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,060
这个了解军情的俘虏 也许是个值得结交的盟友
our prisoner's knowledge of their agendas could make him a valuable ally.

264
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,350
威震天不念旧情 想把我干掉
Megatron tried to extinguish my Spark in cold blood!

265
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,220
还有那个一心想取代我的混蛋毒蜘蛛
Then all that replaced me with that traitorous wretch, Arachnid.

266
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,880
她竟然丢下我不管！让我自生自灭！
She abandoned me! Left me for scrap!

267
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,340
所以 干嘛不过河拆桥呢？
So why not rat them out?

268
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,570
然而即便威震天一度试图处决他
But even after Megatron attempted to terminate him

269
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,500
红蜘蛛仍然试图赢得主人的欢心
Starscream still tried to win his master's faith.

270
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,900
威震天该对我刮目相看 我不光救了他
Imagine Megatron's appreciation when I not only rescue him

271
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,340
还抓了个汽车人
but deliver an Autobot.

272
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,600
那样一来 我就可以重振雄风了
I believe that would restore my stature quite nicely.

273
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:20,440
由于缺乏安全感 红蜘蛛比威震天更难以捉摸
Starscream's insecurity is what makes him less predictable than Megatron.

274
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,410
某种程度上 甚至更加危险…
And in some ways, even more dangerous.

275
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,290
我说的话就是圣旨 这儿我说了算！
I make the decisions here. I am in charge!

276
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,980
他真该分清楚自己到底是想要取代威震天 还是要在威震天面前得宠
He really needs to figure out if it's Megatron's job he wants or Megatron's approval.

277
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,500
我又要追问一下
I must, in turn, ask why successful termination of Starscream

278
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,520
为什么红蜘蛛还未被成功消灭？
has not been achieved.

279
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,140
空中优势一直使得虎子们占尽上风
Air superiority continues to provide the 'Cons with the upper hand.

280
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,850
个别时候 我们也能挫伤对方
though we manage to inflict the occasional setback.

281
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,580
但难以逆转劣势
But the fact remains...

282
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,680
红蜘蛛落跑以后 为我们提供了宝贵的情报
Starscream has supplied valuable intel since he went rogue.

283
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,030
我得到了关于你们领袖的情报
Starscream: "I have obtained information regarding your leader.

284
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,850
带上医疗箱
Bring medical kit."

285
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,970
不用担心 汽车人不会盲目地听信他
Not to worry. The bots know better than to trust him implicitly.

286
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:12,380
再靠近一步 就把你的小器官变成废铁
One step and your previous biomech is scrap.

287
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,540
幸运的是 尽管战略眼光独到
Fortunately for us, despite his strategic brilliance

288
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,940
红蜘蛛最大的敌人就是他自己
Starscream is his own worst enemy.

289
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,470
嗯 什么？
What?

290
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,230
呃 我的变形齿轮！
My T-cog!

291
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,600
你飞不起来了？
You're grounded?

292
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,430
他也不是唯一叛离威震天的人
And he isn't the only one who's taken flight from Megatron.

293
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,700
那只蜘蛛？
The spider.

294
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,980
毒蜘蛛 生性残忍
Airachnid, as sadistic as they come.

295
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,220
她和阿尔茜有着很深的过节
And she and Arcee have quite a history.

296
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,660
我总觉得
I can't help but feel the next time 

297
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,220
下一次她们将战个你死我活
they lock horns, only one's gonna walk away.

298
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
除非威震天先找到毒蜘蛛
Unless Megatron gets to Airachnid first.

299
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,770
所以说霸天虎的内斗一直不断？
So, the infighting among the Decepticon ranks continues.

300
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,160
不仅如此 威震天看似无法团结他的核心集团
And then some. Megatron can't seem to keep his inner circle holding hands.

301
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,410
你不认为我们能利用霸天虎的内斗吗
And you don't think we could take advantage of the chaos?

302
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,200
说服霸天虎投诚？
Motivate a Decepticon to join our cause?

303
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,620
有一名霸天虎受到擎天柱的尊敬
There is one whom Prime seems to respect.

304
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,400
尽管霸天虎改邪归正的可能性不大
While it is unlikely that any Decepticon will choose the path of good

305
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,670
但他们毕竟有改变命运的潜力
even they possess the potential for change.

306
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,630
但在目击骇翼夷平一座小镇后
But having witnessed Dreadwing tear up a town

307
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,490
我对他已不抱任何希望
I wouldn't hang my hopes on it.

308
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,010
我不得不说
So I must press the point...

309
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,950
既然擎天柱都相信霸天虎有投诚的潜质
if Optimus believes that even a Decepticon holds the potential for change

310
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,880
为什么汽车人就不会叛变呢？
why couldn't the reverse be true?

311
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,770
擎天柱在霸天虎阵营的那段时间里
No one truly knows what went on behind the Decepticon curtain

312
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,140
谁知道发生了什么？
while Optimus was off the grid?

313
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,410
你不了解 汽车人也不了解
Not you, not the Autobots.

314
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,270
关于这点 我百分之百的同意救护车所说的
I'm 100% with Ratchet on this one.

315
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,200
是否成为霸天虎需要做出选择 福勒探员
Being a Decepticon is a choice, Agent Fowler.

316
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,460
我绝不相信擎天柱会在有生之年做出这样的决定
one that I have a hard time believing Optimus would make at any point in his life.

317
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,460
奥利安・派克斯也许现在不知道自己是汽车人
Orion Pax may not currently be an Autobot up here

318
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,410
但我坚信在他的内心深处 绝不会放弃追逐理想
but I must believe he will never stop being one in here.

319
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,900
面对艰难的逆境和失忆
Against all odds, suffering amnesia

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,260
擎天柱仍然得以逃脱并且正面对抗威震天
Prime engineered his own escape to face down Megatron.

321
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,620
擎天柱会改变吗？
But is Prime capable of change?

322
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,500
你知道你的问题吗 擎天柱？
You know your problem, Optimus?

323
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,090
你是个如此高大 如此强壮的汽车人 却如此…优柔寡断
For such a big, strong bot, you're soft.

324
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,260
你没有抓住机会把威震天砸成废铁！
You didn't pound Megatron into scrap when you had the chance!

325
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,410
错失了那么多良机！
Many chances, in fact!

326
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,480
你可以用钻头把我杀掉
You might as well use your drill to finish me.

327
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,510
你还等什么？这是莫大的荣耀
What are you waiting for? Think of the glory?

328
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,260
机不可失 擎天柱会趁机动手的
Seize the day. Optimus would.

329
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,400
不 他不会
No, he wouldn't.

330
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,690
请告诉我擎天柱 你会放我一马吗？
So, tell me, Optimus, do you intend to take me alive

331
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,790
或是就此了结恩怨
or end this here and now?

332
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,070
擎天柱刚用实际行动证明
Prime has recently proven he's willing to go 

333
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,030
为了保护人类他不惜付出任何代价
further than ever to protect humanity.

334
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,740
擎天柱是一个真正的爱国者
Optimus Prime is a true patriot.

335
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,230
他和他的团队冒着生命危险
He and his team continue to risk their lives

336
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,680
日以继夜
day in and day out

337
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,080
并且不求任何回报
asking absolutely nothing in return.

338
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,410
万一你牺牲了 擎天柱
If you don't survive, Optimus

339
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,780
恐怕这星球也活不成了
I fear neither will this planet.

340
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
那好吧
Very well.

341
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,510
简单明了地说
The simple fact is

342
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,210
擎天柱的身体里没有一块坏电路
Prime doesn't have a bad circuit in his body.

343
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,750
快走啊 死老头！
Move it, gramps!

344
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,060
福勒探员 有这个必要吗？
Agent Fowler, is that really necessary?

345
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,500
作为跟汽车人的联系人
As liaison to the Autobots

346
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,620
我极力警告你们
I strongly caution that

347
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,090
现在怀疑擎天柱的奉献精神 绝对不合时宜
now would be the worst time to call Prime's dedication into question.

348
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,190
我们可能要面临一个前所未有的威胁
We're on the verge of an even greater threat than we faced before.

349
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,140
霸天虎们正在寻找来自塞博特恩的远古遗物
The Decepticons are on the hunt for long-buried relics from Cybertron.

350
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,870
初步情报显示这些是拥有神秘力量的圣物
Preliminary intel suggests they could be sacred objects with mystical properties

351
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,520
或是大规模杀伤性武器
or weapons of mass destruction.

352
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,540
神秘力量？
Mystical?

353
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,340
啊 这一行也划掉！
Uh, strike that, too!

354
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,460
我的中心意思是 啊！
The point I'm trying to make here is... Agh!

355
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,160
等一等！擎天柱？我需要帮助
Hold on! Prime? I need an assist.

356
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,330
福勒探员 你发现机械党成员了吗？
Agent Fowler, have you uncovered M.E.C.H. agents?

357
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,850
没有 不是他们
No. They're okay.

358
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,130
布莱斯将军想要了解你的健康状况
General Bryce here just needs to confirm the state of your health and welfare.

359
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,600
我很好 布莱斯将军
I am fine, General Bryce.

360
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,610
你好吗？
How are you?

361
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,920
我很好 战士？
I'm well, uh, soldier.

362
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,050
比尔 我想现在我能作一份有足够说服力的报告
Bill... I believe I have everything I need to make a persuasive case

363
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,900
证明擎天柱还健康地活着
that Optimus Prime is, indeed, alive and well.

364
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,990
同时坚定不移地站在我们这边
And firmly on our side.

365
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,860
我们很感激您的支持 长官
We appreciate your support, sir.

366
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,430
准许离开！
Dismissed.
