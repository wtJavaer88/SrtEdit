1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,310
在上一集里
Previously on "Transformers Prime"...

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,640
只有领袖之力能唤醒它！
It will only respond to the power of a Prime!

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,930
探测器发现了另一个铁堡信号！
Our sensors detected a second Iacon-locator beacon.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,690
我去
I'll go.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,190
烟幕选择的汽车形态 车门上印着一对招摇过市的38
Smokescreen chooses a vehicle mode with screaming double "38S" on the doors

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,650
很容易被辨识出来
making him an easy target.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,960
我没法假装我一点也不担心杰克的安危
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't more than concerned about Jack's safety.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,050
星辰剑…
The Star Saber

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,510
卓天越铸造的神兵利器！
a legendary weapon forged by Solus Prime.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,320
我们霸天虎…迎来了最黑暗的时刻
We Decepticons now face our darkest hour.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,810
我收到了一条信息…
I am receiving a message.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,670
谁发来的？
From who?

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,270
钛师傅
Alpha Trion.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,280
请原谅 威震天陛下
Forgive me, lord Megatron.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,050
属下丝毫不敢质疑您英明的战略性撤退
While I do not question the wisdom of our tactical retreat

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,600
现在 属下已准备好带领人马去反击汽车人了！
know that I am fully prepared to lead the troops in a counterattack against the Autobots.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,290
反击？
Counterattack?

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,150
你难道没看见
Perhaps you failed to notice Optimus Prime

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,200
擎天柱仅一击就切开了整座山吗？
cleave an entire mountain with a single blow.

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,800
只要有星辰剑在手
With the Star Saber in his possession

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,470
我的宿敌只须抬抬胳膊就能把我们斩尽杀绝！
my enemy can obliterate us all with a wave of his hand!

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,690
我必须让力量的天平重新向我们倾斜！
I must find a way to tip the balance of power back in our favor.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,300
我们不也拥有一个强大的先祖遗物么？
Do we not also possess a powerful relic of the ancients?

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,270
的确如此 那是卓天越之锤
Indeed... the forge of Solus Prime.

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,650
但如果不是握在领袖的手上 那东西就毫无用处…
But it is useless, except in the hand of a Prime.

26
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,210
若我有一只领袖之手
But I might wield that power

27
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,590
或许也能支配那神力
if I were to control such a hand!

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,300
擎天柱 钛师傅说了什么？
Optimus, what is Alpha Trion saying?

29
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,660
我真希望能在更好的境况下与你相会 擎天柱
I wish that I could meet you under better circumstances, Optimus Prime

30
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,180
但我担心铁堡无法撑过霸天虎的下一轮进攻了
but I fear that Iacon will not withstand the next Decepticon assault.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,360
于是你传话于我
So you speak to me

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,810
穿越时空的岁月？
from across the ages.

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,440
如果你听到了这则讯息
If you are listening to this message

34
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,040
那么我相信此刻你已经得到了星辰剑
then I take solace that you now possess the Star Saber.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,890
我确信你已经推断出了\N这些塞博特恩的遗物和霸天虎的武器
I am certain that you have deduced how these Cybertronian relics and Decepticon weapons

36
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,980
何以出现在如此遥远的世界
came to be found on such a remote world.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,940
没错 是我将它们传送过去的
Indeed, I transported them there

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,510
此举并非是防止它们落入敌手
not so much to keep them far from Megatron's hands

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,490
而是将它们传授与你…
but to ensure that they reach yours.

40
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,140
正如你长期以来所怀疑的
As you may have long suspected

41
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,470
“原始天尊圣约”不仅记载了过去 还能预示未来
the Covenant of Primus records events of the future as well as the past.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,370
根据我的不完全解读
My imperfect understanding of its runes

43
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,940
我对未来的景象得以惊鸿一瞥
affords me a shadowy glimpse of what is to come.

44
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,540
圣约中的一页预言道 你 擎天柱
The Covenant's pages foretold that you, Optimus Prime

45
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,990
将会前往一颗娇小但意义重大的星球
would journey to the small, but significant planet

46
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,810
并在那里谱写反霸天虎战争的新篇章
and there engage in a crucial chapter in the war against the Decepticons.

47
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,790
我既无法得知那场战争的前因
I know neither the nature of the battle

48
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,930
也不晓得后果 我只能寄望于
nor its outcome, I only hope that

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,020
这些先祖遗物能够在你\N最需要的时候助汽车人一臂之力
these relics of the ancients will aid the Autobots in your time of need.

50
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,400
最重要的是
Of utmost importance

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,870
再过不久
in a few moments

52
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,060
我就会将最后一批遗物传送出去
I will launch the last of the relics

53
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,780
这批意义最为重大 同时也是最强大的…
the most significant and powerful of them all.

54
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,080
放松 擎天柱
Easy, Optimus.

55
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,700
话说 钛师傅有没有跟我打招呼？
So, did Alpha try and ask about me?

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,700
那信息到底讲了什么？
What was the message?

57
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,310
找到最后四个铁堡遗物是我们的当务之急
It is paramount that we recover the final four Iacon relics...

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,600
它们是“终极之钥”…
the Omega keys.

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,620
钥匙？
Keys?

60
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,570
能打开什么？
To what?

61
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,290
我们的故乡涅重生的关键…
To the regeneration of our home planet.

62
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,620
地球的月亮不过是一块荒芜的石块 您说是么？
Earth's Moon is a barren rock, is it not?

63
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,060
的确如此 骇翼
Indeed, Dreadwing.

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,590
但月球并不是我们的目的地
But the Moon is not our destination.

65
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
一座太空桥？
A space bridge?

66
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,550
我们独有的太空桥
Our very own

67
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,610
自从汽车人在地球上发现了它 我们就将它搬至此处
relocated here after the Autobots discovered its whereabouts on Earth.

68
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,330
月球的背面能够掩人耳目 避开那些喜欢窥探的人类
The dark side of the Moon is hidden from prying human eyes.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,140
更重要的是
and, more importantly

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,860
汽车人也无法到达这里
well out of the Autobots' reach.

71
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,010
来吧 骇翼！
Come, Dreadwing!

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,470
我带你去一个地方 就在银河系里
We shall travel to the one place in the galaxy

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
我们将在那里得到能够击败擎天柱的东西！
which may provide us with a means of defeating Optimus Prime.

74
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,540
打好行囊
Pack your gear.

75
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,240
我们就要回塞博特恩了！
We're going back to Cybertron!

76
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,770
哈哈哈 信不信由你 大黄蜂！
Hahahaha. Well, believe it now, Bumblebee.

77
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,090
咱终于能回到文明社会了！
Civilization at last.

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,510
可我才刚初来乍到啊！
But I just got here.

79
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,250
还记得油浴吗？
Remember oil baths?

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,390
回去后我要做的第一件事\N就是在油里泡上整整一个太阳周期！
The first thing I'm gonna do planetside is soak for an entire solar cycle.

81
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,450
哈哈哈 我都等不及想告诉神子了！
Hahaha. I can't wait to tell Miko.

82
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,530
还有…杰克
And Jack.

83
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,540
擎天柱 钥匙是用来开门的
Uh... Optimus, keys open doors.

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,060
那东西真能让整个星球复活吗？
Can they really revive an entire planet?

85
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,050
我并不太清楚这些“终极之钥”的原理
While I am unfamiliar with the lore of these Omega keys

86
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,920
但钛师傅知晓其中的秘密
Alpha Trion knew many secrets

87
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,600
我们的先祖拥有许多神奇的科技
and the ancients possessed technology

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,810
在我们的现代科学中早已失传
that has long been lost to what we consider modern science.

89
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,120
故乡比我想象的还要颓败和荒芜…
The devastation to our home world is worse than I remember.

90
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,050
诅咒那些该死的汽车人！
Curse the Autobots to the pit!

91
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,160
尽管还不清楚功能和原理
Whatever their function

92
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,050
但有一件事可以确定
this much is certain...

93
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,420
那就是只有集齐四枚终极之钥 才能让塞博特恩复苏
we cannot restore Cybertron without all four Omega keys in our possession.

94
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,620
换言之 我们绝不能让威震天得到任何一枚！
Which means we can't afford to lose a single one to Megatron.

95
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,520
钛师傅的讯息里还剩下四组加密坐标
Four sets of coordinates from Alpha Trion remain encrypted.

96
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,450
我们可以推断出那就是终极之钥的位置
It is logical to conclude that each corresponds to the location of one of the Omega keys.

97
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,970
我一定会竭尽全力把它们全部破译
I must not waver until I decode them all.

98
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,120
故乡的未来就靠它了！
The future of our home world depends on it.

99
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,690
一座古墓！
A tomb.

100
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,730
据说这座古墓里长眠着一位元祖领袖！
One known to contain the remains of Primes.

101
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,390
拜托 别告诉我你不愿亵渎圣地！
Please tell me you're not averse to desecration.

102
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,960
我不过是有股情感在心头涌动而已
It is just that being in such a place evokes powerful emotions

103
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,480
想起了我孪生兄弟的悲惨命运…
considering the fate of my twin.

104
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,020
那你就更应该来到这里
Then you should delight in our purpose here

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,920
为了给天震
to exact our revenge of Skyquake

106
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,540
和所有牺牲的同胞复仇
and of all our fallen brethren.

107
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,970
你需要一个合适的方式携带这把利刃…
You shall require a more practical means of carrying such a blade.

108
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,960
我知道这听起来有些滑稽 但是…
I feel funny saying this, but

109
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,660
我不确定我是否真的愿意回去
I'm not sure I want to go back.

110
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,670
谁能想到呢 我们已经习惯新家的生活了
Who knew we'd ever get so used to our new home?

111
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,560
是啊 我永远都不想离开神子
Yeah. I don't think I'd ever want to leave Miko.

112
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,110
我们在这儿交到了朋友…和家人
We've made friends here, family.

113
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,800
我们不是还能常常…发短信嘛！
We could always... text them.

114
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,570
再说
Besides

115
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,660
咱们打了这么久 我都不知道自己还会不会干些别的了
been fighting for so long, I don't know if I can do anything else.

116
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,550
你可以再回去当建筑工人
You can go back into construction.

117
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,100
先祖的神力或许能让塞博特恩的核心重焕生机
The power of the ancients may breathe life back into Cybertron's core

118
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,140
但被战火摧毁的城市还是需要有人来重建的！
but our war-ravaged cities will surely require rebuilding.

119
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,270
我觉得暂时先别想这些旅行计划了
I wouldn't make any travel plans just yet.

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,340
咱们还得先找到终极之钥 要赶在虎子之前
We still have to locate these Omega keys and secure them before the 'Cons do.

121
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
那还不是手到擒来啊
Yeah, like that'll be a problem.

122
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,990
擎天柱可是有星辰剑在手呢！
Optimus has the Star Saber now.

123
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,820
威震天的末日指日可待了！
Megatron's end is in sight.

124
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,760
我当然可以 威震天陛下…
Yes, I can do it, lord Megatron

125
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,770
如果您确定这就是您想要的
if you're certain that's what you really want.

126
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,560
我比任何时候都坚决 医官
Like nothing I've ever desired before, Doctor.

127
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,120
开始催眠…
I shall induce stasis.

128
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,340
不！我要亲眼所见
No! I wish to bear witness

129
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,760
你将我的新肢体接驳上来
as you attach my new appendage.

130
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,860
我开始了
Coming up.

131
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,480
汽车人 我已经破译了第一个坐标
Autobots, I have decoded the first set of the final four coordinates.

132
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,460
大家分成小组 以防我在第一组回来之前
Divide into teams in the event

133
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,050
就破译出了第二个坐标
that I'm able to decode another before the first team returns.

134
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,950
我要进第一组！谁想一起来？
I'm on team one. Who's with me?

135
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,540
我来吧
I'll go.

136
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,680
您先请 长官
After you, sir...

137
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,250
…女士
ma'am...

138
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,260
…指挥官？
... commander?

139
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,530
这组合会很有趣…
This should be interesting.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,640
啊 哈哈哈哈 太好了…
Uh. Ha ha ha ha hahaha. Yes.

141
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,400
终于 领袖的力量现在属于我了！
At long last, the power of the Primes belongs to me!

142
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,950
第一组到达
First one is here.

143
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,470
没有信号
No locator beacon

144
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,880
也就是说遗物仍然被埋藏着
which means the relic's still buried

145
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,060
就在…那里！
right about... there.

146
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,070
卓天越之锤
The forge of Solus Prime

147
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,560
拥有能将原材料打造成任何东西的神力？
possesses the ability to create anything from raw material.

148
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,910
而现在
And in this case

149
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,730
那原材料可是一大块儿黑暗能量啊
said raw material would be a big hunk of Dark Energon.

150
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,700
那个 阿尔茜 我还欠你一份歉意
Uh, Arcee, I-I owe you an apology.

151
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,830
我从来没想过让杰克置身险境
I never meant to endanger Jack.

152
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,260
人类是很脆弱的 我现在彻底明白这一点了
Humans squish easily. I get that now.

153
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
这不光是因为杰克
This isn't just about Jack.

154
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,510
领袖卫队再也承受不起任何牺牲了
Team Prime can't afford any casualties

155
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,920
不管是人类还是汽车人！
human or bot.

156
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,960
我已经失去两个老搭档了
I've already lost two seasoned partners.

157
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,810
我不想在名单上再添一个菜鸟
I don't need a rookie on my scorecard.

158
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,050
绝不会的
Not gonna happen.

159
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,890
我以精英卫队的荣誉起誓
Elite guardsman's honor.

160
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,500
慢着 你失去过两个搭档？
Wait. You lost two partners?

161
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,950
你又破译了一组铁堡遗物的坐标？
You have decoded the next set of Iacon coordinates.

162
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,000
干得漂亮 声波！
Excellent work, Soundwave.

163
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,220
哈 人类还挺热衷把这些巨石堆到咱们的遗物上 是吧？
Ha. Nice of the humans to pile all these rocks on top of our relic, huh?

164
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,110
不言而喻 是吧？
Pretty much spells things out, doesn't it?

165
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,380
来 帮我移开这个！
Come on. Help me move this.

166
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,850
古代人类八成把终极之钥当成众神赐予的礼物了
The ancient humans must have thought the Omega key was a gift from the gods.

167
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,070
某种意义上讲 他们没错
And, in a sense, they weren't wrong.

168
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,570
快点 交出遗物
The relic... now!

169
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,390
二打一 我们能搞定他
Two against one. We can take him.

170
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,870
救护车 打开环陆桥 快！
Ratchet, ground bridge, now!

171
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,990
烟幕！
Smokescreen!

172
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,860
这次铁堡送来的又是怎样的宝物？
What manner of treasure did Iacon send us this time?

173
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,540
我可以现在就把你切成两半
I would slice you in two right now...

174
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,830
但我还想要你传个口信
but I need you to deliver a message.

175
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,260
告诉擎天柱 他要是想要遗物
Tell Optimus Prime that if he wants this relic

176
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,880
就亲自来抢！
he must come and claim it himself!

177
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,070
接着烟幕就…消失了
And then Smokescreen was just... gone...

178
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,850
好像烟消云散一般
like he turned to dust.

179
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,300
可怜的娃
Poor kid.

180
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,780
阿尔茜 别太自责
Arcee, do not blame yourself.

181
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,090
当时你也命在旦夕
It could just as easily have been you.

182
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,470
要我说我们这就去扒下威震天一块皮下来！
I say we go claim a piece of Megatron's miserable, metal hide!

183
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,650
不行 今天我们已经失去了一位战友了
No. We have already lost another one of our own today.

184
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,180
我不能再让任何人冒险
I will not risk more lives.

185
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,470
根据阿尔茜的所见
Given what Arcee witnessed

186
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,060
可以推断威震天拥有一件与星辰剑威力相当的武器
it stands to reason that Megatron now possesses might to equal the Star Saber

187
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,300
也就是说 只有我有可能夺回终极之钥
which means only I have a chance of recovering the Omega key.

188
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,890
塞博特恩的命运全指望它了
The fate of Cybertron rests upon its retrieval.

189
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,040
不管威震天明不明白
Whether Megatron knows it or not.

190
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,330
来拿你的战利品吧 擎天柱
Claim your prize, Optimus.

191
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,560
只要你拿得到
If you can.

192
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,540
火种源在上 威震天
By the Allspark, Megatron.

193
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,470
你做了什么？
What have you done?!

194
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,650
这个吗？
This.

195
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,460
它为我赢得了一些优势
I find it affords me certain advantages

196
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,740
比如使用卓天越之锤
such as the use of the Forge of Solus Prime.

197
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,360
这是我的第一件作品
My first creation

198
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,010
以宇宙大帝之血铸就
fashioned from the very blood of Unicron.

199
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,210
我称之为暗黑星辰剑
I call it the Dark Star Saber...

200
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,060
你也可以称它 屠戮领袖之剑！
slayer of Primes, if you will.

201
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,150
最终我们还是接受了命运的安排 擎天柱
At last we take our rightful places, Optimus.

202
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,530
逆天成神！我们挥舞着宇宙的力量！
As gods, wielding the power of the cosmos!

203
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,490
我只不过是个战士 威震天
I am but a soldier, Megatron

204
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,540
而你 只不过是被自我扭曲的妄想所囚禁的狂徒！
and you are a prisoner of your own twisted delusions!

205
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,610
我的暗黑星辰剑今晚已经啜饮过一个火种的鲜血
My Dark Star Saber has tasted one spark tonight.

206
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,510
它还渴望着吞噬一个领袖的生命！
It still thirsts for that of a Prime!

207
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,370
大幕将落 正如我所预见的一样！
And so it ends, just as I envisioned

208
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,680
我要用你的头颅来祭我的战利品！
with your head beside my new trophy.

209
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,800
哦 你是说这个？
Oh, you mean this?

210
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,710
谁找到归谁！
Finders keepers.

211
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,690
烟幕 退后！
Smokescreen, fall back!

212
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,680
救护车 打开环陆桥！
Ratchet, ground bridge!

213
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,340
不！
No!

214
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,930
没打中
Missed us.

215
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,160
逃吧 擎天柱 尽管逃吧！
Run, Optimus, run!

216
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,190
这些铁堡的小玩具救不了你的
Those trinkets from Iacon will not save you

217
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,580
因为现在我拥有了能斩断整个世界的力量！
not when I now possess the power to tear this world apart!

218
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,860
烟幕？
Smokescreen?!

219
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,720
以及第一个终极之钥！
And Omega key number one.

220
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,730
可 这是怎么…我是说 我亲眼看见…
But... how? I mean, I saw you...

221
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,530
我 呃 之前又“借”走了相位仪！
I, uh, decided to borrow the Phase shifter.

222
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,310
又一次！
Again?

223
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,930
幸亏我拿了
Good thing, too.

224
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,490
那阵冲击波简直像铁球一样砸在我身上！
The wave from the blast hit me like a wrecking ball.

225
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,570
一定是那冲击激活了相位仪
The impact must have activated the shifter.

226
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,390
我不知道昏迷了多久
I don't know how long I was unconscious

227
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,530
不过当我好不容易出来的时候
but when I made my way back outside

228
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,080
擎天柱和威震天正在进行一场史诗般的战斗！
Optimus and Megatron were deep in an epic throwdown.

229
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,830
我只是瞅准时机 做了该做的事…
I waited for the right moment to make my move.

230
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,290
你有进步
You're learning.

231
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
那么我能留着它吗？
So, can I keep it?

232
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,790
我是说 这玩意儿对我来说太好使了！
I mean, it is really working out for me.

233
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,300
好吧 好吧
Fine, fine.

234
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,700
好哎！我也有专属武器了！
Yes! Signature weapon!

235
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,110
你得到了你的武器 擎天柱却失去了他的
You got yours. Optimus lost his.

236
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,290
力量的天平又向另一方倾斜了
The balance of power shifted again.

237
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,310
虽说他仅能使用一天先祖留下的神力
While he may have wielded the power of the ancients for only one day

238
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,380
但擎天柱不依靠外力 仍旧是最伟大的战士
Optimus does not require it to be the mightiest of warriors.
