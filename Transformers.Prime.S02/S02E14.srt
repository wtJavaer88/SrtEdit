1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,020
在上一集中
Previously on Transformers Prime...

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,340
尽管下载到的铁堡数据不完整
Download of the Iacon database may have been incomplete

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,940
但我们已经拥有了战舰所破译的四个坐标
but we now possess four sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,520
如果我们想赶在霸天虎之前 得到铁堡的遗物
If we are to have any hope of recovering the Iacon relics before the Decepticons do

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,870
我们就必须分头行动
we must divide our resources.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,470
派出多支小队 同时前往这四个地点
Dispatching multiple squadrons will enable us to pursue all four coordinates simultaneously.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,910
我将前往南极
I will embark for the Antarctica.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,610
至于你 我的老朋友
As for you, old friend

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,480
我想让一个人陪同你执行任务
I would prefer that you have company on your mission.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,350
你不是认真的吧！
You can't be serious.

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,290
千斤顶桀骜不驯 粗俗无礼！
Wheeljack is insubordinate, a ruffian!

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,900
千斤顶是个强大的战士
Wheeljack is a highly capable warrior.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,450
由他暂时陪同对你有好处
You would be wise to welcome the temporary alliance.

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,200
头儿认为你需要支援 嗯？
The boss thought you needed backup, huh?

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,550
如果你一定要知道
If you must know

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,460
擎天柱强烈认为你需要监督！
Optimus feels strongly that you require supervision.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,360
我会好好表现的 大夫
I'll be sure to be on my best behavior, Doc.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,360
请不要叫我“大夫”！
Please, don't call me "Doc".

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,780
随便你怎么说 阳光老男孩
Whatever you say... sunshine.

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,130
呃…
En...

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,510
这么说 领袖卫队都去忙着寻找四个铁堡遗物了？
So, all of team Prime's busy chasing down these four Iacon relics?

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
这是目前所知的四个
The four which are currently in play.

23
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,440
还有更多？
There's more?

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,280
威震天拥有整个铁堡数据库
Megatron maintains possession of the entire Iacon database.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,910
我们需要查出其中还包含多少遗物
We have yet to learn how many more relics

26
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,050
或是霸天虎的大规模杀伤性武器
or Decepticon weapons of mass destruction it contains.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,150
别担心 大夫 我来罩着你！
No worries, Doc. I've got your back.

28
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,100
哦 我的名字不是“大夫”
My name is not "Doc"!

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,830
而且我也不需要任何人来帮忙！
And I do not require anyone watching my back!

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,220
在塞博特恩之战中我已经证实了自己的能力
I proved my metal during the war for Cybertron.

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,200
那我很荣幸能有你同行 战神
Then I'm lucky you're along for the ride, champ.

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,620
看来我们带了个尾巴
'Cause we got a bogie on our tail.

33
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,240
声波！
Soundwave!

34
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,240
威震天的通讯官？
Megatron's communications chief?

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,290
他一定也在追踪这个遗物
He must be tracking the same coordinates.

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,430
你最好抓紧扶手！
You might want to grab on to something.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,700
你是想把咱们都送进废料场吗？
Are you trying to send us to the scrap yard?

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,910
那是什么？
What's that?

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,500
声波的放哨喽罗 激光鸟！
Soundwave's surveillance drone, Laserbeak.

40
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,540
千斤顶 继续追击！
Wheeljack, maintain pursuit!

41
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,290
声波只是用它来转移我们的注意力！
Soundwave is merely using the drone to distract us.

42
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,650
我喜欢这个干扰
I welcome a good distraction.

43
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,580
猎人变成猎物了
The hunter becomes the hunted.

44
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,070
没时间进行追捕游戏了！
This is no time to be hot-dogging.

45
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,690
他跑了 现在我们要去找到声波…哇噢！
He is gone. Now, we can go find Soundwave.

46
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,690
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

47
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,820
千斤顶？千――斤――顶――！
Wheeljack? Wheeljaaack!

48
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,850
吃得消吗 虎子？
Took up that, Con!

49
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,350
你打中了！
You did it!

50
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,370
啊…右侧推进器烧毁了！
Right thruster's fried.

51
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,910
如果你听我的去追声波…
If you had pursuit Soundwave as I instructed...

52
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,620
他的小鸟还是会来啄我们的排气管！
His little birdie would still be pecking at our tailpipes.

53
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,710
好吧 我们需要立刻继续追踪遗物！
Well, we need to resume our search for the relic immediately.

54
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,560
声波没准儿已经找到它了！
Soundwave may already have reached it.

55
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,820
钻击号飞不了啦
The Jackhammer is not going anywhere.

56
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,520
要想追上那个虎子
If you wanna catch that Con

57
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,770
我们得靠轮子！
we need to roll.

58
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,350
那快决定啊！
Make up your mind.

59
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,430
是步行还是开过去？
Are we walking or are we driving?

60
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,100
千斤顶 注意保持距离！
Wheeljack, keep your distance.

61
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,800
激光鸟是声波的耳目！
Laserbeak is the eyes and ears of Soundwave.

62
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,390
它现在什么也不是了！
Not anymore, it isn't.

63
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,580
操作系统仍然完好 但停机了
Operating system appears functional but offline.

64
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,920
看来撞击损坏了它的光学和音频接收器
However the crash clearly damaged its optic and audio receptors.

65
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,330
看来有人得换侦察兵了！
Guess someone's gonna need a new snitch.

66
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,130
小胜一局 这不是我们此行的目的
A minor victory and not the one we're here to achieve.

67
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,340
在这等一会儿 大夫
Hang on there, Doc.

68
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,390
啊！
Oh!

69
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,490
这形势正适合玩一个老把戏
Situation's right for an old wrecker trick.

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,080
我…我不太明白
I am... not sure I follow.

71
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,100
声波早晚会寻回他的宠物
Sooner or later Soundwave's gonna come looking for his pet.

72
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,570
我们可以让他们重逢 回到基地
We let them reunite and return to base

73
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,050
同时带去一个手雷！
packing a light grenade.

74
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,970
等到声波去摸里面
The first time 'Wave reaches inside

75
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,910
他就会碰触到机关 然后 卡――砰！
it rips the bang and kaboom!

76
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,100
与其植入一个小小的燃烧弹
Why plant a mere insanitary device?

77
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,160
何不植入一个更具毁灭性的炸弹呢？
When we could plant a more devastating bomb.

78
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,610
一个病毒！
A virus.

79
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,230
通过激光鸟来感染声波
Engineered to pass from Laserbeak to Soundwave.

80
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,780
然后 直接侵入霸天虎战舰的主机
Then directly into the Decepticon warship's mainframe

81
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:11,650
通过它将整个铁堡数据库传送给我们
where it will transmit the content of the entire Iacon database to us.

82
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,430
听上去挺复杂 咱们不是在赶时间吗？
Sounds complicated. Thought we were in a hurry.

83
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,270
擎天柱会认同的
Optimus would agree.

84
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,150
赌上一个遗物 换取其余所有的遗物 值得一搏
Risking the loss of one relic to gain the rest is a worthwhile gamble.

85
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,320
你真的有能力编好这样的程序？
You really have a chance to pull off that kind of programming?

86
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,610
嗯…我一个人不行 还需要个帮手
Not alone. I will require backup.

87
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,140
拉斐尔 我们这里有情况
Raphael. We have a situation.

88
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,300
如果你能编写一段病毒源代码
If you could write a source code for the virus

89
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,340
我的扫描仪可以\N在上传过程中将它转译为塞博特恩代码
my scanner will translate it to Cybertronian script as it uploads.

90
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,610
我能行！
I can do it.

91
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,360
但如果我们想让病毒骗过虎子
but if you wanna keep the virus hidden from the 'Cons

92
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,160
我们需要一个诱饵 你知道的
we'll need a decoy, you know, 

93
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,840
比如伪装病毒
like a second virus.

94
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,380
可以更简单一点
Or something less complicated.

95
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,140
诱饵的意思是 我们希望被他们发现
A decoy as in... we wanted them to find it

96
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,640
但又不会爆炸？
but it doesn't blow?

97
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,070
正确
Correct.

98
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,640
可惜了一颗上好的手雷
Seems like a waste of a perfectly good grenade.

99
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,570
等等 手雷在激光鸟体内 激光鸟又在声波体内？
Wait a minute, a grenade inside of Laserbeak inside of Soundwave.

100
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,420
真像火鸭鸡！
Like a "turducken".

101
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,180
什么？
I'm sorry?

102
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,410
一个火鸡里填上鸭子 鸭子里填上…
It's a turkey stuffed with a duck, stuffed with...

103
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,450
…啊 算了！
nevermind.

104
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,030
你要去哪儿？
And where are you off to?

105
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,370
为你争取些时间 然后 说不定
To buy you some time, and who knows

106
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,130
还能捡个遗物回来
maybe to pick up a relic.

107
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,040
你东西掉了
You dropped something.

108
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,280
要玩点刺激的了
This should be fun.

109
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,050
我的拿手戏 不让人如愿
Here I go again... shattering expectations.

110
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,830
拉斐尔 我接入了激光鸟的上行传输器
Rafael, I jacked in the Laserbeak's supplying transmitter.

111
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,590
你准备好后 我会启动它的操作系统以接收数据
When you're ready I will bring its operating system back online and order it to receive the transfer.

112
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,290
有什么遗言吗？
Any last words?

113
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,150
对哦 闷骚型的
Right, silent type.

114
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,030
救护车 病毒编写完成 开始上传
Ratchet, the virus is coded. Commencing upload.

115
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,950
拉斐尔 我们的进展如何？
Rafael, what is our progress?

116
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,380
50%
50 percent.

117
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,880
呃 大夫？
Doc.

118
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,130
千斤顶 我告诉过你别那样叫我！
Wheeljack, I told you not to call me that!

119
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

120
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,280
怎么了？你在哪儿？
What's wrong, where are you?

121
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,030
我估计你还有两分钟
Think you got maybe... two minutes.

122
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,120
也许更少
Or less.

123
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,330
千斤顶你的情况如何？千斤顶？
Wheeljack, what is your condition? Wheeljack!

124
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,490
拉斐尔？
Rafael?

125
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,230
马上就好！
We're almost there.

126
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,210
完成！
Done.

127
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,440
糟了！
Scrap!

128
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,050
声波上钩了 千斤顶？
Soundwave has taken the bait. Wheeljack?

129
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,320
见鬼！
Scrap.

130
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,830
啊 共振炮！
The resonance blaster!

131
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,150
霸天虎科学家设计的最为强大的音波毁灭武器
Crafted by Decepticon scientist for maximum sonic devastation.

132
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,140
声波 你表现得很好
Soundwave, you have performed admirably

133
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,910
不像骇翼
unlike Dreadwing here

134
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,730
竟然将精锐护甲送到了红蜘蛛手上！
who somehow managed to loose the APEX armor to Starscream.

135
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,120
不过还有两组坐标
However, two more decrypted coordinates remain in play.

136
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,080
我很信任击倒 并且我…
And I have every confidence that Knockout and I...

137
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,780
你们能想象到汽车人对我做了什么吗？！
Can you believe what the autobots did to me?!

138
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,880
你找回遗物了吗？！
Did you retrieve the relic?

139
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,540
没有 主人
No, master.

140
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,280
那么我建议你现在修好激光鸟
Then I suggest you convince me of your continuing usefulness

141
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,950
以向我证明你仍有利用价值 医生
by examining Laserbeak, Doctor.

142
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,130
千斤顶！
Wheeljack!

143
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,090
啊 我只是休息下光学镜
Just resting my optics.

144
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,210
唔 和音频接收器
And my audio receptors.

145
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,200
怎么了？
What is it?

146
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,050
有某种阻塞物
An obstruction of some sort.

147
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,020
手雷！
Grenade!

148
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,380
啊 真聪明 击倒
Ah, that is clever. Knockout, 

149
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,710
准备好去处理下这个“阻塞物”
prepare to properly dispose of the obstruction.

150
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,270
声波 如果我们想保持对汽车人的优势…
Soundwave, if we're to maintain any advantage over the Autobots
