1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,030
在上一集里
Previously on Transformers Prime...

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,910
救护车 大黄蜂的发声器是怎么回事？
Ratchet, what happened to Bumblebee's voice box?

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,530
我们勇敢的侦察兵被霸天虎抓住并遭严刑逼供
Our brave scout was captured by Megatron's forces and interrogated.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,780
大黄蜂几乎成为了一堆废铁
Bumblebee was left for scrap

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,380
一位战地医生稳住了他的伤势
well, a field medic managed to stabilize his condition.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,810
不过那个医生…本可以做得更好
Though, the medic could've done better.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
火种源在上！
By the Allspark!

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,140
大黄蜂的变形齿轮不是损坏
Bumblebee's T-cog isn't damaged.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,290
而是不见了
It's missing!

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,110
那是一种变形关节吗？
Is that like a T-bone?

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
是我们用来扫描车辆和变形的器官
It's the organ that allows us to scan vehicles and transform.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,460
你来这儿做什么？
Why ARE you here?

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,990
来与你们结盟
To propose an alliance.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,510
变形齿轮不是技术产品 而是生理器官
A T-cog isn't technology. It is biology.

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:45,220
奥利安走之前留下的坐标还有两个
We possess two more sets of coordinates which Orion decrypted before departing our ranks.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,410
看看我们还能找到哪些失落已久的宝藏
Let us see what other long lost treasures we might be re-united with.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,310
这简直是糟糕透顶的主意…
Of all the scrap-brained ideas!

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,000
在大黄蜂失去车辆形态的时候\N带他去执行一个可能需要追击的任务？
Taking Bumblbee into a potential chase scenario when he no longer has the ability to access his wheels!?

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,550
是他硬要去的
He improvised.

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,600
嘿 小蜂醒了
Hey! Bee is waking up.

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,990
你已经失去了发声器和变形齿轮
You've already lost your voice-box and your T-cog.

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,190
现在连火种也不想要了吗？
Were you really trying to add your Spark to the list?

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,440
别气馁 大黄蜂
Don't say that Bumblebee.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,200
你并非一无是处
You are not useless!

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,340
听着 尽管我不想打断你们的伤感对白
Look. I hate to break up the pity-party

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,230
但虎子们刚刚把铁堡的第二件遗物收入了囊中
but the ‘Cons just added unknown Iacon Payday number 2 to their armory.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,410
责备或表扬都解决不了问题
Neither blame nor praise will modify past events.

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,810
但我们不能再承受不必要的风险了
But we cannot afford to take further unnecessary risks.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,280
大黄蜂 从现在起你不许离开基地
Bumblebee, you are not to leave our base.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,370
直到我们找回你的器官
Not until we can retrieve your missing biomechanism.

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,100
大黄蜂感到沮丧是正常反应
Bumblebee is right to be less than hopeful.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,840
但你我都知道有种办法能让他恢复健全
But you and I both know that exists a way to make him whole again.

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,910
器官移植 但那需要一个捐献者
A transplant. But that would require a donor.

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,750
你面前就站着一位捐献者
You need to look no further than the Autobot standing before you.

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,180
你很慷慨 老朋友
A generous offer, old friend.

36
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,700
但这不过是换一个人去坐轮椅罢了
But your solution would merely trade one Autobot's handicap for another's.

37
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,010
我不需要依赖变形齿轮…
I don't rely upon my T-cog!

38
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,510
不像大黄蜂那么需要
Not like Bumblebee does.

39
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,020
变形能力在我身上是一种浪费
The ability to transform is virtually wasted on me.

40
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,400
我整天都呆在这里
This is where I spend my days

41
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,040
我的思维和技艺才是我的价值体现
where my thoughts and hands are of value.

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,770
而并非武器和车轮
Not my weapons or wheels.

43
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,410
我们的队伍不能再少一个能上战场的战士了
Our team can't afford to be shy even one warrior in the field.

44
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,930
你说的有道理
You make a compelling case

45
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,750
但你要相信我们能够找回大黄蜂的变形齿轮
But know that we will find Bumblebee's T-cog.

46
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,140
擎天柱 机械党都是野蛮人
Optimus. M.E.C.H. - are savages.

47
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,090
谁知道他们已经对变形齿轮做了什么？
Who knows what damage they may have already inflicted upon it? Or...

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,830
谁知道我还能不能修好它？
 Or if I would be able to repair it?

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,750
救护车 你已经尽力了
Ratchet. You did everything in your power.

50
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,900
拜托
Puh-lease.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,310
你觉得这只是因为我没能修好大黄蜂的发声器吗？
Do you really think this is simply about my inability to restore Bumblebee's voicebox?

52
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,890
我…我只是为了我们的侦察兵好…
I... I just want to do what is right. For our scout.

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,040
为了我们的队伍
 For the team.

54
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,610
干得好 击倒
Excellent work, Knockout.

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,260
为您效犬马之劳 威震天陛下
I live to serve, Lord Megatron.

56
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,080
不过这到底是个什么玩意？
But what exactly is it?

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,510
啊！
Ah!

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,140
现在知道了吧？
Now you know.

59
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,410
我好像漏了点传动液…
I think I leaked a little transmission fluid.

60
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,120
锁定位置
Source located.

61
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,410
没错 很丰盛 不是吗 赛拉斯？
Yess. Gratifying, isn't it, Silas?

62
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,990
我常常建议威震天寻找人类盟友
I often advised Megatron to seek out human allies.

63
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,240
毕竟 似乎人类偶尔也能助汽车人一臂之力
After all, it seems to provide the Autobots with an occasional edge.

64
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,440
但作为一个声名在外的卓越战略家
But despite his reputation as a brilliant strategist

65
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,730
威震天竟然心胸狭窄到
Megatron is woefully small-minded

66
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,080
不愿跟比我们心胸更小的人类合作
when it comes to working with minds smaller than our own.

67
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,680
我是指在尺寸上
He was simply referring to... head size.

68
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,790
你这辈子闭过嘴吗？
Do you ever not speak?

69
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,320
我有说过我曾亲手解决掉一个汽车人吗？
Did I mention that I've personally extinguished an Autobot?

70
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,270
能量体 最纯净原始的姿态…
Energon... In its purest state.

71
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,040
正待开采
Ready to be mined.

72
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,380
还需要提炼 我的血肉同胞
And processed. My flesh-covered compatriot.

73
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,980
助我们成就霸业吧
To give us the edge.

74
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,560
很快我也会躺在病床上 不言而喻
Obviously, since I am the other patient involved

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,220
我将无法执行手术操作
... I will be unable to perform the surgery.

76
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,110
因此 你们中的一人必须来代替我
Therefore, one of you must serve as my proxy.

77
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,200
不行 你更擅长破坏
Nah-uh. Better at breaking things.

78
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,560
呼
Phew.

79
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,430
阿尔茜
Arcee.

80
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,470
擎天柱的手要更为稳健
Optimus has steadier hands.

81
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,690
稳是稳 但是太大了 伸不进我的身体
Steady, and much too large to be rooting around beneath my hood.

82
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,830
阿尔茜 你能行的
Arcee, you can do this.

83
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,260
你跟他们一样结实
You're steely as they come.

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,430
上战场可以 手术台却不行
On a battlefield, not in an operating theater.

85
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,350
都一样 你是主刀的 不是挨刀的
Same thing. As long as you're behind the knife. Not under it.

86
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,690
大黄蜂该不会从此变成一辆笨重的救护车了吧？
Does this mean Bumblebee's gonna transform into an ambulance from now on or be all cranky?

87
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,710
我只是觉得那样怪怪的
'cause that would be weird.

88
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,820
引导休眠
Inducing stasis.

89
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,500
啊 啊 啊 你可以等…
Yeah-yeah...

90
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,330
结束了再…
you can thank me... when...

91
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,410
谢我
it's over.

92
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,890
好了 大黄蜂
Okay, Bumblebee.

93
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,310
该你了
Your turn.

94
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,560
怎么了？
What's happening?

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,450
救护车没心跳了！
Ratchet's flatlining!

96
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,840
不是他
No he isn't!

97
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,020
是铁堡的定位信号
It's an Iacon homing beacon.

98
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,590
我们再次收到这个信号
If we’re picking up a signal

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,160
说明虎子们又挖出了一件遗物
it means the 'Cons just unearthed another relic.

100
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,200
汽车人 准备出发
Autobots, prepare to roll out!

101
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,820
好极了！
...Yess!

102
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,040
病人除外
Except for our patients.

103
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,930
最好中止休眠
It would be best to interrupt stasis.

104
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,920
擎天柱 重大新闻！
Prime! Breaking news.

105
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,270
嗯 擎天柱呢？
Huh? Where's Prime?

106
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,020
听着 告诉他…
Look. Let him know

107
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,360
我从卫星收到了图像信息
I've just received access to satellite imagery

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,940
我认为那是机械党的老巢
which I believe pinpoints the center of operations of MECH.

109
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,620
哦 慈爱的主啊…
Oh for the love of..!

110
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,570
找个能说话的来！
Give me someone who speaks something other than "bleep"!

111
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,840
我可以帮忙
I can help...

112
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,340
咋了 有哪个双生兽的发声器需要修理吗？
What?! Do I hear a Fuzor in need of voice-box repair?!

113
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,010
双生兽是什么？
What's a fuzor?!

114
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,890
那边怎么回事？
What's going on over there?

115
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,490
我能搞定
I am able!

116
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,440
不信去问嘲弄兽
Just ask Bantor.

117
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,800
他原来是只狒狒 后来我在他身体里塞进一只老虎
He was all mandrill before I put a tiger in his tank!

118
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,780
不行 小蜂 擎天柱说过不让你离开基地
But Bee! You heard what Optimus said about leaving the base.

119
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,630
把坐标发过来 福勒探员
Send the coordinates, Agent Fowler.

120
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,760
我们… 一定转交给擎天柱
We'll... make sure Optimus gets them.

121
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,780
我搞不懂
I don't get it.

122
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,190
磨坏了我的锤子
All this chipping away with my hammer

123
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,240
就只为了给威震天一把新锤子？
just to bring Megatron another hammer?

124
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,280
这锤子是13位元祖领袖的圣物
That "hammer" is a sacred relic of the thirteen original Primes.

125
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,800
真的?
Really??

126
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,990
那东西不是霸天虎的毁灭性武器？
Isn't that the opposite of Decepticon Doomsday Device?

127
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,850
这不难理解 除了缴获的霸天虎武器
It would stand to reason that in addition to confiscated Decepticon artillery

128
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:37,910
铁堡地下室中意义重大的宝物也被转移了出去
any artifacts of great significance stored in the vaults of Iacon would also have been shipped offworld.

129
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,090
而这是其中最为宝贵的…
And none would be greater than this.

130
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,970
卓天越之锤
The Forge of Solus Prime.

131
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,970
它具有把原料变成道具的神奇力量
For it possesses the power to mystically infuse raw material with working mechanisms.

132
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,880
就是说 要是我们有了它
As in... If we had it we can pound any weapon we can dream of into existence?

133
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,720
不如说我们有望为大黄蜂重新造一个变形齿轮
Or... possibly construct a new T-cog for Bumblebee.

134
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,310
进行融合
Initiate transfusion.

135
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
起作用了
It's working.

136
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,530
能量体 它能为我们未来的军队创造奇迹
Energon! It will do wonders for our future army.

137
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,390
你未来的军队
... your future army.

138
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,650
事实上 我们很快就能一睹这神奇的变形了
In fact, we are mere moments from beholding the miracle of transformation.

139
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,420
失去了变形齿轮 他没有武装
No T-cog! He's unarmed.

140
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,150
可以出土了
Time to get a grip.

141
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,750
汽车人 试试我的新涂层保护装备
Autobots! Check out my new finish-protector.

142
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,370
触手可及 又遥不可及
So close, and yet!

143
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,780
我们的位置和原型机暴露了
The location and prototype have been compromised!

144
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,300
消灭入侵者 拿回变形齿轮
Destroy the intruder and meet me at the rendezvous point!

145
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,970
然后与我会合
With my T-cog!

146
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,940
我不是你的小卒子！
I am not one of your foot-soldiers!

147
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,950
我是顾问！
I am a consultant!

148
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,060
再靠近一步 就把你的小器官变成废铁
One step, and your precious biomech is scrap.

149
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,350
救护车 你感觉怎么样？
Ratchet! How are you feeling?

150
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,210
很好 实际上 我感觉完全没有变化
Fine. In fact, I feel as though nothing has changed.

151
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,000
擎天柱！
Prime!

152
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,620
怎么了 福勒探员？
What is it, Agent Fowler?

153
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
擎天柱去那个坐标了吗？
Has Prime received the coordinates?

154
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,910
坐标？
Coordinates?

155
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,040
疑似机械党的据点！
Possible MECH location!

156
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,780
半小时前我就把坐标发过去了！
I've sent them half an hour ago!

157
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,680
呃 别担心 福勒探员
Um, don't worry, Agent Fowler

158
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,080
这件事正在处理
it's taken care of.

159
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,050
擎天柱还在和虎子们缠斗
Optimus had to go lock fenders with some 'Cons.

160
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,510
所以 大黄蜂替他去了
So... Bumblebee went instead.

161
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,590
什么？
What?!

162
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,180
大黄蜂不能去！
Bumblebee can't do that!

163
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,470
他还在手术恢复期！
He's recovering from surgery!

164
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,470
关于那个嘛…
About that...

165
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,510
怎么着？你要开枪吗？
Or you'll what? Shoot?

166
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,210
多么悲惨 无法变成车辆形态
How sad to be incapable of achieving vehicle mode

167
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,030
无法体会高速的快感
experiencing the sensation of speed!

168
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,410
作为一个失败的汽车人
How very pathetic...

169
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,910
真是可怜
to be a failure as an Autobot.

170
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,680
啊!
Ahhh!

171
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,280
我要飞啦 因为我能！
Time to jet! Because I can!

172
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,860
我的变形齿轮
My T-cog.

173
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,650
哦 那个
Yes... that.

174
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,800
很可惜 在惨烈的战斗中它被摧毁了
Unfortunately, it was destroyed during the ferocity of battle.

175
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,300
嗯 只是一个暂时的小插曲
A temporary setback.

176
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,560
还有其他汽车人 其他的变形齿轮
Other Autobots, other T-cogs.

177
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,440
我们很快就能找到另一个
we shall find a replacement soon enough.

178
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,490
那不够快
Not "soon enough".

179
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,140
现在就要！
Now!

180
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,420
啊啊啊!
Aghhhh!

181
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,840
因为他发明了将护盾发生器用于输出的战术
For the most creative use of a shield generator in a supporting role

182
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,420
所以获胜的将是击倒！
the winner is... Knockout!

183
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,960
我的更大
Mine's bigger!

184
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,350
隔板！
Bulkhead!

185
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,900
三思！
Nah-uh.

186
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,370
在地球上找到了领袖的圣物？
A relic of Primes here on Earth?

187
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,500
奥利安・派克斯再一次
The Decepticon Cause is once again

188
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,910
为霸天虎事业作出了伟大贡献
indebted to the contributions of Orion Pax.

189
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,060
我还好
... I'm fine.

190
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,310
擎天柱 我们有理由确信
Optimus!

191
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,210
我们找到了机械党的老巢
We have reason to believe we have located MECH's center of operations.

192
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,450
大黄蜂已经去了
Bumblebee is already there.

193
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,710
嗯 什么？
... What?

194
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,060
汽车人!
Autobots!!

195
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,550
我的变形齿轮！
... My T-cog!

196
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,570
救护车 重新打开环陆桥 准备手术
Ratchet. Re-open the Groundbridge. And prepare for surgery.

197
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,200
都怪我 威震天拿到了铸锤
Thanks to me, Megatron has the Forge.

198
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,790
卓天越之锤的确对我们大有用处
While we would’ve put the Forge of Solus Prime to valuable use

199
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,950
但我们无需担忧威震天拿到它
I do not believe we have reason to fear Megatron's possesion of it.

200
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,460
嗯 这看起来不象是\N巨无霸福特堡垒级的核子冲击炮
Uh, It doesn't look like a Fortress Maximus' grade nucleon shock cannon.

201
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,480
正如我设想的一样
It is as I suspected.

202
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,380
没有领袖力量去激活它
Without the power of a Prime to activate it

203
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,400
这个锤子只能被扔进工具箱
the Forge is merely another addition to our tool-chest.

204
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:52,550
不过有一点 我们必须尽可能避免让领袖拿到它
One we must nonetheless keep as far as possible from the reach of a Prime.

205
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,820
我…尽力了
I... did what I could.

206
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,000
我们的侦察员已经得到了最好的治疗 老朋友
Our scout could not have been in better hands, old friend.

207
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,920
我们不能再移植救护车的变形齿轮给大黄蜂了？
And we didn’t stick with Plan A and let Ratchet donate his cog -- why?

208
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,530
大黄蜂不会接受的
Bumblebee wouldn't accept it.

209
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,280
大黄蜂 轻一点！
Bumblebee! Easy.

210
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,250
慢点 你需要时间恢复
Please! Recovery takes time.

211
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,280
创伤十分严重
The damage was... severe.

212
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
去哪儿都行
Hah, anywhere!

213
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,150
尽管开吧
Just drive!

214
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,440
小心点
Go easy!

215
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,570
注意遵守试驾流程！
Adhere to standard break-in procedure!

216
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,580
哇喔!
Ho-ho.

217
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,860
当时小蜂的变形齿轮看起来都要进废品堆了
Bee's T-cog looked like ready for the scrapyard.

218
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,320
难以置信 医官能把它修好
Hard to believe that Doc repaired it.

219
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,590
救护车今天修好的可不仅仅是一个变形齿轮
That is not all that Ratchet repaired today.
